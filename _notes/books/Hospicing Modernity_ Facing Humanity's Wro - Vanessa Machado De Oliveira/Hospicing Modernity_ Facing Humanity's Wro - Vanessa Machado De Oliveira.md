# Hospicing Modernity

## Facing Humanity’s Wrongs and the Implications for Social Activism

Vanessa Machado de Oliveira

![[NABmark_stacked.png]]  

# Praise for _Hospicing Modernity_

> _“Beyond a mere critique of modernity, this is a book written for us as people who struggle with the everyday manifestations of modern power. Clear, creative, and cogent, the work offers cutting-edge philosophy at the same time that it furnishes usable guidance for how to cope with the coming perils of colonialism and capitalism. It’s a book for the future, yet written to meet us where we are at right now as individuals living with trauma and facing ethical dilemmas about what it means to take meaningful actions under conditions of complexity.”_
> 
> —Kyle Whyte, PhD, George Willis Pack Professor of Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan

> _“Asking the question ‘What if racism, colonialism, and all other forms of toxic and contagious divisions are preventable social diseases?’, _Hospicing Modernity_ invites its reader to dare and educate themselves by undergoing a process of self-unmaking. Drawing on and moving beyond traditions of radical pedagogy, such as those inspired by Paulo Freire, Vanessa Machado de Oliveira has created a powerful tool for uncovering, undoing, and recovering from the deadly ways in which modernity also lives and dies as humans experience it subjectively.”_
> 
> —Denise Ferreira da Silva, PhD, professor at the University of British Columbia Social Justice Institute and author of _Toward a Global Idea of Race_ and _Unpayable Debt_

> _“This book is rude. Like the shaman’s confident cackle. Like the punch of an elder whose eyes shimmer with a secret. Like a trickster’s feverish dance to a drumbeat in a time supposedly passed. And right there—my fellow modern citizen—right there, in the author’s cosmological rudeness, lies her deepest medicine. Her generous gift to the need to upset the terraforming coloniality of white modernity. Navigating her rigorous work is an exercise in defamiliarizing modernity as the air we breathe, the site of our persistent illnesses, and the earthly thing that can give way to something else. It is time to gather. We can start here, together.”_
> 
> —Bayo Akomolafe, PhD, author of _These Wilds Beyond Our Fences_

> _“This is not an ordinary book and it may not be for everyone: it is a thought experiment that skillfully and creatively creates conditions for us to shed our arrogance and to get our proverbial shit together. The author puts it beautifully but bluntly: she lovingly does not care about ‘what’ you think: your delusions of ends and means and your sense of self-importance are part of the problem. The book is about the necessary expansion of our capacity for dealing with difficult and painful things, to sit in complexity and uncertainty, to show up to difficult conversations and to exist differently and, put frankly, to grow up. It does not matter if you agree or not with the premise that modernity is dying and in need of ‘hospicing.’ If you take it hypothetically, and engage with the exercises, you will be a more decent human being as a result of reading this book. If what the author is saying resonates, if you are ready to do this difficult work, get over yourself and read it, for the sake of the people around you, and of the planet.”_
> 
> —Dan McCarthy, PhD, director of the University of Waterloo Institute for Social Innovation and Resilience (WISIR)

> _“This is not a book to be picked up lightly. Vanessa Machado de Oliveira is carrying stories that will do things with you. Her book will change you, if you let it. There’s strong medicine here, badly needed. There are clues to how we find the paths that lead to the unknown world ahead, beyond the end of the world as we know it.”_
> 
> —Dougald Hine, cofounder of the Dark Mountain Project and A School Called HOME

> _“This is a book about breaking spells. And not just the obvious kind, but the grievously impacted, deep-in-the-psyche variety. Important and powerful, _Hospicing Modernity_ diligently tracks a complex word—modernity—through the bewildering forest of our times. Variety of approach is part of its effectiveness: intelligence and instinct form a weave rather than a stand off, and underneath it all is Machado de Oliveira’s tracking of stories that make a world, not just describe a world. That’s a very beautiful, very subtle distinction. And once you see it, you can’t un-see it._
> 
> _This is not a book to promote comfort, but to seek shelter. Admirably pragmatic, it guides us away from conceptual sedatives into much livelier, sophisticated ground. The primordial shelter of stories both personal and mythic, that humbly suggest we have work to do. Stories that dare to be teachings, that have the perfume of a wider earth infused within them. Colonial intent doesn’t go away with pulling down a few statues; its primary habitation is the unconscious. Machado de Oliveira’s book challenges us to get conscious. Not in an inhibited, neurotic fashion, but with an artful gaze, with grit, and a little playfulness._
> 
> —Martin Shaw, PhD, author of _Courting the Wild Twin_

> _“This is an outstanding book—truly original and profoundly perceptive in its contents and arguments, and multimodal in its pedagogic approach. It examines a range of urgent philosophical issues about modernity and its deep contradictions, and the ways in which its inevitable demise might be steered toward more morally and culturally productive futures. It is a book that is not only thought provoking but also helpful in guiding genuinely worthwhile discussions.”_
> 
> —Fazal Rizvi, PhD, emeritus professor at the University of Melbourne and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

> _“Vulnerability is the new spice of life, and nowhere does it take centre stage more than in Machado de Oliveira’s book. Here, we see fallability being repositioned as a virtue: it should never have been set aside! In a suite of stories, informed in part by Indigenous thinking, Machado de Oliveira ruptures certainty with the void that many Indigenous peoples have recognized for millennia, pushing the reader over the edge into mocking darkness. The reader (and the world at large) must now make a choice: does our agency lie in tentatively plaiting the gloom we’re in, to make sense of our predicament and to try and grapple with it, or do we default to the brilliant intellect and its offer of comfortable certainty? Machado de Oliveira has established that we need to do the former and, with the telling of fragility, she promotes a new strength through mystery. Beware, though: this is not a book for the fainthearted. Be prepared to be confronted by the world—don’t expect to have it nicely served up. The work she calls for is difficult, but ultimately it is the world that is at stake.”_
> 
> —Carl Mika, PhD, director of the Centre for Global Studies at the University of Waikato and author of _Indigenous Education and the Metaphysics of Presence_

> _“For Indigenous communities, the teachings that are necessary for engagement with sacred plants are very rigorous and require a lot of discipline. Informed by these teachings, this book is a call for responsibility and for collective healing, as we face the demise of the house of modernity, a house built upon delusions of separation and superiority. I invite you to read this book as a ritual that can prepare us to do the work that is necessary to interrupt the harm humanity is inflicting on itself and on the planet.”_
> 
> —Ninawa Huni Kui, president of the Federation of the Huni Kui Indigenous People of Acre

> _“_Hospicing Modernity_ offers an unflinching and courageous examination of the predicament of our world in the twenty-first century, weaving trenchant critique with pedagogical hope and sensitivity. It invites us to participate in a form of fieldwork that connects the very sense of who ‘we’ are with global legacies of harm that modernity and coloniality have wrought. It is a book of acute vision and insight, and taps into that most underused faculty we so desperately need to attend to ‘the end of the world as we know it’: the imagination. Through a series of thought experiments, Vanessa Machado de Oliveira compels us to truly face the enormity of planetary crises as well as the seemingly benign ways we are complicit in them. Written in a tone that directly addresses the reader through stories, metaphors, and rich imagery, this book resonates with the vitality of life itself, taking us on a transformative educational journey that inspires us to take seriously our profound interconnection to all others—past, present, and future—with whom we share this world.”_
> 
> —Sharon Todd, professor of education at Maynooth University, Ireland

> _“We need to heal the ways we think, feel, relate, exchange, and exist as part of Pachamama. The only possible answer is healing in ayni—as a collective body. In this work you cannot be afraid of or run away from pain. Sacred plants can give us a leg up, but we need to do half of the work ourselves. This book carries hummingbird medicine. It translates the training of an apprentice learning to listen to the land to recalibrate her journey toward sobriety, maturity, discernment, and accountability. It can support others committed to this work to do the same.”_

# Preface

My Grandmothers' Gifts

Within modernity, we are conditioned to want to cover everything with a heavy blanket of fixed meanings, to index reality in language, to word the world. Carl Mika, a Māori philosopher and friend, suggests that instead of _“wording_ the world,” when language manifests as an entity, it _“worlds_ the world” and this opens other possibilities for experiencing existence within the world.[^1]

There are significant implications of working with language to _world_ the world, especially in relation to our relationship with stories. In _wording_ the world, we are socialized to treat stories as tools of communication that enable us to describe reality, prescribe the future, and accumulate knowledge. In _worlding_ the world, stories are living entities that emerge from and move things in the world. Some of these stories are meant to exist for a long time, others expire early. Some stories are meant to remain as and where they are and to work only with a very select group of people; other stories are meant to travel the world, and to transform and to be transformed by other world-entities, including the storytellers and those who receive the stories. These are the types of stories you will encounter in this book.

Sometimes _worlding_ stories can create micro or macro movements, in all directions, as soon as they arrive. Sometimes they will hide somewhere in your body, perhaps close to a song that already lives there, and wait for the right time to dance with you. Sometimes they will do their work undercover, in alliance with other resident stories. Other times they will be rejected, ignored, hated, or attacked by other stories that live within you. When mobilized in this way, stories feel like they interact with your body physically (and they do!).

As I started to write this book, I was very reluctant to have personal stories show up in public. Little did I know that they were planning a coup. I actually asked these stories to stay away, but they had a different idea. However, the more they revealed themselves, the more I agreed that their work was indispensable for what this book needed to do. “Fine,” I said begrudgingly, half-worried, half-curious about what they were planning behind my back.

As the stories were moving with my hands and the computer keyboard, I heard them wondering about the different bodies they would encounter. Some stories may have shown themselves in this book especially for you, others showed up for different readers from different contexts, who occupy different positionalities. You may feel connected to some stories but not to others. The stories in this preface give you an idea of where the stories in other chapters are coming from. They give you a brief overview of the personal and academic trajectories that made this book possible. But please be mindful that this (and any other narrative) can never be the “full story.”

From a Cradle of Paradoxes

I was born in a mixed-heritage family of cultures in dissonance, of German and Indigenous ancestry in a place known as Brazil. My personal and professional pathways have been deeply marked by the lived experience of a microcosm of colonial violence, where paradoxes were abundant and where love was deeply entangled with historical and systemic trauma. Both my Guaraní (Indigenous) and German grandmothers were alphabetically illiterate and both spoke Portuguese as a second language. I am the first woman in my family to go to university, and this happened despite my strong disidentification with formal schooling, which was one of the reasons I dropped out of high school as a teenager.

My father married my mother out of a paradoxical—both progressive and highly problematic—desire to change the world. His grandparents had lost everything in Germany and emigrated to Brazil right after World War I. His German mother was forced to marry for material security, but they lost everything again. As a German-speaking family, they were persecuted in Brazil during World War II. My German grandmother, vó Vitória, raised six children by herself as a seamstress moving between different European colonies in the south of Brazil from the 1940s to the 1960s.

My father’s brothers were involved in agricultural expansion into Indigenous lands in the 1960s, which was part and parcel of Indigenous genocide in Brazil. My father wanted to take a stance against the violence toward Indigenous people that his brothers were supporting. Influenced by the belief in German cultural supremacy inherited from his family, as well as Western (cowboy) films and literature he was exposed to as a child, he decided to marry an Indigenous woman to “save” her from state-sanctioned violence. His long-term project was to give their future mixed-heritage children the European genetic stock that was necessary to have the opportunity for social enfranchisement.

This social enfranchisement by genetic assistance is also deeply paradoxical and comes at great cost. I have written about this before, using the analogy of being carried up a ladder of social mobility that stands on the broken backs of piling bodies of other human and nonhuman beings. To be carried up is to make a deal, a transaction that involves acceptance of being a burden and incurring an unpayable debt. My mother accepted the deal together with its devastating implications for her sense of self and self-worth. She did so despite the warnings of vó Vitalina, my Indigenous grandmother and her mother, who insisted that not only was this a terrible deal, but also that the ladder itself was not going to last because it was both violent and unsustainable. She used to say that the house the European man built on the backs of Indigenous peoples would eventually fall, and that we’d better take cover when it happened.

My father understood that the system was rigged, but he enjoyed the benefits afforded by it. He ignored the ironic fact that the benefits and social mobility he sought were made possible only by the structural injustices he was trying to fight against by marrying my mother_._ Vó Vitalina’s analogies pointed exactly to that problem. She was warning my mother that the promises and securities of social mobility were not meant to last: one day we would need to reckon with the violence and unsustainability of the ladder.

The Complexities of the In-Between

Both of my parents were concerned about being perceived as a “normal” family. It was after several racist incidents involving teachers, salespeople, and neighbors that I understood the risks we faced as a mixed-heritage family challenging racial expectations of marriage of that place and time. During incidents when I, my brother, or my mother were being victimized, my father always stood up for the family in his Germanness, insisting on us all being treated according to his racial privilege, often to our dismay and visible embarrassment.

My father tells the story of a particularly intense summer when I was a toddler. He had been sunburned and become utterly pink, while I had become ten shades darker. He went to the store carrying me in his arms and he was approached by a woman who congratulated him on adopting a child in need “from the streets.” Needless to say, my father got really angry and made everyone in the store know I was _his_ child and that I was _not_ not-white, which must have been really confusing for everyone involved (including me). These were common occurrences. It was also common then for me to want to wash my skin color off with soap, so that these incidents would no longer happen.

I was taught indirectly, by both of my parents, that there are deep contradictions between thinking, saying, and doing. That, for example, one can build a specific identity holding and expressing highly problematic views about other people, and then show up in a critical situation involving said people in completely selfless ways that totally contradict those views or one’s self-image. Conversely, people can build a virtuous identity and promote the most beautiful values and ethical commitments, but when pushed to the edge, make decisions or act in ways that completely negate those values and commitments.

My father expected us to be grateful for the sacrifices he had made in choosing to marry my mum rather than someone from his own cultural background. Both my father and my mother expected diligence, discipline, and reverence toward the social mobility ladder representing the social order that would give my family the class privileges and securities my parents aspired to. They both felt they had sacrificed much in order to give me and my brother access to this opportunity. Our lack of interest in the path they had projected for us was initially perceived as a betrayal of these sacrifices.

In my state of rebellion against my parents’ expectations, I sought out many stories on both sides of the family. On both sides, I found experiences of dispossession, destitution, and displacement; and sexual, class, and racial violence. However, the experiences were very different in relation to Indigenous genocide. The weight of these Indigenous stories cannot be fully expressed by logic. The closest I came to touching these experiences was through writing a poem that illustrates how trauma travels and manifests differently in different generations. The first verse is about my grandmother Vitalina (She), then my mother (Girl), and finishing with me (she).

Being Born “Índia”

She being born “índia,” stubborn and free

She being sent to Catholic mission school

She running away

She being forced to marry older white man

She bearing his child

She running away again

She back to nomadic life with community

She having many partners there and elsewhere

She banished from settled Indigenous community that turned Catholic

She constantly refusing to assimilate

_But still singing songs at the church out of tune and out loud, on purpose_

Community disappeared

Last brown baby girl born in the streets

Mother and toddler saved from destitution

By former husband

Girl raised by old white man as loving father figure

Girl sees Indigeneity as shame and dispossession

Girl seeks enfranchisement

Girl loses adoptive father and promised comforts early

Girl repudiates mother’s reputation

Girl repeats mother’s patterns of relationship

Girl saved again by white man

Girl agrees with social mobility deal

Girl wants her children not to struggle

Girl insists her mother joins family in city

Girl loses mother who prefers to die in and with the land

she is born, still stubborn, but not free

she has Indigenous blood both in her veins and on her hands

her body overcrowded by ancestral lines in dissonance

she suffocates in this body

her flesh pulled in opposite directions

she believing her life is a mistake

her parents forcing assimilation

she failing to want it

her parents fearing destitution

she not afraid of it

her parents blaming her for failure

she finding freedom in it

her parents believed

their project had failed,

they had sacrificed in vain

because just like her grandmother,

who refused the ladder,

“she will die as a nobody,

in the middle of nowhere”

Existing in between cultures in historical dissonance can be painfully complicated. As a teenager, I gave up on living a few times. I hated my body. I left home and dropped out of school. I became a single teenage mum at sixteen. I ended up in violent relationships, then at a woman’s shelter. My body got hurt and broken, and I nearly died in a car accident. The odds were definitely not good. Everything happened very early, very quickly, very intensely. If I had not found support to barely get it together, I am certain I would not have survived. My undergraduate degree was completed in evening classes at a public university while I worked as a teacher fifty-eight hours a week (including weekends), in three shifts, in different towns. This was 1997.

Academic Trajectory

Fast forward to 2021: my academic profile states that I hold a Canada Research Chair in Race, Inequalities and Global Change. I have worked at different universities internationally since 2004; and have been a tenured full professor at the Department of Educational Studies at Canada’s University of British Columbia, since 2017. I have held academic positions in Ireland, Aotearoa/New Zealand, and Finland, where I became a full professor at age thirty-four. I have worked extensively with teachers, NGOs, professional associations, governments, social movements, and communities.

My work has identified and offered alternatives to common problematic patterns in international and community relations, particularly in the areas of global education and Indigenous engagement. I have been a strong critic of prevalent educational approaches that reproduce paternalistic forms of relationships; simplistic solutions to complex problems; and ethnocentric ideals of sustainability, equity, justice, and change. Through my scholarship and service, I have critically examined existing practices of engagement and representation related to poverty, development, progress, and sustainability in different educational contexts. I have offered generative conceptual clarifications that supported policy and curricular changes; cocreated alternatives to existing practices; mentored colleagues and students; and fostered innovative partnerships in knowledge production, mobilization, and translation across sectors and disciplines.

This academic trajectory was not intentional—quite the contrary. My motivation to stay in academia was never about an academic career, but about securing a space of collaborative experimentation with other communities. This journey has been unanticipated, and both painful and instructive. Black, Indigenous, and racialized people are perceived to enter modern institutions through the back door. We are expected to be in and of service to those who see themselves as the rightful heirs of the academic ivory tower. Regardless of what we actually do, the impact of what we do, or want to do, from an institutional perspective our main job is to make “diversity” work in ways that make people feel comfortable and that allow business to go on as usual. We are expected to feel grateful and indebted for the opportunity to contribute. If we meet expectations, we are supported and lifted up. If we refuse to comply, if we decide to rock the boat, our competency is questioned; our work scrutinized; and direct and indirect retaliation, penalties, and punishments become routine.

Both of my grandmothers have helped me survive institutional racism. Vó Vitória was a role model of work stamina. She also taught me how to sew together different pieces of fabric. For me this is what academic writing is about, which has helped immensely with productivity. Vó Vitalina taught me courage and irreverence: I too am singing in their church, out of tune and out loud, on purpose. And I will do it for as long as this is generative for the communities that I work with and the work that needs to be done.

“Medicines”

I believe that my particular trajectory made me a specialist in articulating paradoxes at the interface of colonial encounters. I was conceived through one of these paradoxes and the experiences in my life led me to look for paradoxes in different contexts, such as in education, and in efforts toward social and global justice. Since people tend to turn away when paradoxes are presented through logic, I have learned to translate them into stories, _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira, metaphors, and pedagogical exercises. This is what I call one of the “medicines” that I carry. I might also say that I am a specialist in identifying some of the complexities of colonial violence, having witnessed how these complexities manifest within and around me over the course of my life. On good days I may also carry—for myself and others—the medicine of holding spaces where heavy things can be held and difficult movements can happen without relationships falling apart. This medicine is always necessary, both for keeping my family together and for safely raising painful, risky topics of conversation in academia without immediately being shut down.

This book is an attempt to bring these medicines together. These may be exactly the medicines you need right now—or not. This book also presents teachings I have received when collaborating with other people,[^2] in particular the Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures arts/research/ecology collective and the Indigenous network Teia das 5 Curas. It is important to say from the outset that when I engage with Indigenous knowledges in some of the chapters, I do not intend to represent or to speak for Indigenous individuals or communities. Indigenous groups are as diverse and complex as non-Indigenous groups; and questions about where, how, by, and with whom Indigenous knowledges should be shared are contested issues. In cases when specific Indigenous stories are shared in this book, permission was granted by Indigenous storytellers.

What I present in this book are translations of what I have been taught about modernity keeping us in an immature state; and the need for a political practice of healing, of radical tenderness, that can enable us to step up, to grow up, and to show up differently. This involves unlearning our learned ways: of thinking and imagining; of sensing and feeling; of relating to one another, the earth, and the cosmos; of facing life, fear, pain, loss, and death. The stories are gifted as a compass that points to the need for us all to become healthy elders and good ancestors for all relations: to learn to live, to grieve, and to die well. This requires that we learn how to face our shadows, how to compost our “shit,” and how to weather storms together. For this to happen, we need a container where we can manifest unconditional regard for everyone’s being; while we commit to interrogating our thinking, our doing, our hopes and desires, and our ways of relating in order to breathe and to move together with maturity, sobriety, discernment, and accountability. This book is an attempt to create that container.

I do not claim to be able to do all these things or even to be able to teach others what to do. In fact, I would be suspicious of, and encourage others to be suspicious of, people who declare that they have the answers. The mess we find ourselves in is unprecedented and we all have a lot of work to do.

The Idea of Hospicing Modernity

If you can read this book, it is likely that modernity is like the air you breathe. You would not be able to access or read it without having acquired modernity’s literacies. Modernity is a single story of progress, development, human evolution, and civilization that is omnipresent. Modernity is full of paradoxes: of war and humanitarian support, of ongoing colonialism and reconciliation, of imperialism and education, of poverty creation and alleviation, of exponential growth and sustainability. Whether you and I identify with or are critical of it, it still conditions what and how we think, feel, desire, relate, hope, and imagine. Although modernity always sees itself and behaves as if “young,” it has grown old and is facing its end. Learning to offer palliative care to modernity dying within and around us is not something that modernity itself can teach us to do. In other words, most people will not willingly let go of the enjoyments and securities afforded by modernity: they will not voluntarily part with harmful habits of being that are extremely pleasurable. However, our collective unconscious knows that the enjoyments and securities promised by modernity cannot be endlessly sustained. This book is about preparing ourselves for coexisting differently whenever these enjoyments and securities may be taken away, whether this will happen in our lifetimes.

The first time I heard the word _hospice_ used as a verb was in Ireland in 2011, at an Occupy movement event. I had been invited to contribute to a conversation taking place outside the Central Bank of Ireland on Dame Street in Dublin. The word _hospice_ was introduced through the book _Walk Out, Walk On_ by Margaret Wheatley and Deborah Frieze.[^3] This word was used to refer to acting with compassion to assist systems to die with grace, and to support people in the process of letting go—even when they are holding on for dear life to what is already gone. Although the authors and I may have different perspectives about what is dying, why, and what needs to be let go of, I am very grateful for their work and for the gift of that word.

Since that encounter, the idea for a book about hospicing modernity visited me many times. I postponed it as much as I could, but as with all stubborn ideas, the book had its own agenda. It is important to note that, as the book will be received through your cultural and affective filters and will start to interact with your experiences, it will transform into something different altogether. Please understand that your interpretations are the result of different traveling stories intermingling and spinning together in a direction of their own that happens in your time and context—they may have very little resemblance to my own interpretations. This is fine as long as we are both aware that there may be significant differences between what I wrote and what you will interpret.

The book is organized in two parts: the first part (warm-up/prep work) creates a container for the second part (hospicing modernity). In part I you will be introduced to a thought experiment about our current social and ecological predicament (warm-up), you will become familiar with different understandings of modernity (prep work 1), you will be asked to carefully consider the implications of reading this book (prep work 2), and if you decide to continue reading, you will be offered seven basic tools that will give you a new language (frameworks, _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira, and strategies) to navigate the rest of the book (prep work 3). In part II, you will find ten chapters addressing themes related to modernity dying, and what would be necessary to hospice it and assist with the birth of something new—without suffocating the “baby.” These chapters are collections of stories and exercises that invite you to sit with our collective shadows and “shit” and to stay with the storm, stay with the trouble.[^4] These chapters articulate some of modernity’s wrongs and the implications of facing these wrongs for different forms of social activism. These chapters offer insights on how to gradually part with habits of living that are harmful to yourself, to other human and nonhuman beings, and to the metabolic movements of the planet at large. Although the chapters are organized sequentially, each chapter is an independent bundle of stories and exercises that stands on its own. Thus, the chapters in part II could, in theory, be read in any order. However, I do not recommend reading the chapters in part II without going through part I first.

Since this book is about expanding our collective capacity to hold space for difficult and painful things, I cannot say, “I hope you enjoy this book.” There will be parts of it that you won’t enjoy, and at some points perhaps you will even be angry at me. If you need to process what you are going through, the GTDF collective has created a peer support pathway you are welcome to use at decolonialfutures.net/hospicingmodernity]]. What I wish for is for you to learn to feel comfortable with the nausea and discomfort of difficult learning as soon as possible. Then, I promise you, it will be much easier to enjoy the ride.

The Gifts of Paradoxes

I titled this preface “My Grandmothers’ Gifts,” in loving memory of my grandmothers, vó Vitória and vó Vitalina. They were both tremendously courageous, contradictory, stubborn women living complex lives in their historical contexts. Vó Vitória was a victim of political, sexual, and gender (forced marriage) violence who kept the photo of her sweetheart (whom she met at fourteen and was not allowed to date) hidden in her wallet until the day she died at eighty-four years old. She also reproduced gender violence toward my aunts and firmly believed in the superiority of white people over nonwhite people until close to her death. She gave my mother and other racialized people who joined the family a very hard time, yet despite my skin color being different from hers, she showed me only unconditional love and always had my back. Vó Vitalina was a victim of colonial, racial, gender, class, and sexual violence and her politics was one of unfaltering refusal to submit to modernity—regardless of the costs of that refusal, including her becoming homeless. As much as I want to romanticize her resistance, I know that—despite having been a victim of multiple forms of historical and systemic violence—she was not immune to reproducing it herself.

Within modernity we are encouraged to idealize humanity and to look for faultless virtuous role models. However, my grandmothers’ gifts were crafted and offered mostly through their mistakes, their paradoxes, and the complexities of their lives. From vó Vitória, who was a seamstress, I inherited determination, endurance, and confidence to cross borders and to work through whatever life presented me (including becoming a teenage mum and writing in order to cope with and survive racism at the university). From vó Vitalina, who was a _benzedeira_ (healer), I inherited intuition, free-spiritedness, and an unbounded source of vitality (the translation of her name). She also instilled in me the insight that the sense of separation and superiority implanted by modernity is a social disease in all of us, that requires collective healing. This commitment to healing is the reason I dropped out of school and later became a teacher aspiring (rather naively) to redirect education away from the reproduction of harm.

The multiple forms of violence my grandmothers faced—and reproduced—in their lifetime have not disappeared, far from it. But hopefully, one day, the integration of the lessons of our collective failure to interrupt violence will become part of what reframes how we approach our human predicament. Although my grandmothers are not physically around anymore, they make themselves present in every aspect of my life as I process and integrate their teachings. They whisper persistently and sometimes annoyingly as I try to work. They both insist on asking, “What if?”

What If?

What if racism, colonialism, and all other forms of toxic, contagious divisions are preventable social diseases?

What if the texts, education, and forms of organization we revere have carried and spread the disease, but also contain latent parts of the medicine that can heal it?

What if learning to activate this medicine requires coming to terms with our violent histories (as painful as that may be); learning to see the world through the eyes of others (as impossible as that sounds); and facing humanity (in our own selves first) in its full complexity, affliction, and imperfection?

What if the purging prompted by this medicine leads us to confront our traumas and learn to let go of fears of scarcity, loneliness, worthlessness, guilt, and shame?

What if we must learn to trust each other without guarantees?

What if the motivation to survive alongside one another in a finite planet in dynamic balance (without written agreements, coercive enforcements, or assurances) will come through being taught collectively by the disease itself?

What if collective healing will be made possible precisely by facing—together—the end of the world as we know it?

Warm-up: Into the Future

In August 2020 I was invited to present a paper on the topic of what schools could look like in 2048. This was for a conference in Germany on utopian visions. Since education is much broader than schooling, I found that it was problematic to assume that education in 2048 would still happen through schools. I accepted the invitation, proposing instead to engage conference participants in a different kind of future-focused activity than the one the conference organizers had imagined. I collaborated with the GTDF collective on designing and presenting at the conference a thought experiment called Education 2048. Since then, we have tried the experiment with several groups and started to map common responses to it. I will use this experiment to give a sense of what this book is about and why it might (or might not) be relevant in your context.

There are two parts to this experiment. In the first part, you are invited to imagine a specific scenario; in the second part, you are invited to consider two sets of questions. The scenario places you on December 10, 2048—one hundred years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. You are in a 3D virtual reality world conference call where people across the globe have gathered to decide the direction of education after a period of catastrophic events. These events occurred as a result of irresponsible human choices, followed by a period during which humanity managed to learn from the consequences of their actions and to coexist in wiser and healthier ways. In the second part of the experiment, you are invited to consider questions about the scenario and questions related to your affective responses to the experiment itself.

It is very important to mention that this thought experiment is not trying to impart content or offer a specific idea of the way forward that we all should agree with. The exercise is neither descriptive nor prescriptive; instead it intends to clear space and build collective capacity for us to reflect on the role of education in confronting the potential or likelihood of social and ecological collapse in our lifetimes—and beyond.

The experiment invites you to take a step back from your own opinions and expectations to observe what is going on in relation to your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations. Try to observe the parts of you desiring to relate to this exercise through logic (focusing on the accuracy of descriptions and feasibility of prescriptions presented), the parts of you desiring to relate to the experiment through creativity (focusing on the artistic license and movement of the metaphors), the parts of you wanting to relate to the experiment through the body (focusing on physical sensations and affective responses), and the parts of you experiencing the exercise as a mixture of these modes of relating or others that may emerge. Witness your responses with curiosity, without investing emotionally in reactions or resistance that may emerge toward the exercise.

World Conference Call, December 10, 2048

Imagine today is December 10, 2048, and you are participating in a 3D virtual reality world conference call aimed at deciding how we should educate our children and ourselves after the devastating impact of the events of the past thirty years. These events were caused by human greed, arrogance, stubbornness, and unwillingness to learn from wrongs, failures, and mistakes. For our consultation, we should remember: a) what education is for, b) what the past has taught us, c) what made a difference in getting us out of the mess, d) what we know now, and e) what we are still being taught. We will review these together before starting our consultation. There are one billion people on this call, a third of today’s total world population. We will start by recalling significant events that happened in the last three decades. What you will see next is just the text of this presentation; the associated _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira and videos are now being transferred to your body implants—please blink twice to accept the files.

### Period between 2018 and 2027

The period between 2018 and 2027 was marked by an interruption of our dreams of consumerism-as-prosperity. This period started with school climate strikes, when young people became aware that our chosen path was both violent and unsustainable. They already knew that their generation would not have the same opportunities for social mobility that their parents and grandparents may have enjoyed, or the stability and well-being afforded by their class in relatively healthy ecosystems. In 2020 the COVID-19 global pandemic hit, followed by several outbreaks of different strains of the virus. Racial tensions and civil unrest also marked this period, especially in highly divided and volatile countries like Brazil, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

From 2022 we had a mounting economic crisis, mass unemployment and homelessness, mass migration, localized famines, and the intensification of social and racial inequalities. Reactionary populist governments were democratically elected all over the world, by harnessing the power of hyperpolitical polarization and fueling antagonism and resentment. Extreme weather, flooding, and catastrophic forest fires became routine. Pollinator populations collapsed globally in 2026. In 2019 we thought we had found a silver lining to all this as we celebrated our collective efforts when we registered the smallest size on record of the hole in the ozone layer; but in 2020, the hole appeared deeper and larger than when it was first discovered. For a few months that same year, carbon emissions noticeably dropped in places where coronavirus lockdowns were observed. At the beginning of the pandemic there was much excitement and hope that people’s attitudes toward fossil fuel travel had changed forever, but soon emissions soared again. By 2027, alpine skiing was only possible in the Himalayas.

In this ten-year period, schools became even more obvious sites of political and economic struggle. Governments in many countries, including the US and the UK, forbade teachers from talking about racial privilege or the complexities of gender and sexual identities. Teachers were also prohibited from presenting anticapitalist perspectives or perspectives challenging accounts of history authorized by the state. However, despite political disputes, the protection of unrealistic economic interests was still prioritized in the curriculum: at large, schools were still teaching a learner-centered, competency-based, technology- and market-oriented curriculum driven by hyperindividualistic metropolitan consumerist values and principles.

By this time, curriculum, examination, and school social services had largely been outsourced to private companies. In 2026 a well-known US corporation that for decades had lobbied governments around the world offered a more cost-effective option for online global education and teacher training. They standardized a global curriculum powered by artificial intelligence, causing mass teacher unemployment. They saved trillions in tax dollars but could not reinvest in social services because the funds had to be allocated to offset the historic level of debt created by the coronavirus stimulus packages. This shift in capital created the single greatest increase in wealth inequality in historical records, with the top 0.01% amassing the equivalent net worth of 90% of the world’s population.

### Period between and 2037

The period between and 2037 was marked by the real threat of human extinction. By the Amazon forest was down to a third of its size; the remainder teetered on the edge of becoming a biologically inert desert, similar to the US’s exhausted agricultural corn belt fields. Ironically, the market share of Jeff Bezos’s Amazon corporation was worth a third of the total global wealth. The average temperature rose 2.47 degrees Celsius across the globe, as previous mitigation efforts had proved too little too late. All the ice in the Arctic Ocean melted. Children read about polar bears and many other arctic species in the new histories of extinction; sad companions to the _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira and stories of mammoths, sabertooth tigers, and giant land sloths that filled children’s books in the late twentieth century.

All of Siberia’s permafrost melted, releasing methane and unleashing viruses and fungal strains that we were neither immune to nor prepared for. Extensive desertification led to massive crop failures that, in turn, caused the global food supply chain to break down. This resulted in the worst global famine ever experienced. Disastrous typhoons, hurricanes, and tsunamis also made large areas uninhabitable. Countless people were displaced. Borders were closed and militarized due to mass migration. Most states failed to sustain their welfare safety net—leaving many people without government support for healthcare, sanitation, or waste management. Pensions and unemployment benefits also became a thing of the past as systems of wage labor foundered, and mid-human-range future forecasting became impossible. Reactionary dictatorships took power. Governments used mass surveillance and AI technology, wrapped in the rhetoric of “maintaining law and order,” to sweep away civil rights and freedoms and control citizen mobility. Torture and genocide against people and groups deemed inconvenient increased at an alarming rate and became a normalized extension of police and military tactics. Nuclear and biological weapons were unleashed in wars.

Five factors contributed to unparalleled loss of human life during this time: 1) unprecedented famine; 2) major viral and fungal outbreaks; 3) a global mental health crisis; 4) incurable new diseases caused by combined toxins and microplastics in food and water; and 5) violent civil conflicts—including state-sanctioned violence, terrorism, and police brutality. Needless to say, Black, Indigenous, and racialized populations were disproportionately targeted by state-sponsored violence and suffered the most in these events due to unparalleled levels of inequality. It is important to acknowledge that many of these communities had been experiencing these levels of trauma for generations, and had been sounding the alarm for ages, but most of us were indifferent and focused on trying to sustain our way of life in spite of all evidence that it was deadly.

Online schooling became unviable in 2033, and the corporation that had taken over global online learning went bankrupt in 2034—although the C-suite executives received generous payouts, bonuses, and severance packages prior to dissolution. The global economy completely collapsed in 2036, a year after Elon Musk started a human colony on Mars.

### Period between 2038 and 2047

In the period between 2038 and 2047, we finally accepted that we were part of the problem and needed to engage with our painful reality to avoid being wiped out. The Mars colony tragically failed in 2038, destroying our hopes for life on another planet. In 2039, a massive event made us all suddenly recognize the enormous cost of our mistakes. Finally we could see that we were addicted to arrogance, consumption, and unaccountable autonomy. We realized that we needed mass rehabilitation. We grasped the gravity of the fact that we were only three billion people left on the planet. We understood that we had caused the extinction of 70% of _all species_—and the extinction of _all life_ in entire regions of the earth—and we were extremely close to causing our own. We recognized that planet Earth is alive and we are part of its metabolism, not the center of the world or a special species. We also worked out that humanity is capable of both horrendous and wonderful things. We started to face our own and others’ humanity in all its complexity; and be taught by the human wrongs we had inflicted upon each other, upon other beings, and upon the planet.

Then we all had to learn quickly, collectively, and without schools or moral manifestos:

- to heal intellectually, emotionally, relationally, economically, ecologically, and politically;
- to abolish colonial and racial violence, inequality, hierarchies of worth and separations;
- to center the earth and decenter our egos, identities, human narratives, and projections;
- to age and to die in generative ways;
- to care for, rather than compete with, everything and everyone;
- to plant, repurpose technology, compost, repair, and regenerate everything;
- to prioritize the common good for humans, nonhumans, and the planet;
- to use words and conversation carefully and wisely, with humility and maturity;
- to own up, sober up, clean up, grow up, show up, and exist differently.

So today, December 10, 2048, we convene to decide how to educate our children for human responsibility, considering the needs of the next seven generations of humans and nonhumans alike. We need our children to learn from human wrongs—from the violence and unsustainability caused by humanity, from our repeated mistakes of the past—so they can only make different mistakes in their future. From the day children are born, their education should prepare them to become healthy, wise elders and good ancestors for all relations. We cannot afford to repeat history. Today we decide how to do this together, as a planet-wide human and nonhuman family.

This is the end of the scenario. In the second part of this thought experiment, you are invited to engage with two sets of questions: “dipping-in” questions that invite you to engage with the scenario itself, and “diving deeper” questions that invite you to observe your own engagement with the scenario.

Dipping-in Questions

1. What do you think was the event that made us realize we needed to find another way to (co)exist?
2. Recall a memorable moment in your own process of realization. What sensations are in your body? What did you grieve losing the most? What was the rehab process like—for you and those around you? What did it entail? Was it painful? Uncomfortable? Difficult? What are you most grateful to have experienced?
3. What motivated us to keep going on an unsustainable and violent path until 2039? How were policies, technologies, and market economies used to support violence and unsustainability?
4. How were you complicit in the harm inflicted on others and on the planet in this period?
5. What do you remember wanting most during that time? What sensations can you feel in your body when you recall this desire?
6. What motivated us to seek a different path after 2039? What healthier, wiser forms of organization and economies emerged? How was technology used to support a different form of (co)existence? How were your own needs, dreams, and desires changed?
7. Who were the people who survived? Who perished? Why?
8. Did you know the answer to the question above? How did you come to know?
9. What did we fail to learn before 2018 that could have prevented the most harmful events of the two decades that followed?
10. Knowing what you know in 2048, if you could go back to 2021 what advice would you give to the people about to face the events that unfolded? After giving general advice, choose one person and craft a special message for them.

Diving Deeper Questions

1. What affective responses emerged during this exercise? Anxiety? Sadness? Resistance? Relief? Exhaustion? Excitement? Hope? Hopelessness? Anger? Frustration? Defensiveness? Loss? Grief?
2. Did you manage to observe these responses without trying to interpret them and without investing emotionally?
3. The collapse described in the scenario has already happened for many people and other species. In many cases, the “collapse” they face on a daily basis is what maintains the comforts, enjoyments, securities, and conveniences of those of us thus far protected from it. How do you relate to your own complicity in violence and unsustainability? How does your body respond when you reflect on this?
4. How did your body respond to the portrayal of humanity as arrogant, stubborn, and unwilling to learn? Who would likely see humanity from this perspective? Did you witness a desire for humanity to be portrayed only as beautiful, brave, wise, loving, and kind? Do you hope that alternative leaders, groups, or movements will have the answers to our predicament? What could these desires and forms of hope prevent us from acknowledging, addressing, and experiencing?
5. Did you witness a desire for hope in the continuity of our current system and reassurance that everything would be okay? Who do you think could characterize this desire as a form of self-infantilization or as a form of harm?
6. To what extent are you able to hold space for the aspects of yourself that you or other people would not consider pretty? How much time and energy do you invest in seeking or demanding validation for your knowledge, work, or positive self-image? Why is this important? What do you (and others) gain or lose with this? What insecurities could be driving this behavioral pattern? What sensations have arisen in your body when engaging with these questions?
7. How prepared are you to hold space for difficult (painful, overwhelming, irritating) issues and conversations without wanting to be rescued/coddled or demanding quick fixes? How can you expand this capacity? From whom or what might you need to learn to do that?
8. What affective work do you think will be necessary for people to choose a path of relational maturity, sobriety, humility, discernment, and accountability in which we can face storms together without hurting (or killing) each other or further harming (or fully destroying) the planet and other nonhuman beings? What do you feel is necessary now for this to start to happen?
9. Were there parts of you that felt relieved by having these topics on the table? Were there parts of you that were concerned about exposing others to these topics? What desires and assumptions are behind both responses?
10. What realizations (if any) have you had with this exercise?

As members of my research collective presented this experiment in different educational contexts, we observed and mapped four interesting clusters of responses:

_The first cluster_ of responses was characterized by relief that the experiment addressed frustrations arising from the fact that these topics are rarely addressed in education. Responses in this cluster expressed relief (that the catastrophic unfolding of events was named), anger (at our collective inability to see this already happening), excitement (that we are finally talking about it), and skepticism (related to the awakening presented as a conclusion).

_The second cluster_ was characterized by initial frustration followed by hope: frustration with the description of events, but hope about their conclusion. Responses in this cluster reflected surprise (at the exercise), anxiety (about the unfolding catastrophe), hope (about the conclusion), and concern (for the length of time it could take to find solutions).

_The third cluster_ was characterized by immobilization: responses indicated that the experiment had pushed people into zones of panic or immobilization. Responses in this cluster reflected resistance (to the exercise), opposition (to the existence of the exercise), fear (of hopelessness caused by the exercise), despair (with the scenario), overwhelm (from the complexity of the situation), and denial (of complicity in the problems presented).

_The fourth cluster_ was characterized by signs of rearranging desires. Responses in this cluster reflected bewilderment (at the scale of the problem), disorientation and disidentification with one’s own priorities (loss of satisfaction with familiar cognitive/affective frameworks), unease with leaving this exercise open, motivation to keep working through complexities, but feeling ill-equipped to take next steps, and feelings described as “open heart surgery” and “lead ball in the stomach.”[^1]

## Exercise

How would you map your responses in relation to the clusters presented? Did you notice patterns of response that did not fit in this map of clusters? What would be necessary to happen for sober and mature conversations about the potential or likelihood of collapse to start happening in generative ways in your context or in society in general?

This book consists of two parts:

In the first part (prep work) you will be invited to reflect on who modernity is and whether it is time (or not) for you to hospice it. For those who sense modernity dying within and around them, this book offers a new vocabulary and strategies that could make their lives much easier. However, for those who are protective of modernity and not ready to entertain the idea of its demise, reading this book could be disturbing and not advisable.

In the second part (hospicing modernity), you will find a collection of ten chapters, each with its own bundle of stories and exercises. The chapters can be read sequentially or not. I must tell you that this is not a “regular” book. It is a book of practice—a book of spells, if you will. Be mindful how you use it.

  

# Prep Work 1  
Who the Heck Is Modernity?

We are living off expired or expiring stories. Stories that expire can no longer dance with you. They are lethargic or stuck, they can’t move things in generative ways anymore, but we often feel we cannot let them go. Many of these expired stories give us a sense of security, purpose, and direction—precisely because they seem stable and solid. Thus, we become attached to them and get used to their weight in our lives. If we notice they are dying, we refuse to accept it and we put them on life support because we fear the void left in their place when they are no longer there. We forecast that this void will leave us empty, story-less, and that there will be no vitality in this emptiness because everything will be meaningless, pointless, purposeless, and sad.

We don’t realize that when stories expire, their vitality is already gone; and if their vitality is gone we are also stuck, because our vitality comes partly from stories moving things in the world and within us. If we want to get unstuck, we need to put these expired stories to rest. But before that happens we need to prepare to receive their final teachings, which are the deepest, gloomiest, and sometimes also the funniest. The next step is to figure out a way to release these stories, and—for at least a minute—to sit with the mystery of the void we feared. This is where we might discover that our forecast was wrong. We might find that the void consists of both nothingness and everything-ness and that it can be an unlimited source of serenity, sanity, energy, and inspiration. The last thing is to step back into the world of stories and to look for the ones (both old and new) that are already dancing or getting ready to dance, and that can move us toward the healing and well-being of everyone and everything. Eventually—whether slowly or quickly—these stories will also expire, and the cycle will start again.

For this book, I have tried to choose the stories with the most vitality and potential to teach us some new dance moves. These stories might help us put expired stories to rest; and to sense, relate, and imagine otherwise.

In this chapter you will be introduced to different definitions of modernity. The only thing certain about modernity is that it is a contested phenomenon with multiple definitions. The way modernity is addressed in this book is somewhat unconventional: modernity is a “who” rather than a “what”—it is presented as a multifaceted, living entity. In this sense, modernity is not a concept, label, or object of analysis. Rather, it is a worlding story, a complex adaptive living system that actively does things, including conditioning the habits of knowing and being of those whose lives and livelihoods are intertwined with it.

I have tried to map the dynamic play of stories about modernity that circulate in academic contexts. Some of the stories defend and others critique modernity. I introduce the term _modernity/coloniality_ and also draw attention to some peculiar characteristics of modernity.

Contested Definitions

In academia there are many competing stories about modernity from different disciplines, angles, perspectives, and agendas.[^1] The general overview I present here maps the difference between these stories in terms of where people think modernity comes from, why they think modernity is here, what modernity has given us, and what is at stake when modernity dies.

One of the most contested things about modernity is its origins. In many stories, modernity is presented as emerging in response to the authority and rule of the Church in Europe in medieval times. Other stories present modernity as a historical period that began with the Renaissance in the seventeenth century or the European Enlightenment in the eighteenth century. Some stories present it as starting in the late fifteenth century with the colonization of what is known today as the Americas, and the initiation of the transatlantic slave trade. There are even stories that root modernity’s original seedlings in antiquity, in Greek philosophy.[^2]

Two other important contested issues are modernity’s intentions and legitimacy. One widespread story presents modernity as a general project of civilization that seeks to engineer society through humanism, reason, science, progress, and technology. There are stories that present it as a particularly Western project of civilization that has achieved nearly universal reach because of its merits. Other stories describe modernity as a local European design that has been imposed globally through explicit and subtle violence.[^3] Still other stories present modernity as a project that has been resisted, transformed, and redesigned by different cultures.[^4] Other stories speak of multiple modernities, focusing on how the Western project of modernity has taken different forms in different contexts where it was imposed and internalized.[^5] Stories of post-modernity follow similar patterns of diversity.[^6]

It is also important to note that most stories written about modernity defend modernity as the greatest achievement of humanity and the best of all possible worlds.[^7] Other stories see it as an expression of humanity’s capacity to simultaneously manifest extraordinary and terrible things, arguing that other worlds are possible.[^8] In these stories, many who benefit from modernity would be prepared to fight to secure its continuity. Many of those who are exploited by modernity would prefer to benefit from it, regardless of the costs. Many would like to see modernity replaced by a different system. Some of those believe modernity is stuck in self-infantilizing behavior; some see it recklessly crossing several tipping points leading to its decline; others see it as approaching or already past its expiration date. Some believe a genuinely new system is only possible if we are able to learn the lessons that modernity has to offer in its decline.[^9]

This book resonates with this latter position. Its intention is not to provide a synthesis of stories already told, but to offer different stories that can help us take a step back. This allows us to develop the dispositions to be taught by modernity itself—with honesty about its flaws and gifts—without trying to defend it, fix it, or prematurely replace it. In this sense, modernity is not a corrupt project of the West that needs to be defeated and replaced with a more righteous and virtuous non-Western alternative, but rather something that is now (unevenly) part of all of us, conditioning the ways we experience reality.

The educational stories of modernity presented here do not seek to put modernity in a box as an object, or to describe it objectively and universally, or to prescribe what exactly you should do with it. Instead, the stories seek to move us to experience and observe manifestations of modernity and ourselves within it differently, with more sobriety, maturity, discernment, and accountability. This is crucial if we want to repair relations and make better-informed and more responsible choices as we face the storms ahead of us with more humility, honesty, humor, and hyper–self-reflexivity.

Modernity/Coloniality

In my academic writing—which is a rather restrictive mode of communication—I have often referred to modernity as _modernity/coloniality._[^10] This term functions as a reminder that the benefits we associate with modernity are created and maintained by historical, systemic, and ongoing processes that are inherently violent and unsustainable. In other words, this term underscores the fact that modernity cannot exist without expropriation, extraction, exploitation, militarization, dispossession, destitution, genocides, and ecocides. This is substantiated by economic, political, and historical data, but, like climate crisis data, this data is deemed “too hard to deal with,” and largely ignored or reframed as something else. For example, in many stories of modernity these effects are considered the collateral damage of modernity rather than the necessary preconditions for modernity to exist.

One hell of a trick of modernity/coloniality is making itself appear benevolently omnipresent, while rendering its violence and unsustainability invisible. In the global north the stage is set to uphold the virtues of modernity, thus critics of modernity, especially from the global south, are often framed as not knowing what they are talking about. It feels like one is always being asked: “How can’t you see that modernity is the greatest thing that has happened since sliced bread?” To interrupt this ingrained assumption of greatness and benevolence, the term _modernity/coloniality_ was created to underscore the fact that violence and unsustainability are necessary for modernity to exist.

The term has a Latin American origin and builds on a distinction between colonialism and coloniality proposed by Aníbal Quijano.[^11] While _colonialism_ is often presented as the formal occupation and administration of lands and the subjugation of the original peoples of these lands, _coloniality_ refers to the enduring manifestations of colonial relations, logic, and situations—even after the official decolonization of formal structures of governance. In this sense, coloniality represents a global hegemonic form of power that organizes bodies, time, knowledge, relationships, labor, and space according to economic parameters (i.e., exchange value) and to the benefit of particular groups of people, with or without formal colonization.

_Modernity/coloniality_ imposes a mode of representation that claims both benevolence and universality for itself, while denying its violence and unsustainability. However, both colonialism and coloniality are constitutive of, and inseparable from, modernity:[^12] they are two sides of the same coin.[^13] Colonialism and coloniality were necessary for the creation of modernity—they are necessary for its preservation and they will be necessary for its expansion. The term also draws attention to the fact that conquest is the driving force of modernity/coloniality: the colonial desires to “discover,” to conquer, occupy, own, rule, and control propel modernity “forward.”[^14] I will use the term _modernity/coloniality_ only in this chapter as a reminder of modernity’s origins, consequences, and costs.

Humans versus “Nature”

While most critics of modernity/coloniality associate colonialism with the expansionist occupation of lands and the subjugation of peoples, many Indigenous peoples see these manifestations of violence as symptoms of a deeper and older form of violence that happens at ontological and metaphysical realms—the realm of “being.”[^15] This deeper, older violence is the imposed sense of separation between ourselves and the dynamic living land-metabolism that is the planet and beyond, as well as the theological separation between creature and creator. This imposed sense of separation, or separability,[^16] is based on human exceptionalism, the idea that humans are a superior species that deserve to conquer, dominate, own, manage, and control the natural environment.

Human exceptionalism is also the basis of anthropocentrism, which places humans at the center of, and as the most important entities in, the world. Human exceptionalism and anthropocentrism have often been justified on the grounds of the human capacity to reason, understood as the capacity to consciously make sense of reality and to apply logic in order to adapt and justify decisions.

The idea of separability is older than that of modernity itself. Some locate its origins in Abrahamic traditions that present a human-like male Godhead entity gifting nature to worthy chosen humans as a resource to be managed. Others focus on how it manifested in Greece, when Greek philosophy moved from oral traditions to the technology of writing, replacing contextual knowledge with a quest for universal meanings defined and documented by particular humans (i.e., logocentrism).[^17] This technological shift contributed to the perception that the trees and the land could no longer teach us anything of value and that human progress is to be found in cities. This is illustrated by a passage in one of the Platonic dialogues, _Phaedrus,_ where Plato documents Socrates’s words: “I’m a lover of learning, and trees and open country won’t teach me anything, whereas men in the town do.”[^18] In this sense, separability is a project of emancipation or liberation from “nature” that is carried forward by modernity/coloniality. The triad of human exceptionalism, anthropocentrism, and logocentrism that characterizes separability is the basis of the different forms of narcissism of the human species that manifest in different ways in the various phases and contexts of modernity/coloniality.

In addition to naturalizing separations and hierarchies between humans and nature, modernity/coloniality also produces separations and hierarchies _within_ humanity. For instance, the capacity to reason in a legitimate way, or at all, is attributed to particular human bodies and particular cultures. This is the source of hierarchies where the worth of bodies and cultures is tied to their perceived ability to produce knowledge in a specific way. The capacity (attributed to certain bodies) to produce knowledge of universal worth has historically been used to justify cultural and gendered supremacy and to rationalize the occupation of lands and the racial subjugation and enslavement of peoples. Cultural supremacy secures a position where certain bodies are perceived to naturally embody authority and to be the legitimate arbiters of justice who are best fit to impose on other bodies what they believe to be objective and universal parameters and protocols for morality, ethics, economy, politics, and science.

Indexing the World into Words

If the primary orienting project of modernity/coloniality is to control and engineer reality through objective unequivocal knowing, this process can only happen through fixed categories of meaning. Knowledge production in this context focuses on certainties, objective descriptions, and moralizing prescriptions. This reflects a desire to index the totality of the reality of the world in unambiguous language that can describe it objectively. This is like putting everything in the world in boxes that can be labeled, categorized, and described accurately in an encyclopedia, forever captured in alphabetic writing in a fixed and perfect form. The next step is to create a powerful tower of knowledge made of brick-like encyclopedias that can stand the test of time and also represent a particular culture’s achievement, greatness, and legacy over centuries. I refer to this as “wording the world.” Wording the world drives the privileging of meaning within modernity/coloniality. We search for the meaning of life. We value things that are meaning-_full,_ we ignore things that we perceive to be meaning-_less._ This obsession with meaning overrides other sensibilities to the point where we can only register what we consider meaning-full, and we may numb to sense-fullness (in the broadest, most sensorial sense).

Modernity/coloniality has the capacity to imprint the wording of the world as the only possible relationship with language, meaning, knowledge—and, consequentially, with the world. It also imposes its own meanings as neutral and objective representations of reality. This power to define reality is inseparable from colonial power and the multiple forms of violence of colonialism and coloniality. Many critics of modernity/coloniality use the term _epistemic_ or _cognitive imperialism_[^19] to refer to this imposition, while the term _epistemicide,_ coined by Boaventura de Sousa Santos,[^20] is used to refer to the delegitimization and elimination of ways of knowing and being that deviate from the imposed norm.

However, very few critics of modernity/coloniality explore the implications of the colonization of our relationship with language itself—the wording of the world. Within modernity/coloniality, being is defined by reason and it is the certainty of knowing (through description/prescription) that anchors the security of being. Most critics of modernity overlook the implications of this ontological trait (and trap!). The result is that alternative worldviews to modernity are presented as ways of describing reality that mimic the process of wording the world of modernity. Thus, as Cash Ahenakew[^21] argues, other cultures’ epistemologies are cut from their ontological roots and grafted onto the modern/colonial ontology in the process of translation. This restrictive pattern of translation makes it impossible to communicate a relationship with language that is not about describing or constructing reality. I have observed it at work when Indigenous colleagues talk about “the earth as a living entity” and are met with someone referring to this as “the Indigenous _concept_ of the earth as a living entity”—to which they respond, “This is not a concept!” This is hard to explain because we expect our explanations to word the world so that we can understand it with the terms we have inherited from modernity/coloniality. We consider these terms to be correct and universal, because we cannot imagine otherwise. This is one of the ways modernity/coloniality constrains our thinking and imagination—and does so in a way that is faster than thinking or imagination.

Constitutive Denials

In the story of modernity as a wording of the world, what modernity/coloniality disavows can be thought of as constitutive denials: what we need to (be made to) forget in order to believe what modernity/coloniality wants us to believe in, and to desire what modernity/coloniality wants us to desire. There are at least four main constitutive denials sanctioned within modernity/coloniality that severely restrict our capacity to sense, relate, and imagine otherwise:[^22]

1. the denial of systemic, historical, and ongoing violence and of complicity in harm (the fact that our comforts, securities, and enjoyments are subsidized by expropriation and exploitation elsewhere);
2. the denial of the limits of the planet and of the unsustainability of modernity/coloniality (the fact that the finite earth-metabolism cannot sustain exponential growth, consumption, extraction, exploitation, and expropriation indefinitely);
3. the denial of entanglement (our insistence in seeing ourselves as separate from each other and the land, rather than “entangled” within a wider living metabolism that is bio-intelligent); and
4. the denial of the magnitude and complexity of the problems we need to face together (the tendency to look for simplistic solutions that make us feel and look good and that may address symptoms, but not the root causes, of our collective complex predicament).

Confronting and wrestling with these denials are part and parcel of the invitation to hospice modernity; therefore, you will see this set of denials popping up in different chapters of this book.

## Exercise

Which of these denials is the strongest in your context of work? Amongst your family and friends? Which of these denials do you feel most prepared to confront at this moment? Which do you think is the most challenging denial for you, and why?

Academic Critiques

Academia as we know it today (and formal education in general) has been created to uphold modernity, to recruit supporters, and to secure modernity’s future. In order for this to happen, academia must reproduce the denials presented earlier. This is tricky because it actually requires safeguarding spaces where modernity can be critiqued without this critique greatly affecting modernity itself. This fits well with modernity’s self-image as a critical project that has challenged the power of the Church and established the supremacy of critical reasoning over faith and superstition. Therefore, modernity tends to accommodate the circulation of critiques as long as the critiques do not have purchase.[^23] In other words, while modernity/coloniality rewards the dissemination of narratives related to its greatness, benefits, and achievements, it tolerates only critiques of modernity that are inconsequential in practice.[^24] Those who succeed in making modernity’s violence and unsustainability real in people’s awareness and lived experience are themselves perceived to create or to become problems.[^25]

In addition, debates about modernity get stuck in academia because the terms of the debate themselves are defined by—guess who? Let me illustrate this with an analogy. Imagine a theater lit outside by a bright neon sign with the word _Modernity._ Inside are a well-illuminated elevated stage and also poorly lit rows of chairs for the audience to watch the performance. The stage is taken up by those who defend the shiny side of modernity associated with seamless progress, industrialization, secularization, humanism, individualism, scientific reasoning, and nation-states. In the nonilluminated audience space, there are many people—including those who enjoy and applaud what is happening on the stage and those frustrated with the performance who want to expose the shadow side of modernity associated with colonialism, imperialism, slavery, militarization, genocides, and ecocides.

There are some people with entrenched positions onstage and in the audience who embrace or reject modernity wholesale and who are extremely defensive of their position. There are also those with a spectrum of more nuanced perspectives. Some onstage may believe that modernity is problematic to different degrees, but defend that modernity is still viable: it just needs to be fixed and completed as a project of civilization. For them, critique is imperative since they believe that modernity’s problems can be fixed with more modernity. They may call some—generally prescreened—audience members to the stage to voice their position, as long as they promise to return to their seats promptly so the play can continue as planned. Others in the audience may believe that modernity as a Western project is not viable in the long term, but that many of its outcomes are defensible. In other words, some problems of modernity can be alleviated with more modernity, at least in the short term, but others can’t. However, as the play unfolds according to its written script, people in the theater get absorbed by their experience of enjoying or rejecting it, and what happens outside or around the theater is erased and forgotten. The theater becomes the entire world for those trapped inside of it. That, for me, sums up what generally happens in academia and in modernity.

Modernity Is Faster than Thought

Modernity predetermines what can be heard; what can be deemed real and possible; what can be imagined as desirable and ideal; and how we are supposed to feel, behave, and communicate within these parameters. This conditioning is precognitive—it is faster than thought itself as it structures our unconscious. But don’t take my word for it; let’s try an experiment. Sharon Stein created an exercise called CIRCULAR that identifies eight expected intellectual, affective, and performative dispositional patterns that modernity has imprinted in our unconscious and that it rewards. (See table 1, below.) These patterns may prevent us from sensing, relating, and imagining otherwise, but since they are perceived as normal and natural, there is virtually no incentive to notice them or to interrupt them. In fact, for you to be functional and intelligible within modernity, you have to use them.

Within modernity’s framework of legibility, it is difficult to invite people to see the problems with these patterns. That is because generally, in order to get people’s attention, we must present problematic patterns as obstacles to modernity’s progress. However, when we do this, there is a tendency to respond by trying to transcend these patterns in search of moral purity, political authority, or (collective or individual) advancement—each of which is deeply rooted in modernity’s frames. That is not what this exercise is about. If we try to mobilize interest in noticing and interrupting these patterns in this way, that would defeat the entire purpose of this exercise. Instead, you are invited to view the difficulties of confronting these patterns as teachers that can show us something very important (about modernity and about ourselves) that we generally would rather deny.

---

## Exercise

The exercise invites you to do three things:

1. Spot these patterns as they pop up unannounced in your responses to this text and to things going on in your life during the next seven days. You can also spot them around you, in the responses of others. You could create a bingo game with the patterns as well—lighten it up; otherwise you risk using this exercise for virtue-signaling.
2. Observe the reward mechanisms that exist for these patterns, and how you and other people derive pleasure and satisfaction from them. Reflect on the depth of the challenge of trying to change these patterns in a whole culture (but don’t despair).
3. As you spot and observe, you are invited to sit with what is in front of you, with self-compassion, without praising or condemning, without investing or trying to solve it as a problem. The idea is for you to build stamina to hold space for difficult and painful things without feeling overwhelmed, immobilized, or wanting to be rescued from the discomfort (e.g., by focusing on solutions, or seeking affirmation or innocence).

The intention is not to use this exercise to overcome these patterns or to establish a moral high ground—actually, quite the opposite. This exercise is about expanding capacity for the “4 Hs”: humility, honesty, humor, and hyper–self-reflexivity. This gives you a glimpse of the work of hospicing modernity that the rest of this book will invite you to do.

This chapter is prep work for hospicing modernity. Like training for a marathon, this process requires us to use muscles that most of us have neglected—and in some cases, that we don’t even know we have. The next chapter continues the prep work. It will give you an idea of the types of stories you will find in the rest of the book, and the profile of those who will benefit the most from reading them. It will also ask you to make an informed decision about whether you should read this book.

This pattern leads people to approach change in conditional ways wherein they calculate the perceived benefits of change against potential losses, and generally do not make choices (or renounce choice in ways) that compromise their own futurity or position of advantage (e.g., _“I want to transcend colonialism without giving anything up.”)._|
|**I**nnocence: Positioning oneself outside complicity in violence, often because of one’s stated commitment to be against violence. This pattern erases how our implication in harm is largely the product of our structural positions within harmful systems and of our learned, unconscious habits of being, rather than a product of active intellectual choices to hurt others (e.g., _“Because I say that I am against violent systems, that means I am no longer complicit in them.”)._|
|**R**ecentering: Privileging the feelings, experiences, and perspectives of oneself and/or the majority group/nation/etc. rather than looking at systemic dynamics of inequality and violence, and discerning from there the actions needed to work toward developing healthier possibilities for coexistence (e.g., _“How will this change affect me/make me feel?”)._|
|**C**ertainty: Desiring (and demanding) fixed, totalizing knowledge, simple and guaranteed answers to complex problems, and predeterminable outcomes before taking action. This pattern denies that all knowledge is situated and contextually (rather than universally) relevant, and that all solutions are partial, imperfect, and may either reproduce the problems they seek to address or create new ones (e.g., _“I deserve to know exactly what is going to happen, when, where, and how.”)._|
|**U**nrestricted autonomy: Placing primacy on one’s free choice and independence at the expense of honoring interdependence and responsibility. Further, this pattern envisions responsibility as an intellectual choice, often based on a cost–benefit, utility-maximizing analysis rather than a visceral pull to do what is needed in order to maintain respectful, reciprocal relationships based on trust and consent (e.g., _“I am not accountable to anyone but myself, unless I choose to be.”)._|
|**L**eadership: Framing oneself, _or_ another person or community, as uniquely worthy and deserving of the power to determine the type, mode, and direction of change. This pattern positions the exceptional person or group above critique and outside of complicity, thereby imposing unrealistic expectations that make it difficult to acknowledge the complexities and the good, the bad, the ugly, and the broken in everyone (e.g., _“Either I, or the person or group I designate, is exceptionally qualified and entitled to direct and determine the character of change.”)._|
|**A**uthority: Appointing oneself (or a designated person) as the moral and political authority with the right to arbitrate justice, or an epistemological authority with the right to adjudicate the truth and the most desirable path toward change. Generally, this pattern re-silences those who are systemically ignored, and imposes one’s own desires and expectations onto others’ existence (e.g., _“I should be the one to determine who and what is valuable and deserving of which rights, privileges, and punishments.”)._|
|**R**ecognition: Seeking affirmation of one’s righteousness, redemption, and exceptionalism (often to justify one’s merit and the enjoyment of privileges). Often, recognition is sought by curating (and trying to control) one’s public image and attempting to ensure that one is seen and heard as being and doing “good.” This circular pattern serves as a distraction from focusing on the work necessary to interrupt harmful systemic behaviors and desires in oneself and others (e.g., _“But don’t you see that I’m one of the ‘good’ ones?”)._|

Why Read (Or Not) This Book

The stories, tools, and exercises in this book invite you to witness and offer palliative care to modernity dying within and around you. The stories relate to modernity as a living entity with many facets, a complex adaptive system. They tell a tale of how modernity’s desires to conquer and engineer the world on its terms have given us remarkable gifts while also causing unimaginable suffering and destruction.

It is important to say that this book is not about fixing, rejecting, destroying, replacing, or transcending modernity—these desires are part of modernity (and are also faster than thought!). Instead, the stories invite you to sit with a quickly aging modernity as it approaches and resists its own death. You will be invited to offer modernity compassionate assistance while bearing witness to how it grapples with its own life story. This invitation can enable you to learn from modernity’s passions, promises, failures, fantasies, betrayals, and brokenness—all without drama or sentimentalism. Once we can process all of these difficult lessons, they become part and parcel of modernity’s gifts.

Thus, this book is about honoring the gifts of modernity by offering readers strategies to process their challenging teachings. The stories, tools, and exercises intend to help modernity die with integrity, having taught the lessons it came to teach and having made peace with its own mortality. However, because hospicing involves modernity dying within and around us, this can be a difficult, painful, disorienting, and destabilizing process, which may or may not be what you need in your life right now (or at all).

Those who will benefit most from this book are already wrestling with the complexities of a _dis-eased_ modernity, those who have already noticed that what worked before is no longer working, those who have arrived at a place where they do not know what to do. Conversely, those who are heavily invested in celebrating modernity or believe they have the answers as to how to fix or replace modernity may find this book challenging, and perhaps even damaging. I feel that my responsibility in this chapter is to give you as much warning as possible about the risks of reading this book so that you can decide for yourself whether it is the right book for you; and if it is, whether this is the right time for you to read it.

Different Readers, Different Responses

This is a book about hospicing modernity, but modernity itself conditions us to resist accepting its death. Before we know it (literally), modernity’s desires for universal formulas, consensual definitions, creative solutions, and hopeful futures can hijack our attempts to grapple with the complexities of its own dying. In this sense, it may be useful to evoke a distinction between _problems_ (things that can actually or potentially be fixed) and _predicaments_ (things that must constantly be dealt with, won’t be solved, and won’t go away). There is also a difference between something _complicated_ that can be sorted with careful planning or engineering (e.g., a long car trip with toddlers) and something _complex_ that is moving, multidimensional, and largely unruly, unmanageable, and unpredictable (e.g., raising children).

Modernity’s violence and unsustainability are usually interpreted within modernity as _complicated problems_ that can be solved rather than _complex predicaments_ that need to be confronted. This prevalent pattern of addressing the violence and unsustainability of modernity as complicated problems has major real-life implications. For example, a substantial amount of time and resources are invested in addressing the symptoms of violence and unsustainability rather than their root causes. And even when we look at the root causes, we try to manage them as problems rather than engage with them as complex predicaments.

This problem-solving compulsion also has serious implications as to how this book will be read by different people. From the outset, I must warn those readers seeking universal formulas, consensual definitions, hopeful alternatives, heroic role models, or revolutionary manifestos that this book could either be unbearably frustrating or perhaps open up a whole new world of possibilities.

For some readers, engaging with this book may be occasionally irritating, overwhelming, and discombobulating. In such cases, common responses may include defensiveness, deflection, and resistance. These conditioned responses are caused by unconscious affective feedback loops and emotional forecasts wherein people predict and then try to avoid feelings of embarrassment, shame, guilt, worthlessness, or powerlessness. Unfortunately, in order to disarm these affective land mines, we must seek them out—and risk them exploding as we walk; it is understandable why people may try to avoid that. However, this book can help you hold space for these responses from a more resilient and stable head/heart space.

Although unpleasant responses can teach people when they surface, they are not generative if people get stuck or trapped in them. Therefore, you will be offered strategies on how to move through a wide range of affective states. These strategies will eventually also help you develop the capacity to map your affective landscape and its potholes, ditches, and land mines. Once you have a better affective map, it should be much easier to avoid getting stuck. However, in order to map the location of a ditch, you need to get very close to it. To support you in getting closer to the ditches without falling in, you will also be offered tools to help interrupt the fear of approaching that edge and also to help you get out if you fall into a ditch. Initially, this will be challenging and uncomfortable, but with new tools, practice, discipline, and patience you should be able to get through the process.

Readers who have faith in modernity and want to protect it from dying will probably be annoyed, irritated, or outraged by the text. To them, it may seem like this book is actually trying to kill or to destroy modernity by announcing its death—something no book can do. Some readers will read this book selectively, looking to consume what fits their agendas and discard what does not. Some will look for something or someone to disagree with, and still others will respond to the book with anger and righteous indignation. Unfortunately, this is probably inevitable in these polarizing times of late modernity.

Readers who seek universal meanings and definitions, and neurodiverse readers who feel destabilized by paradoxes, uncertainty, and ambivalence, may feel disturbed by the unconventional use of pedagogy and language in this book. There is not much I can do about that other than tell them not to read the book. Please take this warning seriously. People can be damaged by what they don’t want or are not able to hear, and it is not my intention to do that to anyone. The choice to proceed—or not—is always yours.

I have attempted to map five general profiles of readers, based on how they may relate to modernity. This map is offered as a thought experiment designed to surface affective responses of resistance to what this book has to offer. The profiles are not exhaustive—many more profiles could be added. Readers who find themselves resonating with assumptions and investments listed in this map will likely express a dismissive reaction to at least some aspects of this book. This may or may not dissipate if they choose to read the rest of it. I invite you to use the exercise as a way to decide whether this book is for you.

---

## Exercise

You are invited to assess to what extent you align or identify with the assumptions and investments presented in the general profiles described below. You might see yourself in multiple profiles, but the key is to try to be honest with yourself regarding the gaps between where you see yourself and where you actually are, and also between how you see yourself and how others see you. Try to do this with humor and compassion; don’t take it too seriously. Consider this an exercise in learning to map your own affective landscape. If you disidentify strongly with or feel deeply offended by any of the descriptors, this may be an affective land mine proximity alert. Pay attention and carefully map the landscape by taking a step back and observing yourself reacting without investing in the reaction itself. You are also invited to create your own profile with some of the elements listed here.

**Profile A**

This profile encompasses people enchanted by modernity and heavily invested in its continuity—in avoiding modernity’s death at all costs. Those who align with this profile want to prove that modernity is the best thing that has ever happened to humanity and that there are no better alternatives, no alternatives worth considering, even no alternatives at all. Some people who identify with this profile believe that those who embody modernity and who are highly functional within it (including themselves) represent the apex of civilization and therefore should arbitrate for everyone which pathways should be pursued and which paths should not. Some believe that, in general, humans have never been healthier, wealthier, or happier. Those who associate with this profile are seeking arguments to justify the expansion of modernity; some might explain its violence and unsustainability as collateral damage; while others simply see this violence and unsustainability as lies that are part of a conspiracy theory designed to plot the destruction of modernity. Included in this general profile are those who want to save the environment by further commodifying it, and who seek arguments proposing that more modernity will solve the problems that modernity has created.

**Profile B**

This profile relates to people who are disenchanted with some aspects of modernity, but still believe modernity can be fixed so that its promises can be realized. This profile covers a wide range of perspectives, but those who tend to align with this profile think that only corrupt governments, elites, and corporations are to blame for the failures of modernity to deliver on its promises. They seek arguments that can affirm the universal fix that they have identified for it, be it policy, protest, religion, technology, population control, civil war, green deals, art, nuclear power, or any other technical or creative solution. Some people who identify with this profile believe that modernity has been derailed by capitalism and want to redirect modernity toward socialist or anarchist visions. Others promote equity, diversity, inclusion, and reconciliation so that we can all “move forward” with the project of modernity as a way of expanding access, opportunities, and social mobility to a larger group of people and realizing the dream of a universal middle class for all. People with this profile tend to demand the validation of their benevolent leadership, contribution, and agency, which tends to become an obstacle to deeper and more genuine forms of engagement with the world and other worldviews.

**Profile C**

This profile relates to people disenchanted with the aspects of modernity that have caused them harm; and they seek harm reduction, redress, and their legitimate place heading a more progressive modernity. Those who identify with this profile have been historically and systemically oppressed and feel that it is their turn to enjoy modernity’s benefits (regardless of their costs). They may seek arguments that mobilize support for their preferred form of social enfranchisement. Some people who identify with this profile have been invested in critiques of modernity and see themselves as outside of it, but still unconsciously reproduce modernity’s desires and modes of relationality and politics. Some seek the affirmation of their self-image as avant-garde or revolutionary. Given the multiple forms of violence inflicted upon their communities historically and systemically, many will understandably seek to mobilize critique and activism toward the pleasurable promises and entitlements of modernity as a form of compensation for past and ongoing harm.

**Profile D**

This profile relates to people who are disillusioned with many aspects of modernity and seek alternatives beyond modernity, _with guarantees._ They tend to see their chosen alternatives as outside of modernity—often not realizing how these alternatives are made possible by modernity itself, along with its entourage of violence and unsustainability. Some people who identify with this profile feel that they have already found a lifestyle that eliminates their complicity in harm and seek to boost a self-image of righteousness and virtue that is validated by people who share their beliefs. Some believe that love, oneness, or spiritual enlightenment can overcome modernity’s violence and, sometimes incessantly, seek arguments that can validate their sense of innocence and purity. When faced with critique, people who identify with this profile can unleash a landslide of highly charged forms of resistance and defensiveness, especially when they have invested a lot of hope in the viability, decency, and harmlessness of their choices and self-_resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira. In order to keep the sense of hope, faith, and belief alive, and as a form of legitimization and belonging, they need to recruit others into the same beliefs and choices.

**Profile E**

The fifth general profile relates to those who see the promises of modernity as broken, who feel shortchanged by modernity and want to force it to work for them at any cost. They feel that their freedoms and privileges are under attack and want to defend their perceived entitlements to unrestricted autonomy and self-expression—without accountability. They seek arguments that affirm their sense of victimization and they use this to legitimize aggression, scapegoating, and calls for escalating violence. They mobilize antagonism and the allure of transgression as successful means of recruitment. They feel wronged by and deeply resent the elitism of liberal meritocracies with a mix of envy and disgust, since they also perceive it as a source of constant humiliation and powerlessness. In this sense, they want not only to win power, but also to vanquish the opponent completely. They proclaim that they seek a return to traditional roles and social hierarchies perceived to be disrupted by people they view as interfering with the “natural order” of society. They also tend to seek arguments that increase their sense of self-importance and popularity on social media, with no regard to the veracity of their claims.

---

What to Expect

The profiles illustrate a specific template of stories of change within modernity. These stories start with the articulation of a problem with the system that needs to be solved. The degree of the problem can vary from the system “not working optimally” to “totally damaged.” The logical solutions proposed necessarily need to keep our hopes (in the futurity of modernity) up: “we” the (virtuous, woke, righteous, deserving, or enlightened) people on the “good team” can choose to fix the system by either patching it up or offering a known replacement, a better alternative.

The analysis in this book has a different starting point. It begins with an examination of how violence and unsustainability are conditions that are necessary for modernity to exist, how we are part of modernity (and complicit in harm), and how modernity has both offered us gifts and harmed all of us. This analysis is about how modernity:

- has kept us tied and addicted to its promises and comforts;
- has limited the ways we can see, feel, relate, desire, heal, and imagine;
- has led us to deny the violence and unsustainability that are required for it to exist, as well as our interdependence and the depth and magnitude of the mess we are in;
- has encouraged us to create narcissistic delusions about our sense of self-importance and our perceived entitlements, keeping us in a fragile and immature state that leaves us unequipped to face the challenges of our times;
- has untethered us from the realities of the planet, and the fact that our mode of existence has caused the extinction of multiple species and is set to cause our own.

This analysis also emphasizes how immensely difficult (but not impossible) it is to interrupt these patterns and let go of the harmful attachments and codependence we have developed with modernity itself, so that we can learn to let it go and create space for something genuinely new to even become possible. Without this cognitive, affective, and relational clearing, we will only be able to want and imagine different versions of the same thing.

Therefore, readers who will find this book most useful are already going through disenchantments and disillusionments with multiple aspects of modernity (no one is completely disenchanted with all of it). Some of these readers may feel extremely frustrated and disheartened with self-serving, feel-good, quick-fix approaches to social and global change because they cannot ignore the complexities and paradoxes related to modernity’s violence and unsustainability. However, they may feel ill-equipped to navigate these complexities and paradoxes and may find themselves immobilized without the tools for getting unstuck. They may also feel that they do not have words to describe what they are going through or a community that could relate to their struggle. Others, who may already be used to examining complicities and privilege, may be seeking new vocabularies and support to face the difficulties and failures of this kind of work.

What you can expect from this book is assistance to sit at the edge of modern modes of relating to the world; and to work through the denials of violence, unsustainability, entanglement, and the depth of the challenges we face—understanding that modernity rewards upholding these denials. You will be taught some of the acrobatic steps needed when learning to walk on a tightrope between projective (naive/delusional) hope and projective (nihilistic, hedonistic, or misanthropic) hopelessness, but it is you who must ultimately find the balance. This book is about rescuing hope from the cages of projections into the future and enabling it to weave relationships and movements in the present—the very texture that futures are made of. Whatever happens “then” depends more on the quality of relationships in the “now” than on the accuracy or appeal of _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira of the future that one projects as a way forward.

The stories and exercises in this book are not trying to convince you of anything. They are neither descriptive nor prescriptive; they may be better described as provocative and integrative. They seek to create some generative chaos in your existence in order to make you somewhat uncomfortable and activate learning in your “stretch zone.” These stories seek to move you from a state where you may be stuck within modernity’s cognitive, affective, and relational structures toward other possibilities, but they do not seek to determine the form or format of these possibilities for you. Furthermore, these stories are not intended to convince you to leave modernity or to “trash” modernity’s structures, but rather to help you grapple with the limits of these structures and how they are gradually becoming obsolete, and to take account of the often invisibilized costs of sustaining them.

If you find yourself wondering, “What political or ideological position does this book want me to align with?” The answer is, “I am not asking you to align with anything!” I don’t know your context; I don’t know what is happening around you. All I am asking of you is to be open to a head/heart experiment. I am also not trying to please you or to play to your expectations—simply because I am not trying to recruit you for anything. The point of this book is not to gather followers. This has been tried before and has failed every time. I (lovingly) don’t care about what you think, but I care deeply about our collective capacity to dig deeper and to relate “wider.” In order to make possible deeper engagements and better relationships we will need to reactivate capacities for sensing, relating, and imagining that have been deactivated within modernity. This does not require you to abandon convictions—just the arrogance, indifference, and contempt that modernity has implanted in all of us.

Generative disenchantment and disillusionment with modernity’s modes of relationship are indispensable aspects of hospicing modernity, processing its teachings, and composting its waste. This creates new, fertile soil for other possibilities of existence to emerge. There is a popular saying in Brazil that illustrates this insight using water, rather than soil, as a metaphor. The saying goes that in a flood situation, it is only when the water reaches people’s hips that it becomes possible for them to swim. Before that, with the water at our ankles or knees, it is only possible to walk or to wade. In other words, we might only be able to learn to swim—that is, to exist differently—once we have no other choice.

People’s priorities are bound to the level of water around them. As the waters rise, but have not yet reached our hips, we can prepare by learning to open ourselves to the teachings of the water, as well as the teachings of those swimming for their lives against multiple currents of colonial violence. This is the same violence that supports our comforts and securities within modernity.

This book draws on and is inspired by Indigenous teachings from communities of high-intensity struggle in what is known as Latin America and Canada, who swim against the flood of colonialism that subsidizes modernity. However, these communities are diverse and complex, and do not have answers applicable in all contexts. They cannot tell us exactly how to swim in the waters rising around us because their techniques are specific to their particular contexts. On the other hand, they do have practices that remind us that the flood is coming for us as well, that our bodies can swim, that human bodies are mostly water, that we are entangled with water as a living entity, that our existence begins in the water, and that beyond our temporal human embodiment we also _are_ the water.

Interrupting Self-Infantilization

The stories of this book heed the Indigenous insight that amongst all other animals humans are the youngest, and amongst all human cultures the modern culture is the youngest and is caught up in a loop of immature, irresponsible, and self-infantilizing behaviors. Therefore, the stories issue an invitation for modern humans to wake up, smarten up, step up, own up, clean up, grow up, and show up differently as the metabolism of the planet and humanity within it face enormous challenges.

You may find this invitation somewhat patronizing and all these explanations about what this book intends to do repetitive and unnecessary. Good! That is your first chance to turn your defensiveness and resistance into teachers showing you how unconscious investments, projections, and insecurities are socially conditioned. When this happens, it may be useful to ask, “How could the modern assumptions and colonial desires informing my reaction be restricting possibilities for me to sense, relate, and imagine otherwise?” or, in other words, “What could I be missing out on?” If you find this question irrelevant, please gift the book to someone for whom this question could be important.

Losing the satisfaction we have with self-infantilization can also be a difficult process with detrimental consequences. Imagine how you might feel when what is pleasurable and comforting for you may no longer feel appealing. Imagine no longer being able to enjoy the sense of self you previously held because it no longer offers the satisfaction you expect. Consider the effects this may have on your relationships and social circles. Despite this book trying to ground you in other forms of wellness and sources of vitality, there is a slight risk you may get stuck in a state of dissatisfaction with no way out. For some this may feel like standing at a locked gate and having nowhere left to return to.

Since most affective and relational investments are unconscious, their interruptions are extremely difficult and rare. These interruptions can also often be very painful and similar to the interruption of addictions. Think of it as a form of disenchantment and disillusionment with our known world that can happen suddenly, abruptly, and randomly; or slowly, gradually, and with assistance. If you knew that disenchantment and disillusionment with the promises of modernity were eventually inevitable, which path would you choose: sudden, abrupt, and random, or slow, gradual, and potentially assisted?

Here is the deal: this book may be able to help with the second option. The stories, tools, and exercises were designed to make it possible for you to hold disenchantment and disillusionment in a different space where modernity within and around you can die in generative ways. We can soften the crash, but not prevent it: disenchantment and disillusionment will happen, one way or another. But it is your call whether to move toward it now or not, slowly or not, with assistance or not. The book is not pushing you, either way.

However, if you do choose assistance, you must consider your side of the deal. I need you to agree (at least temporarily) to sit with the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, the broken, and the messed up of humanity and modernity within and around you. I ask you to choose depth over drama, to stay with the trouble, to walk toward the storm with the stories you will dance with. I ask you to allow this book to constantly invite you to look at the world in the mirror to see what is real and not turn away. This is what “sitting with” means and it is very different from strategies to fix or save the world that promise you validation, triumph, power, and pleasure. If you are really looking for strategies that can make you feel good, look good, and move forward, and if you know that this is what you need right now, do not read this book. Seriously, put it down.

I actually feel it is my responsibility at this point to urge you not to read this book. This statement is not about whether I think the book will be useful for you—only you can decide. The statement is a way to ask you to stop and consider why you should proceed after all the warnings issued so far. Are you just curious? Do you really have an idea of what you are getting into? What if the process is costly for you? What if getting to see, sense, relate, and imagine differently has a price in your context that right now you are not aware of, and if you were, you would not be prepared to pay? What if you find motivations and responsibilities you won’t be able to ignore, but no one around you will understand you anymore? This may sound like I am being pretentious and overstating what this book can do; fair enough, you could just consume this as we are all used to, or simply ignore it. But what if the stories land where they will and manage to do the work they intended? It is your call, your responsibility. Do not put it on me. You have been warned.

If you do not agree with the premises of this book and decide not to proceed, I respect your dissent. If you decide to proceed, the next chapter will offer you seven basic indispensable tools for witnessing modernity. Yes, you will need to wait a little longer for stories and exercises, but without the tools presented next, the stories in subsequent chapters may have very little chance of landing.

The Most Important Chapter

If, despite all the warnings so far, you have chosen to proceed with reading this book, this is the most important chapter. If you skip this one, I guarantee you will regret it later.

This book offers a language and a pedagogical approach to _clear the space_ for the possibility of seeing, sensing, relating, and imagining _otherwise_ to emerge. Since modernity’s logic is one of accumulation, it conditions us to hoard stuff (both literally and metaphorically), thinking it might one day be relevant. Imagine a huge attic or garage where you store the things you no longer use, but that you are strongly attached to and can’t bear to get rid of. Many of the abstract things cluttering your attic or garage are just fantasies occupying a lot of space. Others are traumas that you have not processed and that are sabotaging you and negatively affecting others in unseen ways. In many cases there is little of real value in there, but you don’t feel like clearing it because it is tedious, dusty, and potentially embarrassing.

Modernity also conditions us to avoid, escape, or want to be rescued from discomfort and to gravitate toward what validates our ego-logical desires for the 6 “Cs” of comfort, convenience, consumption, certainty, control, and coherence. In this context, decluttering does not stand a chance of becoming a priority. As a result, we just keep building up more stuff that gives us a temporary feeling of contentment and security. However, the more stuff we accumulate, the more this stuff distracts and prevents us from being present to what is real and relevant in the world inside and outside of ourselves. Even those who identify as transgressive or nonconforming may find decluttering difficult.

This chapter presents seven important frameworks, _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira, and strategies you will need in order to create a head/heart container for this clearing to happen. Think about it as a safety kit and a toolbox. These tools are both indispensable and insufficient, meaning they can support you in creating the space to do this work, but you still need to do your part. Learning to use this toolkit is not something that is easy or that happens overnight. You will often need to return to this chapter.

Some of the tools offered in this chapter will be used in other chapters’ exercises. Some will support you in creating conditions to hold space for difficulty and discomfort. Others will help you recalibrate your expectations in relation to what this book can do for you. The frameworks and _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira will also invite you to explore different reasons why our formal education and socialization within modernity do not equip us well to hold space for complexity, uncertainty, ambiguity, paradoxes, and failure.

The seven basic tools (frameworks, _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira, and strategies) are:

1. Mastery _and_ depth education
2. Wording _and_ worlding the world
3. The bus within us
4. Layering existence _and_ experience
5. Low- _and_ high-intensity struggles
6. Generative _dis_illusionment and exiled capacities
7. Co-sensing with radical tenderness

I strongly advise you to become familiar with this set of tools so you can more fully engage with the stories and exercises in this book.

Tool 1: Mastery **_and_** Depth Education

Within modernity, when we evoke the word _education,_ what comes to mind is usually an image of schools. We forget that education is much broader than schooling—it spans the whole length and width of life. Education happens constantly as we process and internalize what emerges from our interactions with the world in and around us. We also tend to think about education as a commodity that gives us something of value; or as credentials that can be recognized, exchanged, or rewarded in the various economies of modernity.

We have come to expect only the type of education that gives us a sense of mastery—a form of education that is transactional, that gives us predictable learning outcomes, and that is based on the transfer of content and the development of competencies and skills that can enhance a person’s efficiency and value within modernity. In its most recent and most popular format, mastery education promises to be learner-centered; respect learners’ preferences; give learners voice and choice; create a menu of valuable and easily digestible information and experiences for learners’ consumption; treat learners as customers; and to keep them comfortable, hopeful, motivated, validated, and satisfied.[^1] Mastery education can focus on the self-actualization, self-regulation, self-authorship, self-realization, self-expression, or self-care of the individuated self. It feels empowering, strengthens identities, and is often oriented toward affirming and boosting learners’ egos.

There are many other orientations of education that are systemically erased within modernity.[^2] In this book, mastery education is contrasted with “depth education.” This is defined as a mode of engagement designed to prompt us to dig deeper and to relate wider, disinvest in harmful desires,[^3] activate accountability and responsibility before will[^4] (not as an intellectual choice or a transactional calculation), and become open to being taught by the world in unexpected ways.[^5] Depth education focuses on complexities and paradoxes and it invites all of us to sit with difficulties; unpack investments; confront resistance; disarm affective land mines; relate beyond meaning, identity, and understanding; rationally explore the limits of rationality; and face humanity within and around us in all its complexity: the good, the bad, the broken, and the messed up. When effectively mobilized, depth education feels disarming, scales down the importance of the ego, and expands possibilities for relationships.

If mastery education can be associated with the filling of a cup, depth education is about transforming the cup into an onion and allowing ourselves to experience the pain and joy of peeling its layers. While contemporary mastery education encourages learners to voice their opinions, aspirations, likes, and dislikes; depth education encourages learners to step back to observe with skepticism one’s own personal narratives, desires, and identifications and disidentifications. While mastery education instigates the performance of learners’ identities and self-expression, depth education assumes that we are unreliable narrators of our own experiences and invites an inquiry into the ways we could be stuck, what we resist or try to run away from, and how different modes of knowing and being mobilize different relations, possibilities, and transformations in the world.

While mastery education focuses on predefined _fixed_ meanings, descriptions, narratives, maps, and points of arrival; depth education focuses on the movement of patterns, stories, and affective landscapes, as well as the intellectual and relational rigor and integrity of the (un)learning process. Depth education, as defined here, is an orientation toward activating capacities and dispositions that can enable us to hold space for difficult and painful things, and to sense, relate, and imagine otherwise as we face the end of modernity or the world as we know it.

If mastery education can be associated with the image of conquering a peak, depth education is about diving into a freezing ocean in the dark, without an oxygen tank, in order to find out that we are both the water and the plastics and toxins that we (humans) dump into it.

## Exercise

To what extent do you think your relationship with education has been conditioned by mastery education? How much exposure have you had to depth education? How do you understand the differences between the objectives and approaches of mastery and depth education? What resistance to depth education do you think would emerge for those who are oversocialized in mastery education? Would you be able to recognize depth education if you came across it?

Tool 2: Wording **_and_** Worlding the World

Storytelling in different cultures, especially in many Indigenous cultures,[^6] manifests in ways that are different from how it manifests in modernity. In many contexts, including my extended family, stories are not human-made tools of communication that aim to index the world into language, or to word the world.[^7] Instead, stories are entities that visit and move things in the world, in nonlinear time: they are stories that world the world. I offer an example that illustrates this worlding of the world in practice.

In many different communities throughout the world there are stories of intelligent, powerful, small sentient beings usually called “little people,” who live in the forests and can make themselves invisible to human eyesight. (In Western cultures these would be gnomes, fairies, elves, trolls, etc.) If kinship is honored, these small sentient beings can show human relatives where to find food, water, or medicine; where to sleep safely; or how to find their way back home if they get lost. If they are ignored by human relatives visiting the forest—which they look after—these sentient beings can make the visitors get hurt or lost by fogging and meddling with the visitors’ thoughts and vision. Therefore, the best advice is to acknowledge their presence, recognize their gifts and their labor, and show reverence to kinship by asking permission to enter the forest and making offerings of berries or song.

If a person is not familiar with this type of storytelling, at this point invariably some obvious questions come up: “Is it myth or reality?” “Is it science or folklore?” or “Is it true?” I have observed how the Indigenous people I work with answer the “is it true” question. They usually surprise people with an unexpected answer, which is generally a version of: “Sometimes.”

Instead of “Is this story true?” or “What does this story mean?”—questions that come from the expectation that stories will describe reality and convey a fixed meaning—the approach to storytelling illustrated here invites us to ask, “What is this story trying to move?” and “What does it do over time and to time itself?” The story of the small sentient beings at a very basic level may be trying to move us into a more respectful relationship with the land, with forests, and with other forms of life. The evocation of unseen manifestations of relationality (i.e., the “little people” being able to turn thoughts foggy by tapping unconscious forms of communication) may move us to consider how we are related and accountable to what is unknowable, things that are not visible or imaginable within and around us.

The emphasis on the request for permission and the need for offerings may move us to consider a practice of _consent, trust, respect, reciprocity, and accountability._ By requesting reverence toward nonhuman beings occupying a position of authority as forest custodians, the story may direct us to decenter ourselves, as humans, from the center of the world, to shed our arrogance, and to approach the land from a place of humility. If the story is retold several times, its power to “land” in our bodies and to move things expands.

On the one hand, I should say that this approach to storytelling and the stories that come from it emerge from oral practices where voice, pitch, pause, breathing, rhythm, intonation, relationships, setting, and repetition are all integral to the mutual dance that the telling and the story create. I am not convinced that alphabetic writing, with its usual focus on fixed form and general obsession with description and prescription, can have a similar effect or do justice to this approach. On the other hand, if we are to open different possibilities for seeing, sensing, relating, and imagining, we will need to figure out how to interrupt our usual ways of doing things and the satisfaction we have with what has been normalized as natural, true, and desirable. Technologies such as writing will need to be used experimentally, in different ways.

Inspired by this mode of storytelling, this book is a collection of worlding stories that are not trying to word the world, but to world the world. Worlding stories are not trying to index reality in language, to arrive at a perfectly secure place of description or prescription, or to wrap the world with a single heavy blanket of interpretation. They do not emerge from the Cartesian _cogito ergo sum_ (I think therefore I am, or I say therefore it is); they are not trying to make sense of things in order to convey or confer mastery, authority, or control; and their intention is not to win or to “conquer” a debate.

Worlding stories are _not_ focused on the aesthetic perfection of form, but on the integration of form and movement. They are not supposed to be “thought about,” but thought, felt, and danced with and through. They play with the ambivalence and dynamic force of meaning. In this sense, meaning will change as a worlding story lands deeper into the body, a story will have many layers of changing meaning, and some layers will only reveal themselves years after the story arrives. Worlding stories invite us to experiment with a different relationship between language and reality. These stories do not require anyone to believe _in_ anything; rather they invite you to believe _with_ them. However, these stories cannot work on you without your consent. Taking worlding stories seriously makes possible a significant change in your ways of seeing, sensing, and relating to the world.

## Exercise

To what extent have you been socialized in wording the world and worlding the world? To what extent have you been searching for fixed meanings? What roles do stories play in your life? What do you expect them to do? How do you respond when words refuse to be captured in a fixed form or when they dance with multiple layers of meaning? Why do you tell stories? To what extent have you been exposed to genuinely different stories of and about the world?

Tool 3: The Bus within Us

“The bus within us” is a methodology created to support us in identifying and interrupting the nongenerative manifestation of the modern desire for a unified, coherent, and self-transparent self. Within modernity, maturity is associated with the rule of mind and reason over emotions and the body. This mature self should be unified in a coherent personality (i.e., under control) that sees both the world and itself objectively (i.e., with self-transparency). In social media, this desire for coherence and self-transparency can be seen at work in echo chambers that affirm a group’s worldview while preventing exposure to other viewpoints. It is also at work when people respond defensively when their self-_resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira are challenged. This investment in coherence and self-transparency grounded in a supposedly universal and objective view of reality severely limits our capacity to face and address plurality, uncertainty, ambiguity, and unknowability—both within ourselves and in the world at large.

The bus methodology invites us to see a whole bus of people within us. At its most basic level, this bus has a driver and many passengers who embody what has marked one’s lifetime, including childhood events, unprocessed traumas, significant others, etc. Some of these passengers are at the front of the bus and their voices are loud and well known, some are seated in the middle of the bus and can only be heard at the front in certain occasions, and some are at the back and may even be unknown to the driver(s). Sometimes there is conflict amongst the passengers. Sometimes there are rebellions on the bus and it can be hijacked by rogue passengers. Sometimes passengers temporarily replace the driver. Sometimes the bus goes too fast and passengers become nauseated from the movement, requiring attention. The basic premise of the methodology is that if we cannot hold space for the complexities within us, there is no chance for us to hold space for the complexities around us.[^8]

The bus methodology can help us work with our unconscious in playful ways to make connections and associations that may bypass our ego-logical defenses. For example, if something prompts defensiveness or resistance, you can pause to “check your bus” and instead of embodying resistance, you can take a step back, see this resistance expressed by a passenger on your bus, and pay attention to what this passenger is teaching through what they are saying or through their interactions or conflicts with other passengers. If the idea of the bus is unrelatable, you can try different _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira like an orchestra, a theater, a village, a campfire, an ant farm, squirrels on a spaceship, or whatever works for you. The image itself is just a prop for the analysis.

As you read this book, the bus methodology will be evoked in exercises that invite you to be present to the feelings, sensations, and emotions the stories prompt in you. Emotions are usually perceived to be abstract concepts rather than physiological manifestations. In an attempt to interrupt this tendency, we prefer to use the term _affect_ to emphasize the fact that these physical sensations happen through and in between our bodies, and that their manifestations are much more complex than the meanings we usually attribute to them. Affects are neurochemical discharges reinterpreted through our filters of experience.

Talking about “affective responses” rather than “emotions” shifts the conversation away from abstract and moral understandings of the modern mind/body dichotomy toward seeing emotions and thoughts as neurobiological processes. These neurobiological processes happen within a living organism (the individual body) that is also nested within and conditioned by wider organisms (collective bodies) that are metabolically connected. It may be useful to decondition the ways we interpret these affective responses. Lisa Feldman Barrett[^9] suggests a helpful new vocabulary to describe affective responses that can also be used within the bus methodology. This vocabulary is based on three criteria: 1) the levels of intensity or arousal of a sensation; 2) the levels of pleasantness or unpleasantness of this sensation; and 3) whether this sensation is depleting or nourishing your sense of vitality or “body budget.” That said, I should also mention that the bus methodology is not based on Western psychology or psychoanalysis, which locate the origins of the psyche in the human body and in human meaning. The bus methodology is based on a non-Western and non-anthropocentric form of psychoanalysis that locates the origin of the psyche in a conscious living “land.” I illustrate this in the next section.

When the bus methodology is used with groups, one of the basic exercises we invite participants to do involves drawing three people on their bus who have contradictory responses in relation to the same topic. The drawing should include speech, thought, and heart bubbles representing what each passenger is saying, thinking, and feeling. Participants are asked to pay attention to each passenger and to try to assess their age, their fears, their aspirations; whether they are speaking from trauma; what may irritate them; their level of tolerance for plurality and ambiguity; and any contradictory aspects in relation to what they think, feel, and say.

This exercise gives a glimpse of the basic purpose of the bus methodology: to support people in developing the basic dispositions to witness and support the passengers on their own bus in processing what is happening in and around them. This is essential if we want to interrupt the modern obsessive compulsion with ego-logical coherence in order to learn to hold space for our internal complexities—which, in turn, will help us hold space for the complexities in all layers of existence and experience around us.

---

## Exercise

Check your bus. It may be difficult to imagine the bus in the beginning. Let it show itself to you (remember it may show itself as another image). Pay attention to the conversations happening within this image. Who is driving? Can you identify passengers at the front, in the middle, and at the back of the bus? Focus on three passengers who have different affective responses to the bus methodology. What are they thinking, saying, and feeling? Can you describe their sensations using the vocabulary of high/low arousal, pleasantness/unpleasantness, and depletion or nourishment of vitality proposed by Barrett? How challenging is it to think of yourself as a bus?

Tool 4: Layering Existence **_and_** Experience

In terms of layers of existence and experience, another tool used in this book is called “layering.” Modernity conditions us to think in only a singular, linear layer based on an objective description of reality. In this context, contradictions and paradoxes are perceived as an impediment to sustaining linearity, progress, and coherence, and need to be eliminated. This severely limits our capacity to develop discernment and to hold space for a range of multiple and conflicting thoughts, feelings, desires, and relationships. In the hyper-complexity and informational fragmentation of contemporary modernity, the singular layer is overwhelmed with a flood of clashing emotions and multiple narratives competing for universal status.

Layering can be applied to many different processes and interactions. For example, you can think about it as different layers of your experience of the self:

- there is the digital or virtual “me”—the self-image you have crafted and projected into the world (e.g., through social media);
- there is the embodied me—your organic body, which may or may not resemble that projection;
- there is me _and_ you—the social body of the groups you interact with;
- there is me _in_ you—the wider metabolism of which our individual and collective bodies are an extension; and
- there is “us” in neither me nor you—all that we are beyond form, space, and time.

There is also a layer where we focus on what different people and contexts mirror back to us about ourselves.

Layering can also be incorporated into the bus methodology in relation to different decks of the bus. The basic deck could represent the “me” layer. Another deck could represent “the societies that myself and my ancestors have lived in or engaged with” (including their conflicts and wars). The next deck could represent “the whole of humanity, past, present, and future,” while a further deck could represent “all entities on the planet, including those with a much longer temporality than humans, like rocks, trees, turtles, and rivers.” And yet another deck could be the bus where my passengers and your passengers travel together. This is a way of sensing the whole of humanity (and beyond) within you—including the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, the broken, and the messed up.

The layering tool also encourages the layering of intellectual, affective, and relational realms of individual experience, and the layering of social experience according to both context and affinity (e.g., the political realm, the organizational realm, the virtual realm, the realm of close friendships, the realm of romantic relationships, the institutional realm). This may help us build capacity to hold space for paradoxes and contradictions between and within realms. For example, while one thing may be useful in the existential realm (e.g., practices that mobilize a sense of oneness), the same thing could be detrimental in the political realm (e.g., mobilizing oneness as an argument to shut down legitimate challenges to power relations, including challenges to racial violence).

As you read this book, try to layer both your existence and your realms of experience. Sometimes an insight may be existentially rather than politically useful, and vice versa. Sometimes an insight may be problematic in one layer, but not in another. For example, the problematization of coherence may be necessary in one layer, but coherence may not be always problematic—in other layers it may be necessary. Specific insights will work differently in different layers. Perhaps the only insight applicable across layers is the need to hold space for movements and dynamic integration. It is your job to park the insights you will encounter in appropriate layers according to your own context, and to be mindful of when they can be mobilized in nongenerative ways within and across layers and realms.

## Exercise

Imagine you are in a room with two groups of people. On one side, you have people with lived experiences of systemic marginalization who are interested in critical analyses and political action. On the other side of the room, you have people who do not have significant experiences of marginalization and who are interested in “moving forward” and in having their experiences and opinions validated. How do you think the groups may clash in terms of different orientations to relationship building, use of the space, relationship to discomfort, and ideals of the ways forward? How could you use the layering process to make resonances, dissonances, and tensions visible and to issue an invitation to accountability that will “land” for both sides? How can you do this in a way that does not attract aggression from either side?

Tool 5: Low- **_and_** High-Intensity Struggles

This book was written for those involved in low-intensity (also low-risk and low-stakes) struggles. This term refers to those who have benefited the most and still enjoy the protections that modernity offers, as they fight to change things within or beyond modernity. If you have the time, energy, and literacy necessary to read this book, you fit this category. This means that, despite our transgressions and rebellions and our ideals of revolution, our struggles do not structurally jeopardize our survival: we have a choice to show up or not, to become visible or not, to be arrested or not, to take risks or not. Since we already have access to a level of social welfare secured for us, these choices tend not to fundamentally threaten our safety.

In contrast, those involved in high-intensity struggle mostly won’t have access to such choices. These are communities whose lives subsidize the comforts and securities that we enjoy. Some people in high-intensity (and high-risk, high-stakes) struggles are fighting to be part of modernity. Others are fighting for the possibility of a different existence. Everyone reproduces, to different extents, modernity’s violence (no one is off the hook). This is complex and complicated, and these terms are not mobilized to create hierarchies of worth of struggles or peoples, but to mark important differences in terms of sensibilities, vulnerabilities, sacrifices, types of labor, workloads, and sense of time and urgency.

If this book was written for those in high-intensity struggle, it would be very different in terms of topics, tone, and choice of stories and words. It probably would not exist as a book, but take the form of live practices, including land-based practices, rituals, and modes of silence and conversation. It is virtually impossible to write a book that would work in addressing both audiences in high- and low-intensity struggles. In this sense, there is no universal language or sensibility that could cut across communities. What makes for an optimal collaborative learning experience for those in low-intensity struggle will likely be triggering and emotionally taxing for those in high-intensity struggle and vice versa. Each requires a different mode of engagement.

The pedagogy of this book invites those in low-intensity struggle to surface their patterns of thought and desire and to develop a stance where they can layer reality and observe themselves holding space for their own complexities. The ideal scenario is for the exercises to help you see yourself from the perspective of those who have been harmed by patterns of modernity that you also reproduce; and who may think that your veiled or explicit arrogance, self-image, and sense of self-importance are, plainly speaking, _ridiculous._ People who are socialized within modernity are terrified of hearing or sensing their own ridiculousness because modernity codes it as a form of demotion, humiliation, or belittlement. I invite you to experience the absurdity of modernity within and around you as a form of connection, endearment, and liberation from the grip of arrogance; as a way to laugh at yourself and be taught by the precarity, brokenness, and imperfection of our collective existence. This is also an invitation for you not to turn your back to the shadows that become visible when placed in the spotlight.

---

## Exercise

Imagine you are in a room full of people coming from high-intensity struggle. You are carrying ridiculously oversized baggage full of your (mostly contextually irrelevant) experience, and you sense that they are all looking at your baggage and legitimately rolling their eyes. How many people on your bus want to just disappear or explain just how very relevant you think your experience is? How many people on your bus would feel victimized, belittled, angry, or defensive? Can you look at your baggage and roll your eyes with the other people? Can you see yourself as cute _and_ pathetic? Can you laugh at yourself? What could you be taught by the experience of being read and learning to read yourself in this way?

Tool 6: Generative **_Dis_**illusionment and Exiled Capacities

Hospicing modernity involves many events of productive disillusionment, where we start to feel disenchanted by the promises and pleasures that modernity offers. Modernity harnesses our fear of disillusionment for its own ends. However, the interruption of illusions and delusions should not be viewed as negative. If we are not yet capable of holding space for disillusionment, this is precisely where we need to start building capacity. Disillusionment is a condition for clearing the way for other forms of existence to be able to emerge without being suffocated by our modern desires, projections, and expectations. This clearing requires that we interrupt our satisfaction with what modernity offers and that we begin to crack our narcissistic mirrors, so that we can open up for the “possibility of possibilities”: the sense that other forms of existence, not yet legible at this stage of the process, can indeed exist.

Remember that you don’t have to agree with anything in this book to allow it to work for you. This mode of engagement is not about what you think, neither is it an examination or evaluation of your character or worth. It is actually quite the opposite. This book is about how we inhabit the entity of modernity and how this entity inhabits and affects all of us, unevenly (this is not a competition). In order to do its work, the exercises will work from the premise that we are all implicated in the violence and unsustainability of modernity. This may come across as harsh, accusatory, unfair, or something that restricts possibilities of interpretation. When you feel that way or when you feel resistance to the exercises, I invite you to first sit with the discomfort as an opportunity for (un)learning. However, if the exercises are not working for you for some reason and you know that you are not trying to escape from discomfort, I invite you to rebel and write your own exercises.

The pedagogy behind the exercises offers tools that can support you to hold space differently for yourself and for others, and that can help you activate exiled capacities and dispositions deactivated by the media, formal education, and our socialization within the structures of modernity. This book grants you unconditional regard: respect for your being, irrespective of your identity, background, or affiliations. Remember that I lovingly don’t care about what you think, but I do care very deeply about our collective capacity to dig deeper, to relate wider, to engage in productive disillusionment, and to fall apart and together generatively, as we face the end of the world as we know it.

Many people perceive this as an invitation to feel better. They are actually right, but not in the way they anticipate feeling better to feel, taste, and look. What is imagined by feeling better within modernity (including by those who are critical of modernity) is usually associated with mastery education, which centers the individuated self or a specific group of humans. This is _not_ what this invitation is about. This book maps ways to reactivate exiled capacities and dispositions so that we can face the extremely challenging task of moving noncoercively away from modern colonial desires for human exceptionalism, unrestricted autonomy, and infinite entitlement and start moving toward accountable autonomy and unconditional responsibility, before will. The level of difficulty of this task may be higher than that of interrupting substance abuse, because this has not yet been tried.

This book proposes that this interruption of harmful patterns and subsequent rehabilitation require:

- **d**ecentering, **d**isarming, and **d**ethroning the ego;
- **d**ecluttering the unconscious;
- **d**eactivating affective land mines;
- **d**eveloping responsive **d**iscernment;
- **d**isinvesting from modern/colonial desires; and
- recalibrating the vital compass of humanity toward sobriety, maturity, and integration-without-separation.[^10]

This process involves realizing our entanglement not only with beautiful things in the world, but also with the saturated collective and individual “shit” of different forms of violence, greed, unprocessed traumas, harmful projections and addictions, narcissism, hedonism, hyperindividualism, and consumerism in all its forms. It involves opening up to being taught by humanity’s and modernity’s wrongs. It involves examining the ways in which our current neurobiological wiring has destroyed the possibility of life for many other cultures and species and is set to destroy our own. It involves the painful process of seeing ourselves as unreliable narrators of our own experience and of breaking narcissistic mirrors. Exiled capacities and dispositions are essential for these difficult processes, but they are not an end in themselves and should not be used as a form of indulgent escape from these difficulties.

Capacities and dispositions that have been exiled by modernity can move us away from the sense of separation between us and the planet, other animals, other beings, and each other. They can also deactivate the intrinsic sense of belittlement, insignificance, and worthlessness that comes with this sense of separation, or separability. Indigenous practices that have kept alive some of these capacities and dispositions can teach us that the modern search for meaning and meaningfulness that attempts to codify the world to control it severely limits our capacity for “being.” Grounding the security of being in articulated meaning prevents us from experiencing being grounded in “sense-fullness”[^11]—a way of experiencing ourselves as an extension of a plural, relatively unknowable, always unfolding, bio-intelligent world.[^12]

Sense-making has been elevated, rewarded, and amplified by modernity to the point where it overrides all other senses. We tend to only legitimize what makes sense (in articulated meaning): what we can understand through chains of words. As a result, a whole world of _unsayable_ possibilities is dismissed as meaningless. Conversely, sense-fullness is the disposition to be receptive to and to integrate what is communicated by the bio-intelligence of the planet, including what can and what cannot be expressed through words.

In addition, within modernity, change is only imagined as something that is motivated by self-interest, by people fighting for access or protecting privileges and perceived entitlements (for groups or individuals). The idea that people can noncoercively surrender a violent and unsustainable form of existence as an act not grounded in self-interest is unthinkable—some would even say unnatural (if you see the privileging of self-interest as a feature of human nature, rather than a learned condition) or impossible.

However, there is a vast array of possibilities of existence that are viable, but that are unthinkable or unimaginable within modernity. In this book, we refer to these possibilities as the “adjacent possible.”[^13] For the adjacent possible to become imaginable we need to reactivate exiled capacities and dispositions that will help us to sense, relate, and imagine otherwise than what is allowed, encouraged, and rewarded within modernity.

## Exercise

To what extent are you afraid of disillusionment? To what extent can you relate to the world beyond filters of knowledge, identity, and understanding? To what extent are you willing to try to decenter, disarm, and dethrone the ego? How do you intend to interrupt the modern/colonial desire to feel connected with the flowers, trees, whales, the moon and stars, but not with the saturated “shit”? What are you prepared to lose or let go of in order to go deeper? Do you have an understanding companion in this journey or a supportive community to assist you?

Tool 7: Co-sensing with Radical Tenderness

Radical tenderness[^14] is a practice inspired by the artistic practice of Dani d’Emilia[^15] that consists of a series of exercises and a collaborative text we wrote together, “Co-sensing[^16] with Radical Tenderness,”[^17] is based on the (un)learning process of the Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures (GTDF) collective.

# Part 2  
Hospicing Modernity

  

# 1  
A Single Story of “Forward”

Within modernity, we are socialized to understand imagination as something that is individual and boundless. However, our ways of imagining are bound by collective referents of reality and these referents restrict what is possible for us to imagine. Modernity’s single story of “forward” is one of these referents. In this chapter I invite you to consider how our collective imagination has been curtailed by modernity. I offer a few stories from my research in the field of education, as examples of how modernity defines what we can imagine when we think about relationships between rich and poor countries.

I have spent the past twenty years researching how modernity’s promises and ideals are reproduced in educational processes across the world. I have examined modernity’s imprints on school textbooks, teacher education, educational policies, and in the work of civil society organizations.[^1] In these research projects, I have examined representations of inequality, poverty, wealth, development, knowledge, culture, and social change. My research has consistently shown that most of the _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira and narratives of inequality, cultural difference, sustainability, and globalization that circulate in education tend to be at best misleading, and at worst grossly demeaning. These representations distort perceptions of global issues, and limit the scope of possibilities for local and international ethical engagements and for global change. In particular, these representations often lead to the promotion of simplistic solutions to complex problems; paternalistic engagements with historically marginalized populations; and ethnocentric ideals of sustainability, justice, and change.

In the first ten years, my research was mostly conducted with schools and NGOs whose programs centered around the concept and practice of global citizenship education. I wanted to observe how and to what educational ends this concept was used, and to document the paradoxes I found in these educational processes.[^2] My idea was never to define what global citizenship should be and impose it universally, but to work with it as an interesting living story and to see what this story could do differently in different contexts. My interest in global citizenship education started in a project of the British Council in 1999. This project’s results showed me that hierarchies between cultures and peoples were intimately tied to a single story of progress, development, and human evolution that modernity likes to tell. In this chapter I reflect on what this period has taught me about how education is implicated in reproducing the harms of this single story, and how to start conversations about that with people working in formal and informal education.

Since this chapter refers to global relations, I should note that, in the field of international development, there is an ancient and ongoing debate about the terms used to classify countries. For over thirty years, critics have been trying to make visible the power dynamics involved in labeling. Questions about who decides the labels, in whose name, and for whose benefit have become really important in this field. For example, the use of terms such as _developed, developing, less developed,_ and _underdeveloped_ to refer to countries’ perceived stage of economic development has been heavily criticized for reproducing a single ideal of development that more powerful nations impose on less powerful ones.

The terms _first, second,_ and _third worlds_—which emerged during the cold war to refer to the capitalist bloc, the communist bloc, and the nonaligned nation-states[^3]—are also problematic and out of date. This is partly because they have come to imply a competitive race, where everyone wants to be “first,” which takes us back to limiting ideals of modern development. The terms _majority_ and _minority worlds_ have been proposed as replacements emphasizing that the rules of the game of development are set by a small number of countries, based on the interests of a small number of people, for the rest of the world to follow.

The terms _global north_ and _south_ emerged in the context of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and also carry problematic connotations, but I will use mostly these terms in this chapter to refer to low- and high-income countries. The pedagogical advantage of these terms is that the metaphor they evoke can be further complexified. For example, we can use the term _the south of the north_ to refer to poorer people in richer countries, the term _the north of the south_ to refer to richer people in poorer countries, the term _the north of the north_ to refer to the richest people in the richer countries, and the term the _south of the south_ to refer to the poorest people in the poorest countries.

In addition, I should say that while most people believe that rich countries support poorer countries in their “development,” there is ample empirical evidence showing that it is the other way around.[^4] Most of the wealth of countries in the global north comes from and is sustained by historical and systemic processes of exploitation, resource extraction, land-grabbing, unfair trade, enforced debt, and tied aid. Modernity hides the costs of modern development so that we can continue to buy it and enjoy it as a goal.[^5]

Meanwhile, countries in the global north export their brand of development as a means of social mobility to people in the global south who can afford it. In terms of flows of resources and people from the global south to the global north, education is an interesting case study. The international education brand EduCanada, for example, brings more revenue to Canada than the export of aluminum, helicopters, airplanes, and spacecraft. This chapter explores the common patterns and dynamics through which these problematic relationships are reproduced and invisibilized in education. It also presents frameworks and strategies to make those visible.

Global North–South Relations

In 1999, after eight years as a K–12 teacher in the state of Paraná, in the south of Brazil, I left the classroom to become a project coordinator for the British Council office in my state. My first job was to coordinate a program aiming to connect Brazilian and British State–funded schools for partnerships involving teacher and student exchanges around projects that should be: 1) sustainable in the long term, 2) mutually educational, and 3) focused on global citizenship. This followed a government initiative to get every school in the UK linked to a school in a “developing country.” My first task was to participate in a school principals’ conference in the UK promoting the school linking program. It was my first time traveling abroad.

There was a great deal of interest in Brazil at the conference and I had the opportunity to ask many principals why they would like to link their school with a Brazilian school, and what they would like to see as the partnerships’ educational outcomes. I was surprised by the general response of British principals who wanted to connect with a school “out in the sticks,” preferably in the middle of the Amazon forest and without running water. When asked about the reasons for that request, the common answer was that these principals wanted UK students to know how fortunate and privileged their lives were in contrast to the lives of Brazilian students. When I asked the principals what they thought this could mean educationally for Brazilian teachers and schools, the overwhelming response was that I should not worry because, as a gesture of “reciprocity” the UK schools would collect and send old books, computers, shoes, and clothes to the Brazilian schools.

I found three deeply problematic assumptions in this context, but I did not have the words to express that at that time. The first assumption was that by being exposed to the relative poverty of the schools in Brazil, the UK students would better appreciate the opportunities they could access in their countries (the poverty in Brazil was being framed and consumed as a way to address apathy and alienation in the UK context). The second assumption was that the Brazilian schools could be used as a means for the UK students to connect more personally with their textbook content and be more motivated to learn, especially in terms of accessing firsthand data about the Amazon forest (the Brazilian schools were expected to become “live content” for the UK students to study). The third assumption was that UK students could boost their sense of agency and empowerment by “making a difference” to the unfortunate students in the Brazilian school (“charity” toward the Brazilian students was being used to elevate the self-esteem of the UK students). I felt really disturbed by these assumptions, but back then I did not have the language I have now to articulate why.

Back in Brazil, my next task was to have a similar meeting with a group of Brazilian principals and teachers who had also expressed interest in the program. I had prepared a set of questions, naively hoping this group would help me articulate the problem I encountered in the UK. I asked the group why they wanted to link their school in Brazil with a UK school, and what they wanted to see as this partnership’s educational outcome. The Brazilian educators were all too happy to join the program. They said it would be great for their schools to be associated with a “first world” country, for students to learn firsthand what it meant to be “developed,” and what they should aspire to. There was a quick discussion amongst teachers about whether this should be a personal or collective aspiration (e.g., for individual social mobility through economic migration or national modernization). In that group, there was no question about the desirability of setting “first world” parameters as the universal measure for progress and development. When I asked if they saw any problem with this response, their reply was that there was indeed a problem of inequality. They felt that since their schools were underfunded, the UK schools should share their resources by sending old books and computers to Brazil.

I was left in a very awkward position. As a project manager, if I saw schools as just stakeholders, my job would be easy since partners in the global north and south agreed with each other, and the program’s success seemed secure. The partnerships could be sustainable, schools in each country would be learning from one another what they wanted to learn, and their notion of global citizenship determining a hierarchy of global leaders and global followers was compatible and mutually agreed upon. The single story of progress, development, and human evolution was naturalized on _both_ sides.

Although from a project manager’s perspective I had nothing to worry about, as an educator I could not sleep for several nights. What kept me awake was a sense of accountability to the students and the consequence of their carrying and spreading this single story in the world. From that point on, I became deeply interested in this story. I wanted to know where this story had started, how it had become so prevalent, how it could be made visible so that it could be questioned and perhaps interrupted, and what could be the long-term implications of reproducing or interrupting this story for students and society in general. I also wanted to know how and why humanity had been divided between those perceived as capable, normal, intelligent human beings heading humanity, enthroned and entitled to be global leaders; while others were told the opposite—and believed it! I wanted to examine and expose the mythology that sustained, normalized, and naturalized this story and to understand why we have held on to these constructs for so long despite the observable and tangible violence that they create. These questions (and many others) have occupied me ever since.

Initially I felt shocked and betrayed by the fact that none of these questions had been asked during my formal education in Brazil—even as I worked toward the university degree that trained me as a schoolteacher. For a while I followed a few loose leads as to why that might have been the case, but at one point I finally began to be able to articulate the problem I initially had so few words for: formal mass schooling as we know it was created precisely to naturalize and to normalize the single story, and it was extremely effective in doing so.

## Exercise

Pause. Check your bus.[^6] Observe if there are conversations between different passengers or if there are any passengers who want to be heard. Do not invest emotionally, just witness. Take a break, perhaps go for a short walk and reflect on how your socialization within modernity has imprinted the single story of progress, development, and human evolution in your unconscious, on different passengers of your bus. What emotional reactions come up for the passengers who are at the front of your bus? Who is driving your bus? To what extent is the driver invested in the single story? Try to identify a passenger who wants to justify why progress and development are necessary despite their costs. What is this passenger afraid of losing? What emotional reactions could be at the back of the bus, away from the driver?

Global Leaders and Global Followers

As I started my research in global citizenship education, I found that in most schools and NGOs there were few people troubled by the same issues I had identified, and who, like me, found it difficult to articulate the problems to colleagues, managers, and funding agencies. I began to receive numerous invitations to deliver professional development workshops and seminars aiming to start difficult conversations about organizational patterns that were problematic and potentially harmful to communities, but that were accepted as normal and desirable in the field. “Their” professional development very quickly became “my” professional development as I had to find ways to safely and effectively communicate triggering topics that problematized their self-image as benevolent protagonists of a story of “good people making a difference in the world.” I felt I needed to learn pedagogical acrobatics to communicate things effectively, to support people in sitting with the discomfort of their complicity in causing harm without feeling defensive or insulted; and supporting them in seeing that—although there is no quick fix for the issues—there are steps that can be taken to reduce harm. It was (and still is) really hard.

Right from the beginning, I noticed that many people avoided the topic if it was approached logically and directly (e.g., with hard data). I observed built-in resistance in our cognitive and affective circuits that rendered questioning modernity counterintuitive and uncomfortable. This in turn generated defensive responses when people were prompted to interrogate the normalized thoughts, relationships, policies, and practices that they held in high esteem—whose upkeep promised them high reward in the form of social and professional status, positive self-image, or national identity. As soon as I was able to identify this deep-rooted resistance, I decided to try something different. Instead of forefronting rational arguments, I started introducing potentially sensitive and difficult topics through metaphors.

For example, at the beginning of seminars and workshops with teachers or NGO practitioners, I would invite them to imagine a field of corn, and to harvest and display the corn on the ground. I would then show a picture of corncobs from Peru in a multitude of colors,[^7] and ask participants if what they saw in the picture resembled their imagined harvest. The vast majority of educators who did this exercise could only imagine yellow corncobs, as they had never been exposed to multicolored varieties. There are economic and political reasons why yellow corn is the dominant (or only) type of corn most people know. Through this exercise, the imagined harvest of yellow corn became a multilayered metaphor that I used to convey two main points to participants: how the exercise showed the limits of what is possible for us to imagine, and how the exercise could help us understand the dynamics of north–south relations.

The omnipresence of the yellow corn was used as an analogy for the single story of progress, development, and human evolution that normalizes “yellow corn” social ideals in relation to health, education, governance, justice, work ethics, relationships, and identity building, while rendering other possibilities unimaginable. I wanted to draw attention to how this omnipresence limits our imagination, and creates what Boaventura de Sousa Santos calls “abyssal thinking”[^8]: the omnipresence and alleged universality of the yellow corn defines what is legitimate and what is worthy, while hiding that it also defines what is thinkable and erases what is unthinkable (i.e., the multicolored corncobs).

When the yellow corncob is the only imaginable and desirable variety of corn, the multicolored corncobs are perceived as either nonexistent or a less developed and lesser value version of the universally desirable variety. In other words, the problem is not related to most people not knowing that multicolored varieties of corn exist (as an effect of ignorance), but to the omnipresence and value attached to the yellow corncobs (as an effect of universalism), curtailing our imagination and preventing us from even imagining the existence of other possibilities. This is one of the ways that modernity colonizes both physical and imaginative landscapes.

Using a picture of yellow corncobs representing dominant assumptions about a supposedly universal social contract, I contrasted the value attributed to yellow and multicolored corn in relation to perceived contributions to the single story of progress, development, and human evolution told by modernity. In this story, yellow corncobs are perceived to be heading humanity, while multicolored corncobs are perceived to lag behind. This contrast reflects how the world has been divided[^9] between those who fit the imposed universal parameters of civilization of modernity, and those who are perceived as representing a burden to the advancement of this ideal of civilization. This contrast also illustrates how the narratives of progress and development that are presented in the media and in textbooks—and that are internalized by viewers, educators, and students—sell deeply problematic _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira that distort the issues and limit the scope of relations and possibilities. In those _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira, those in the “developed world” are represented as intelligent, benevolent, clean, capable, deserving, and entitled to leadership and to dispense rights;[^10] while those in the “developing world” are constructed in deficit and pathologizing terms such as inadequate, ignorant, unsanitary, violent, helpless, and lacking knowledge, information, manners, work ethics, education, and rights.[^11]

As an example of this relational pattern in the construction of self and other, consider a question that was part of a government survey used with high school students in the UK, which I also shared in these workshops. The options the students had to choose from for their response illustrated the reproduction of this relational construction.[^12]

Question: “How can poorer countries affect us in the UK?”

1. by getting us involved in their conflicts
2. by increasing risks of diseases spreading in the UK
3. by increasing the number of people who want to live here
4. by affecting our jobs and our economy
5. by damaging the earth’s environment
6. by making our foreign holidays more dangerous

The options that the survey offered the students reproduce and reinforce assumptions of deficit, inadequacy, and pathology (of the other) that justify and rationalize entitlements grounded on assumptions of superiority (of the self) that are integral to the single story, such as:

1. the other (elsewhere) as violent, the self (in the UK) as peaceful
2. the other as pathological, the self as healthy but at risk of being contaminated
3. the other as undeserving, the self as deserving
4. the other as opportunistic, threatening the social mobility of the self
5. the other as irresponsible, the self as responsible
6. the other threatening the perceived entitlement of the self to safe holidays abroad

    ## Exercise
    
    Pause. Check your bus. Observe if there are any conversations between different passengers. Do not invest emotionally, just witness. Ground yourself in this moment. How do you feel about reproducing consciously and unconsciously the divisions of the world described in this passage (hint: we all do it)? Try to spot passengers on your bus who are a little irritated by this exercise and want to rationalize their innocence. Try to find passengers who believe that their imagination has not been curtailed by modernity. Reflect on what insecurities could be behind their affective investments in seeing themselves or in being validated by others as virtuous, righteous, or blameless. Pay attention to passengers who place a high value on Western education and who could be arguing that the benefits of education outweigh its harms.[^13] Remind these passengers that while we export Western schooling all over the world, in North America alone more than three million families opt out of formal schooling to offer their children something more relevant according to their own judgment (this includes deschooling, unschooling, and alternative education).

Helping Others to “Catch Up”

Another focus of my research was on initiatives in schools and NGOS that meant to “help” poorer countries in the global south to “catch up” with countries in the global north. When I started looking into this issue, critical analyses of north–south relations based on the desire to help were extremely rare. However, in the last ten years there has been a significant increase in research in this area that problematizes paternalism[^14] and charity—in particular, the tropes of the white savior,[^15] celebrity philanthropy,[^16] poverty porn,[^17] and voluntourism[^18] have come under heavy scrutiny and critique in many academic disciplines and professional fields.

When I started, I decided to examine representations of poverty, wealth, culture, knowledge, and “the way forward” in materials used in NGOs and schools—as well as policies related to global education. I was particularly interested in the connections made (or not) between the creation of poverty and the accumulation of wealth. In the vast majority of materials I examined at the time, poverty was represented as a lack of resources caused by a “curse of geography” coupled with a lack of skills, education, or work ethic of the poor themselves. Conversely, the accumulation of wealth was often presented as an aspirational goal associated with hard work, creativity, and educational credentials. Historical and systemic analyses that connected colonialism, imperialism, wars/militarization, slavery, or racism with the creation of poverty and the accumulation of wealth were absent from most educational materials and policies promoting this mode of north–south relations.

Apart from written materials, I also researched north–south initiatives focused on global citizenship and sustainable development, like the school linking program described above. In these initiatives, sustainable development was unambiguously associated with becoming modern. It should thus come as no surprise that the single story of progress, development, and human evolution was mobilized as the single aspirational goal in these international engagements as well. Critiques of mainstream development (which are abundant in the literature), proposals of alternative development, or alternatives to development[^19] were never mentioned in the materials.

I was also interested in how notions of culture and knowledge were mobilized in policies and projects. “Other” cultures were usually presented and perceived as having values, traditions, and beliefs, but never knowledge of universal worth. These values, traditions, and beliefs could be curious, absurd, or entertaining—adding “color” to the curriculum. This reinforced a transactional relationship in north–south exchanges where the “other” was supposed to offer “culture” packaged for easy consumption (e.g., drumming, culinary, or dance lessons) in return for receiving knowledge of universal value (e.g., technology, math, English). Needless to say, there was also an expectation of displays of gratitude on the part of the recipients of this knowledge of universal worth. It was interesting that, in many educational policy documents, the word _culture_ was also only used to refer to what “others” have: since knowledge of universal worth is neutral and objective, those who possess it were perceived not to have a specific “culture” per se.

As a way to summarize these and other problematic patterns of representation and engagement that I identified in north–south relations in education, I created a checklist that became a popular tool in the field. It is called HEADS UP. The acronym HEADS UP stands for:

- Hegemonic practices (reinforcing and justifying the status quo)
- Ethnocentric projections (presenting one view as universal and superior)
- Ahistorical thinking (forgetting the role of historical legacies and complicities in shaping current problems)
- Depoliticized orientations (disregarding the impacts of power inequalities and delegitimizing dissent)
- Self-serving motivations (invested in self-congratulatory heroism)
- Uncomplicated solutions (offering “feel-good” quick fixes that do not address root causes of problems)
- Paternalistic projections (infantilizing the other and seeking gratitude from those who have been “helped”)

The expanded HEADS UP tool (see table 2, below) was designed to support conversations about unexamined assumptions in partnerships and collaborations between dominant and marginalized populations, which could be the global north and south or another north and south particular to a geopolitical context.

This checklist tool took on a life of its own as NGO practitioners started to use it to identify and attempt to interrupt problematic tendencies in their institutions, promotional materials, and international partnerships. Doing this is an extremely difficult task, since these patterns are not understood as problematic by most institutions, funders, or the general public. Looking only at the cognitive layer, if the HEADS UP patterns are challenged all at once, the resulting narrative can become largely unintelligible to the general public or to funding agencies, which means initiatives that challenge HEADS UP can lose their funding and credibility. The obvious implication of this is that the more critical, well-thought-out projects that try to be mindful of (or address) more than just one set of the problematic patterns rarely, if ever, get funded, because the funders simply might not understand what the project is trying to achieve and how. By observing how practitioners wanted to use the tool to prompt organizational change, I started to look deeper into the difficulties of interrupting these patterns.

For example, I started looking into how the HEADS UP patterns are tied up to affective and relational investments related to the single story of progress, development, and human evolution. For many people, this story provides an important sense of direction, purpose, virtue, and agency. The story is also the basis for our collective hope in prosperity. For individuals, it is also associated with social status and social validation. If we are cognitively, affectively, and relationally wired to this story, this cannot be interrupted through critique (or the intellect) alone. The reproduction of the HEADS UP patterns is affirmed and rewarded in most social relations: they make people feel good and look good. They also give people a sense of hope and of moving forward, where they are the ones guiding humanity to a better place, and justifying their privilege with their benevolence and purpose.

Efforts to interrupt these patterns also tend to create paradoxes, where a solution to one problem creates another problem or even a chain of problems. This creates a circularity in which efforts to interrupt harm can actually end up producing more harm. For example, attempts to challenge hegemony can create other entrenched hegemonies as a form of resistance; attempts to challenge ethnocentrism can fall into absolute relativism; attempts to challenge ahistoricism can also revert to a reactive single narrative of history; attempts to address depoliticization can hijack political agendas to specific ends; attempts to challenge self-congratulatory initiatives can crush generosity and altruism; and attempts to interrupt paternalistic relations can also cancel important opportunities for short-term redistribution. Interrupting the workings of modernity within modernity is complex, complicated, and deeply frustrating. That is why stamina, humor, flexibility, and resilience are required for those who want to do this work in the long haul.

## Exercise

Take a short break. Check your bus. Observe if there are any conversations between different passengers. Do not invest emotionally, just witness. Count three deep breaths. Reflect on how you have encountered the HEADS UP patterns in your education, work, religious practice, social media, or family socialization. How are the HEADS UP patterns challenged and/or reproduced in your context? What paradoxes have you observed in initiatives that attempt to challenge these patterns? Are there any passengers on your bus who are irritated by the HEADS UP patterns or the tool itself? Sit with these passengers for a while. What are the fears and desires behind their responses? Read the “Declaration of Decolonization” by Manish Jain, below, and try to identify how the declaration attempts to challenge the HEADS UP patterns described in this section.

> I can no longer accept a narrative of education, which teaches me that my village grandmother was illiterate, primitive, backward, stupid, uneducated, underdeveloped, uncivilized, and not capable of managing their own affairs.

> I can no longer accept a narrative of education that standardizes, sorts, brands, and condemns millions of beautiful brilliant talented children around the world as “failures,” “problems,” and “slow learners,” and uses certification as a tool for denying people access to future learning and working opportunities.

> I can no longer accept a narrative of education that teaches us that the “head” is more important than the heart, the hands, and home.

> I can no longer accept a narrative of education that sees my links to my land, to my local languages, to my seeds, to my rivers, to my trees, to my histories and herstories, to my body, to my inner voice, to the spirit world, to my community all as a barrier to modernization and development that must at best be destroyed if we are to progress, and at worst be condemned to a multicultural day festival in school.

> I can no longer accept a narrative of education that teaches me that physical work in the fields, in my home, and in my community is drudgery and my children’s definition of “happiness” lies in drinking Coca-Cola, eating at McDonald’s, using Fair and Lovely face whitening creams, and chatting on Facebook.

> I can no longer accept a narrative of education that teaches me that I have to compete against others in my community and against peoples from other countries to survive.

> I can no longer accept a narrative that teaches me that learning is a commodity (along with the air, water, land, food) and that knowledge is the property of individuals through copyrights and patents.

> I can no longer accept a narrative of education that teaches me that we are poor in education because we don’t have schools, trained teachers, or scientific knowledge. So we need more foreign direct investment, we need more foreign aid, we need more public–private partnerships, we need more free trade agreements, and we need to always trust the experts over the wisdom of our communities.

> I can no longer accept a narrative that gives power to the “Ministry of Human Resources” to define what it means to be human.

Self-Serving Altruism

When offering professional development to practitioners working for charitable organizations, I had to start with exercises that interrupted the expectations for easy quick fixes that were often imposed on this type of work. The general idea is that if you raise a problem, it is your responsibility to provide the solution, so that we can all “move forward,” which is modernity itself restricting the range of responses that are possible again. I had to find a way to quickly deactivate these projections and to show that the demand for simple formulas and quick fixes, as much as we have been conditioned to crave them, was restricting our capacity to sit with the depth and the difficulty of the problem.

For example, when working with child-sponsoring organizations, I was often asked if the critiques presented in my work would immediately benefit the people who were most vulnerable and in urgent need of assistance in the global south. Given the emotional charge of the question (denoting a competition to see whose work could be more valuable) and accusation implicit in it (of my work not being as valuable as sponsoring a child); responding to this question through logic, with reference to the complicity of these organizations in the creation of the vulnerability and poverty they wanted to address was not an option. Thus, again, offering a response through an image was my safest bet.

For this particular context, I invited NGO practitioners working in these organizations to imagine that they were walking along the banks of a river and that suddenly they saw a group of children drowning. Next, I asked how many tasks there were in relation to “helping” the children. The group would usually focus on getting the children who were drowning out of the water. I would then ask them to imagine that they looked up the river and saw several boats where people were throwing many more children in the water. Then I asked how many jobs there would be once the boats became visible.

I wanted to emphasize that while saving children from drowning was absolutely important, there were at least three other equally important jobs that needed to be done: stopping the people on the boats throwing the children in the water; examining why the people on the boats were engaged in this violent behavior; and documenting the different stories in this scenario, including the stories of the children who did not make it. I also invited practitioners to consider where they and their organizations were located in this picture. Finally, as part of this exercise, I also emphasized that it was very possible for someone to be on the boat, trying to rescue the children with one hand, while throwing children out of the boat with the other hand.

The offer of “help” in these charitable organizations is based on the idea that people in other places would not be able to get by without modernity’s theoretical, practical, or cultural achievements.[^20] The urgency to “move forward” with the program of modernity prevents people from sitting with the ways modernity paradoxically creates the problems it tries to address, and motivates people to seek simplistic solutions: to treat the symptoms rather than address the much more complex systemic causes of poverty. This includes the fact that those in a position to dispense help benefit from what creates poverty and are complicit in modernity’s continuous violence and unsustainability.

In the image of the children drowning in the river, the trope of urgency is extremely present as a demand of modernity, and part and parcel of what has been called the “savior industrial complex,”[^21] which sells the consumption of self-serving and simplistic solutions to world problems that make people feel and look good and that give them a sense of “moving forward.” The charitable organizations also reflected modernity’s demands for certainty, authority, predictability, value, intelligibility, and “progress.” There were clear expectations that those who wanted to “help” should be validated as good and virtuous people (better than those who did nothing), be recognized for their altruistic efforts, and not to be criticized—especially by someone (like me) coming from a culture or country considered to be “less advanced” and seen as benefiting from their charitable efforts.

It is hard to convey the degree to which the global north derives its wealth from the global south while presenting itself as an altruistic “helper.” The sculpture _Justitia: the Goddess of Justice,_ by Jens Galschiøt tries to communicate this idea with reference to the savior complex. The sculpture portrays a large naked older European woman sitting on the back of a small starved Black young man. The woman is carrying the scales of justice, but has her eyes closed, denoting hypocrisy. Her statement illustrates the self-serving aspect of her relationship with the starving Black young man: “I’m sitting on the back of a man. He is sinking under the burden. I would do anything to help him, except stepping down from his back.” This sculpture was created as a representation of the exploitative and extractive nature of the creation and distribution of wealth in north–south relationships, and the hypocrisy of the global north in efforts to “help” the global south.

Galschiøt’s sculpture is both useful and deeply problematic. Although European women like the one portrayed in the picture have undoubtedly sustained racial and colonial relations,[^22] by portraying a white woman as a symbol of oppression the statue erases the central role of patriarchy in labor exploitation and sexual and gender violence. The image also draws attention away from the patriarchy at work with the fat-shaming depiction of the woman. Therefore, when using this image to illustrate exploitative relations and self-serving charitable or “development” interventions, I problematize the sculpture and present a contrasting image that replaces the white woman with an elegant white man in a suit sitting on the shoulders of a disproportionately smaller nonwhite woman from the global south gagged by a piece of cloth. The slim handsome man with movie-star looks is taking a selfie with his cell phone, drinking fair trade organic coffee, and wearing expensive noise-canceling headphones. This image may be more accurate in the depiction of our systemic complicity in the creation of poverty: how even “ethical” modern ideals are still implicated in the reproduction of violence and unsustainability.

When I present both _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira, I ask people to count and name the injustices in the scene—both immediate injustices and injustices by implication—and to trace them historically and systemically. For example, the division of labor between the north and south can be traced back to colonial and imperial processes and to the exploitative accumulation of capital; the scales in the first image could represent the imposition of a definition of justice and control by legal institutions with double standards; the paradox in the statement of the person being carried shows the insincerity of forms of altruism enabled precisely by the injustices they claim to address. It is also important to draw people’s attention to the fact that normalized standards of beauty and virtue also create and reinforce modernity’s hierarchies of worth.

The sculpture can be a useful tool to start conversations about the denial of complicity in systemic harm, and unsustainability within modernity. However, for most people invested in modernity, facing the facts of violence and unsustainability of modernity (i.e., colonialism, imperialism, expropriation, ecocides, unfair trade, etc.) can trigger defensiveness that deflects responsibility. For example, some people might say that they cannot see how their personal choices are in any way connected with structural inequalities. Some may be put off by feeling blamed or shamed for the things they enjoy. Some would say that although modernity is imperfect, it is the best system we have come up with so far. Some will even say that it is dangerous and irresponsible to critique modernity without offering solutions or alternatives, or to push too fast and too far. Some will doubt the veracity of critical claims, thinking that if things were that bad, surely someone would have done something about it. Others will perceive the critique as an attempt to dictate their thinking. Even those who acknowledge that modernity is fundamentally harmful and unsustainable might say that unless there is something they can immediately do about it, examining the flaws of our current system can only lead to apathy, anxiety, and depression.

In education, we tend not to talk about the hidden violence and costs of the promises of the current system because it is neither easy nor convenient to do so. Talking about it is uncomfortable and frustrating, can prompt feelings of hopelessness and anger, can make us look in the mirror and see something we don’t want to see, and can make us enjoy less the things that are pleasurable if we don’t think about where they come from and at what and whose expense. Indeed, if given a choice, many people would choose to continue not to think about these things and to keep enjoying these pleasures and comforts uninterrupted. However, when these pleasures and comforts may be affecting the very possibility of the continuity of life on the planet, we need to consider our responsibility toward future generations of human and nonhuman lives.

Part of us already knows we are in a huge mess, but because we do not know what to do or how to sit with this knowledge, we tend to evade thinking about it. We prefer to avoid facing the facts out of fear that we will feel groundless and overwhelmed with anxiety and grief. However, unless we find a way to face this systemic shit together and learn to compost it collaboratively and to transform it into new soil, we will drown in it collectively. While guilt, shame, and worthlessness are traps to be avoided, if we want to address the violence and unsustainability of modernity, there is no way around facing our complicity in social and ecological harm.

## Exercise

Pause. Pay attention to your sense of smell. Yes, you read that right. What scents can you identify around you? The olfactory systems of those of us living in metropolitan areas are often saturated with familiar smells and desensitized to the olfactory functions we have relied upon before. Think about how dogs use their noses to compute information and affective states, for example. We may also have the capacity to do a version of that, but this capacity may have been numbed in modern contexts or we are just no longer consciously registering the information it generates. Also interesting is how the sense of smell works with memory. See if you can recall the scent of one of your grandparents. What scene does that scent bring with it? Now pay attention to the undertones of that scent and how that works on your body, perhaps bringing up other sensations. Try to recall the scents of urgency and the scent of the global poverty that sustains the global wealth accumulation that we benefit from. Check your bus. Try to identify passengers who want to avoid being implicated in the creation of poverty; passengers who want to be seen as innocent and good; passengers who want quick and final solutions; passengers who don’t want to feel guilty, shameful, or worthless; passengers who want to be validated as being “better than” other people who don’t know, do, or care as much as they do. What could these passengers be missing out on?

Mapping Horizons of Possibility

Through many years I have participated in numerous gatherings where people come together to discuss social and global change. I have observed that in such gatherings those who are invested in the continuity of modernity as a horizon of hope seem to manifest certain common patterns. One of these patterns is the tendency to speak as if their theory of change is universally relevant and adopted by everyone in the room, and to assume that the terms and definitions they use will be interpreted and used in the same way by other people. This tends to cause confusion, and sometimes unnecessary conflicts. A simple educational intervention is to raise awareness of how language is ambivalent, how our interpretations are grounded in cultural referents that are not universally shared, and how the desire to word the world prevents us from acknowledging that words cannot index reality in a permanent way. This realization can go a long way in inviting people to speak with relational rigor: in more tentative and self-reflexive ways.

In very general terms, a theory of change consists of at least four parts: the identification of a problem, the analysis of the nature of this problem, a vision/projection for how the larger improvement or transformation of this problem can take place, and a proposition for the next steps to be taken toward that vision/projection. However, someone could agree with your identification of the problem and propose a different analysis of its nature or a different vision of change; and someone could also use the same words you use with widely different meanings. Thus, meta-analytical tools that map the ways we approach change can be useful in inviting people to exercise self-reflexivity in relation to their own theories of change and in relation to how they share their theories of change in conversations with others.

For example, responses to contemporary global crises vary according to different analyses of existing and ideal roles played by the different dimensions of modernity and of wealth, science, and technology.[^1] One basic way of mapping these debates is to establish a distinction between those who think modernity is defensible and those who think it is not. On the one hand, those who defend modernity believe it has provided the most secure, safe, and equitable system thus far and can be: 1) improved and expanded as it is, or 2) fixed with better policies. On the other hand, those who believe that modernity is unsustainable and unethical suggest that either: 3) we need and can immediately create new systems, or 4) that genuinely new systems will only be possible once the old systems have become impossible.

Each perspective presents different ideas for the way forward, for example, in alignment with the four possible analyses presented immediately above: 1) entrepreneurship and innovation for market expansion; 2) more effective citizen participation and expanded trust in representational democracy in order to create better policies toward more inclusive, equitable, and green economic growth; 3) degrowth, community autonomy, energy self-sufficiency, food sovereignty, and solidarity and circular economies; or 4) palliative care for a dignified death for the old system and assistance with the gestation and birth of new, potentially wiser systems. The GTDF collective has created several social maps that chart these responses in detail in different contexts, two of which are presented in this chapter.[^2]

Soft-, Radical-, and Beyond-Reform Orientations of Change

The first social map[^3]—shown in figure 1 (page 91)—makes a distinction between 1) soft reform of modernity, 2) radical reform of modernity, and 3) modernity beyond reform. This social map examines cognitive and relational orientations to modernity focusing on inclusion and aspirations for institutional and systemic change. This social map has been useful to show how people operate from different orientations to institutional spaces, and the importance of holding space for the contradictions and paradoxes within and between different understandings and aspirations. Many practitioners who engaged with this social map reported a sense of relief after having the opportunity to understand how their perspective was interpreted from another set of assumptions and aspirations. This usually helped explain the reasons behind the institutional resistance and pushback they encountered, often the source of much frustration—especially if they are left unexamined due to a lack of time or appropriate language.

### Soft-Reform Orientation

Approaches to change within modernity articulated from within the soft-reform space focus on changing policy and practice, and on including traditionally marginalized populations into existing institutions. Social injustice is primarily diagnosed as a problem of exclusion from access to the gifts of modern societies, including: social mobility offered by capitalism; order and belonging offered by nation-states; universal reason and values offered by Western humanism and Enlightenment knowledge traditions; as well as autonomy, authority, and possessive individualism offered by the separation of humans from the earth and from one another.

The theory of change orienting soft reform is one of methodological adjustments in institutional settings. The idea is that the systems and structures we inhabit are structurally sound, but the way that we engage them requires updating our practices to ensure continuous improvements in efficiency and effectiveness. While difference is not entirely elided, inclusion is conditional upon assent to a horizon of hope oriented by shared goals and coherence around continued support for existing social, political, and economic norms.[^4] The ideal here is to incorporate forms of “difference that make no difference,” as those who are included are meant to be smoothly absorbed and assimilated into existing institutions, and to show deference and gratitude toward those who included them. Alternative possibilities for organizing relationships and resources that challenge these norms are delegitimized or deemed illegible. Therefore, the only possible proposition is to expand access to existing institutions.

### Radical-Reform Orientation

In contrast to the soft-reform space, the radical-reform space identifies social injustice as a product of exclusionary representation and inadequate redistribution—which then translates into questions about not only what we do in modern institutions (i.e., methodological concerns), but also how and why we do it (i.e., epistemological concerns). This diagnosis of injustice understands that oppression and marginalization are by-products of modernity’s structures of domination. Thus, the proposition is that historical and systemic harms can be redressed only by radically restructuring social relations. However, critiques from this space tend to disarticulate and prioritize one or sometimes two dimensions of social injustice (e.g., capitalist dispossession, racism, cis-hetero-patriarchy, ableism, imposition of the liberal democratic nation-state form) rather than understanding their interconnections.

The horizon of hope in this space is one of targeting the modern mechanisms that produce enduring inequities with the intention to fundamentally remake modernity itself. Thus, it is hoped that making more space for different knowledges, peoples, and experiences, and reallocating resources to support their presence, will lead to the transformation of an institution/system—rather than absorbing them into an institution/system that would otherwise be unchanged. Proposed strategies for decolonization in this space therefore include empowerment, amplifying/centering the voices of marginalized subjects (i.e., substantive representation that goes beyond mere tokenism), and resource redistribution.

![[c02g001.png]]

Figure 1: Soft-, Radical-, and Beyond-Reform Map

### Beyond-Reform Orientation

The distinction between the radical- and the beyond-reform spaces is the recognition that the addition of other ways of knowing, and the redistribution of resources within existing institutions, will not in themselves be adequate to shift the underlying violent and unsustainable infrastructures of the modern/colonial system. Soft- and radical-reform spaces can be interpreted as placing modernity on life support—regardless of the costs or consequences—while beyond-reform spaces move modernity into palliative care. In the beyond-reform space, social injustice is understood not merely as a matter of unequal resources or exclusionary ways of knowing, but rather as the condition of possibility for modern existence itself. Thus, colonialism is identified as the constitutive underside of modernity: inherently extractive, relationally unethical, and ecologically unsustainable—and therefore, modernity cannot be reformed.

From this perspective, adding multiple ways of knowing (epistemologies) onto the same modern way of being (ontology) will always be a limited and limiting strategy for interrupting colonial habits of being. This does not mean that immediate reforms to modern institutions—including redistribution and representation—are unimportant, but rather that ultimately these institutions cannot be reformed or redeemed, at least if the goal is to end colonial violence and unsustainability and enable different futures. It is important to note that beyond-reform work is virtually unthinkable in most institutions; therefore soft and radical reform are still important strategies for harm reduction. In other words, there is nothing wrong with doing soft or radical reform, as long as you are aware of the bigger picture (that this is not the endgame) and that you are doing your work with integrity, in ways that try to minimize harm for other people and the planet.

Theories of change rooted in this beyond-reform space are varied, but generally fall under one of three responses, each of which offers possibilities as well as limitations (and may be used in tandem): system walkout, hacking, or hospicing. Those who attempt to walk out of the modern system are generally seeking alternatives to modern systems and institutions, with guarantees. This might include, for example, efforts to develop or reclaim epistemologies or modes of social organization that have been actively repressed within modernity. While there is much to be learned from this work, when alternatives are engaged with a desire for guaranteed outcomes, this engagement may still be rooted in at least some colonial desires (e.g., for certainty, progress, innocence) and projective fantasies. In this case, these alternatives tend to be romanticized and their shortcomings and inevitable mistakes and contradictions are ignored. Further, the ability to choose whether to walk out should be understood in contrast to those who do not have the option because they are structurally excluded from the system to begin with, and subject to its most brutal violence (i.e., differences between high-intensity and low-intensity struggles[^5]).

Those who propose to hack modern institutions seek to redirect resources from within the system toward nurturing something else, whether that means educational efforts to identify those institutions’ limits, or to support other systems. This approach can be understood as “one foot in, one foot out,” requiring one to play the institution’s game while trying to bend the rules toward other ends. This is a risky endeavor, as it requires an existential disinvestment from typical institutional economies of merit and worth, while at the same time keeping the appearance that one is invested in institutional games (in order to be effective in bending the rules). Much good work can be done through this approach, but it is sometimes difficult to know when one is playing the system or being played by it. Further, some operating in this space may position themselves as outside of implication in the system (e.g., as heroic subverting agents) in ways that center individual resistance and fail to attend to structural complicity in harm.

The final beyond-reform proposition is what we have termed _hospicing,_ which recognizes the eventual inevitable end of modernity’s fundamentally unethical and unsustainable institutions, but sees the necessity of enabling a “good” death through which important lessons are processed. These lessons are learned through the accomplishments and mistakes of the dying system, so that they can be applied as we witness and help midwife the birth of something different. This approach also requires that we hospice our own investments in modernity’s promises not as a reactive rejection of modernity and attempt to control the terms of its dissolution, but rather as self-implicated processes of facing up to our own harmful desires and habits of being. At the interface between this death and birth is the imperative to walk steadily into and with the eye of the storm without knowing where it is headed: move either too fast or too slow and one gets swept up and thrown around violently in the vortex of change.

## Exercise

You may have found the above text very dense, and your mind and body may be asking you to take a break. If that is the case, I would suggest that you listen to their voice. A short pause or a longer break may be just what you need. Try placing your hands on your back and neck, feeling around for what your body may need in order to stay engaged with this in ways that are healthy for you. Do you need to stretch? Walk? Lie down for a bit? Go out or do a headstand? Whatever it is, I advise you to do it. While you are at it, or after doing it, go and visit the deck of your bus that represents the context of your work. On this deck you can find your individual passengers as well as those of your colleagues, including the ones you do not get on with. Where are most people at on this deck in relation to soft-reform, radical-reform, and beyond-reform spaces? Who wants to keep modernity in life support, no matter what, and who is prepared to move modernity into palliative care? Are there any conflicts emerging from divergent views in relation to what to do with modernity? Are there passengers who are anxious because they cannot articulate their views to other passengers?

Dying Olive Trees

My maiden name, which I use in this book, is Vanessa Machado de Oliveira, which means, literally, “Vanessa, the axe of the olive tree.” The surname “axe” comes from my Indigenous (Guaraní) grandmother. Like most Indigenous people of her time, she had her name registered officially later in life, and since Indigenous people did not use surnames, her surname was chosen by government officials—in her case, reflecting tools used in rural areas.[^6] The name Oliveira, or olive tree, is very common in Brazil. Historically, tree names were given to people who had to change their surnames due to persecution. In my German grandmother’s case, this was the surname of the man she had to marry and whose family had to flee Jewish persecution a few generations before. As I was growing up, my surname was the target of many jokes; therefore I changed it as soon as I could to something that would attract less attention. However, I never stopped paying attention to olive trees. Eventually, one of the _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira that showed up in my work was the image of an ancient olive tree representing modernity.

More than twenty-four hundred years ago, Plato taught his students under an ancient olive tree, which today would be almost three thousand years old. To me, there is something about modernity that is this ancient and, despite all its shortcomings, sacred. In 1976, the year I was born, a bus crashed into what was believed to be Plato’s tree in Greece. The trunk was damaged, but leaves still sprouted after the crash. In 2013, what was left of this ancient olive tree mysteriously disappeared from its site. Coincidently, also since 2013 in the Puglia region of Italy, a type of bacteria known as the “ebola of olive trees,” is causing thousands of ancient trees to die.

Puglia is the biggest producer of olive oil in Italy, and the region’s farmers, activists, and environmentalists are protesting government orders to destroy the trees to stop the infection. Many believe there is bad faith behind this olive tree catastrophe, involving pesticide makers such as Monsanto and BASF and foreign investors seeking to build vacation resorts in the region. An official investigation revealed that government authorities knew the olive trees were dying since 2004, but failed to respond immediately. Tens of thousands of olive trees have died or are dying and there is no known cure for the disease. The infection caused by the bacteria _Xylella fastidiosa_ spreads through bugs that feed on infected trees’ sap in the summer and then move around. Once infected, within months the trees begin to die: the bacteria invade the trees’ sap system, turning the leaves brown. In order to slow the death process, farmers need to cut the most greatly affected branches. I could not help but associate these incidents with modernity’s fortune.

The image of the olive tree representing modernity[^7] in figure 2 (page 96) illustrates how the ways we think about problems shape the questions we ask, and limit both our horizons of possibility and the scope of approaches we can take. The leaves and flowers of the tree represent ways of doing within modernity (a methodological layer); the branches represent ways of knowing, imagining, and evaluating legitimacy (the epistemological layer); and the roots and trunk represent the ways of being (the onto-metaphysical logical layer)—which includes ways of desiring, hoping, relating, and existing in the world. Each layer of analysis (methodological, epistemological, and ontological) addresses different dimensions of a problem of concern. In the description of each layer below, I have used education, international development, and social change to illustrate how each layer would offer different analyses and different interventions to these topics. I have also included examples of frequently asked questions for each layer.

![[c02g002.png]]

Figure 2: Modernity as an Olive Tree

### Ways of Doing: Leaves and Flowers (Methodological Layer)

Critiques that focus on ways of doing conclude that the system is not operating as it should—that is, at its optimum performance level—and thus must be adjusted in order to realign better with its underlying principles and goals (akin to the soft-reform orientation). Thus, a methodological critique emphasizes changing what and how we do something within an existing system to make it more effective on its own terms. Here the focus is on the leaves and flowers of the olive tree, and the emphasis is on maximizing the growth and functionality of the tree in order to more efficiently produce and improve outputs (i.e., olives). In relation to modernity, the assumption is that any problems we face are attributable to a failure of the existing system to live up to its underlying promises. These may include a lack of efficiency within capitalist markets, a lack of access to Enlightenment knowledge, and a lack of trust in a nation-state’s politicians or democratic processes.

Conversations about how to move forward are ultimately limited because there is only one viable direction for progress—in this case, the production of olives (the idea itself of “forward” is never questioned). This critique is driven by a desire to produce policies and practices that will support progress with predefined outcomes and goals beyond the scope of critique—which often includes the prestige, moral authority, and futurity of institutions, and hierarchies of knowledge and canonical influences. In this way, approaches emerging from methodological critiques seek to address contemporary problems using solutions internal to the system itself (asking the same questions, and giving predictable answers).

Approaches to education driven by methodological critiques tend to be invested in the universalization of (Western) schooling as the only form of legitimate education. Therefore, data about student performance across countries should be gathered and compared with a view to improve the delivery of knowledge deemed to be of universal worth. Meanwhile, approaches to international development will promote a single story of development as economic growth, assimilation, and social mobility as universally desirable outputs. This approach assumes the presumed supremacy and benevolence of the most powerful and wealthy “leaders” of the system (namely, Western nation-states), and the universal extension/adoption of their models for development elsewhere. Approaches to social change that adopt the methodological critique are characterized by confidence that the generation of new ideas, products, and processes will solve persistent gaps in inefficiency or equity of the current system, so that what it offers is accessible to all those considered to be deserving. Interventions in this realm assume that with more data and better information-harvesting tools we will be able to fix problems and create innovative methodologies that can help us move together to the same “forward” (i.e., we have different options on how to get there and we welcome recommendations, but the direction we are headed in is not up for debate).

Questions that might be asked at the methodological layer include: What is the problem? Who is affected? How can we fix it? How can I help? What should we do? How should we do it? What changes have people already tried to make, and what lessons can be learned from those efforts? What strategies are effective? What outcomes are expected? What challenges are faced? How will it work? How to improve effectiveness? What knowledge/expertise/data is missing? How to harvest the missing data? What policy is needed or not being implemented correctly? How does this compare to what happens in other contexts? What tools, incentives, and training are required for successful social change? What are best practices in this area? How do we support change makers to achieve the goals of progress, development, equity, and inclusion? How can social change be viewed as a distributed/interdependent process rather than a centralized/individualized effort?

### Ways of Knowing, Imagining, and Evaluating Legitimacy: Branches (Epistemological Layer)

Critiques articulated from this layer (of epistemology) agree with the methodology layer that we need to _do_ things differently, but add that we need to _think about_ things differently as well. Epistemological critiques identify how the politics of knowledge are deeply linked to the naturalization of ongoing historical and systemic inequalities. These inequalities include the uneven distribution of power, wealth, and labor; as well as the hierarchies of merit, credibility, and worth of cultures, individuals, and life itself. Epistemological critiques identify how our dominant frames of reference favor certain ways of knowing over others and thereby determine what is intelligible, desirable, and imaginable. Focusing on the branches of the olive tree, epistemological critiques explore different directions and angles of growth that could help the tree produce a broader range of better and more diverse outputs (e.g., grafting a branch from a tree that produces black olives onto a tree that produces green olives). Having identified more deeply rooted problems in the system, this approach tends to advocate for more drastic (radical-reform) changes to existing political, economic, and educational systems than do methodological critiques. That is, we need to reconsider _what_ and _how_ we know—and how we might know _differently._

These dominant frames, in turn, shape the kinds of questions we can ask and the answers that can be provided; the ways we adjudicate the authority of knowledge claims; and the perceived validity of approaches to change. When we recognize the limitations of these dominant frames, several imperatives become clear, including a need to attend to epistemological diversity and thus to disrupt the illusion of epistemic certainty (and the universality that certainty implies). Thus, critiques of dominant ways of knowing question the construction of what is perceived as natural, normal, and common sense. Such critiques examine how knowledge (rather than ignorance) can be used to rationalize socio-material practices that sacrifice the well-being of certain populations for the benefit of others. Epistemological critiques therefore help to identify the role of knowledge in historical and ongoing slavery, colonialism, imperialism, racism, capitalism, heteropatriarchy, ableism, and other forms of normativity—although all these dimensions are rarely identified at the same time. Thus, it is deemed necessary to change the content of existing conversations and institutions by rethinking who is considered an “expert,” and ensuring access for more historically marginalized populations, thereby addressing questions of representation as well as redistribution.

When addressing the role of education, this layer of critique will emphasize the limits of a single story of progress, development, and human evolution. Educational interventions in line with this approach will focus on the inclusion of perspectives that have been excluded (same questions, different answers). Regarding international development, critique at this layer questions the hegemony and presumed universality of Western-led development models—particularly how they ignore and invalidate local knowledges and the possibilities they offer for developing differently. Thus, these critiques promote alternative forms of development, for instance, democratizing participation in development so that local communities have greater power in decision-making. In terms of social change, historical and systemic analyses will be emphasized and the position of those with lived experience of social injustice will be prioritized in the definition of approaches, directions, and solutions.

Questions that might be asked at the epistemological layer include: Whose bodies and voices are represented in decision-making? Who decides which direction is “forward”? In whose name? For whose benefit? How come (i.e., historical/systemic forces)? How are dissenting voices included (or not)? Whose terms of dialogue or inclusion are in operation? What collective traumas are present? Why? Who has been historically and systemically wounded? Whose vulnerabilities are visible or invisible? What notions of authority, merit, credibility, normality, and entitlement are at work? What is being opposed and proposed as a replacement? How am I complicit in harm? How am I reading and being read? How can I enact ethical solidarity? What information needs to be known in order to enact contextually and culturally appropriate solutions? What experiences and sensibilities would allow us to access this information? How do desires for mastery and individual heroism limit approaches to social change? How are redistribution, redress, and reparation pursued?

### Ways of Being, Desiring, Hoping, Relating, and Existing in the World: Trunk and Roots (Ontological Layer)

The ontological layer is partly visible, through the trunk, and partly invisibilized, through the roots; but together they form the basis of the tree, from which the branches and leaves grow. Ontological critiques focus on the fact that solutions emerging from the same ways of knowing that modernity has authorized will not be able to address the problems modernity has created. For example, we cannot expect capitalism, the state, or Enlightenment humanism to fix the problems that capitalism, the state, and Enlightenment humanism have produced—we therefore need to learn to exist otherwise. In this view, in the short term, contemporary problems might be mitigated in important ways by minor or major adjustments to its existing institutions. However, in the long term, the problems will not be eradicated until the foundations of this system expire, and until we learn from the current system’s mistakes, mourn its decline, and assist with its passing with integrity, we won’t be able to create different possibilities in its place. Focusing on the trunk and roots enables us to pay attention to the wider life cycle of the plant, its relation to the larger ecological metabolism within which it is embedded, as well as its inevitable death. This perspective shares much of the major reform critiques, but goes beyond reconsidering what we do, and how and what we think, to also ask questions about who and what we are (beyond what or who we think we are), the conditions for us to be and to understand being that way, the nature of reality (time, space, conscience, and being), and how we could relate to the world and experience coexistence differently. This critique seeks to explore the boundaries of what we perceive to be real, intelligible, possible, and relevant and look for alternatives that are viable but unimaginable within modernity’s frames of reference and desirability.

When it comes to education, this layer of critique emphasizes the pedagogical need to expand our existing sensibilities, affective landscapes, and constellations of knowledge and relationality. Such an expansion might then prepare us with the stamina and strength to face the difficulties of unlearning our investments in a dying system, and of learning to travel alongside one another (rather than in front of or behind) in order to pluralize possibilities for coexistence on a fragile planet. With regard to international development, this critique questions the very idea of “progress,” and thus considers the need for not just alternative forms _of_ development, but alternatives _to_ development, as well as alternative forms of engagements with alternatives. This analysis addresses the limits of viewing modernity as a universal model for development, which has led us dangerously close to the limits of our planetary capacity. Thus, within this analysis, mainstream development is identified as a theory of change that no longer offers a compelling or ethical narrative vision for the future—if it ever did. Approaches to social change that undertake this analysis consider the possibility that the roots of the identified problems do not stem only or primarily from a lack of relevant, appropriate, or specific knowledge needed to fix these problems. Rather, the roots of these problems might be better articulated as a harmful habit of being where desires that shape the pursuit of predetermined solutions, mastery, and innocence constrain other ways of relating and other modes of existence. The critique shifts from an emphasis on how to understand problems in deeper and more nuanced ways, to a questioning of the desires for and limits of trying to fix the present for an imagined future on behalf of a supposedly universal humanity.

Because questions that might be asked at the ontological layer delve into the core of our being, these questions examine fundamental notions about our experience and understanding of reality, self, consciousness, time, space, change, life, and death. These questions include: How is the possibility of my understanding (knowing or sensing), or lack thereof, shaped and limited by my lived experience? What is this experience (of not knowing) teaching me about the likelihood of possibilities that I could not have imagined existed? How is my imagination restricted by modernity? What pedagogical frameworks might support a relationship to knowledge that is not limited to description (becoming aware of the problems) and then prescription (seeking out appropriate actions to solve it), and instead works toward holding and working with and through complexity and unpredictability? How might desires to “fix” and “solve” limit what global social change might be imagined as possible? What possibilities for global social change are enabled by a commitment not to “fixing” but to unraveling what structures our ways of being, and what possibilities lie beyond what we can know? How do we shift the action-oriented tendencies that currently dominate in education and social change discourses away from fixed horizons of certainty, and toward engaging with what is viable yet unimaginable?

The image of the olive tree evokes the structure of modernity as an ancient elder facing the prospect of death, who is teaching us about their mistakes and failures so that we can learn how to live and die differently. Although this insight has been with me for a long time, it only really landed for me in 2017, when I was in Puglia for an event on the subject of alternative spaces of education.[^8] I was sitting under one of the olive trees dying from the region’s bacterial infection. I wondered what that tree wanted to move within me, when I remembered a song by Leonard Cohen that my mentor, Lynn Mario de Souza, and I had associated with hospicing modernity a few years before. The lyrics of the song “Alexandra Leaving” can be interpreted as teaching about the beauty and integrity of grieving for something sacred that is going away or already gone. The song reminds us that we need to be prepared to say goodbye to modernity _leaving,_ in order to find the stamina and strength to remember that we have also existed before modernity appeared, and we may learn to exist differently as we say goodbye to modernity _lost._

## Exercise

This exercise[^9] invites you to meet modernity as a creature on your bus. This exercise is not about imagining modernity, but about inviting modernity to shape-shift into something unexpected and show itself to you. You may want to ask someone else to read aloud the instructions of the exercise for you. Remember that these are just guidelines to get you started; as you begin to engage with modernity, let it dance with you on its own terms and, if the two of you consent to it, you can rewrite the instructions of the exercise together.

**Instructions:** Close your eyes and settle your being in the physical body you inhabit. Listen to your breathing. Feel the subtle movements that nourish and cleanse all the cells in this body. Remember that death and birth are happening all the time in your metabolism. Remember that you depend on other beings inside your body—millions of them in your gut—to remain alive. Thank them for their labor. Tell them we are all trying to figure out how to integrate with the bio-intelligence guiding their work. Focus on your bus. Go to the deck where the whole of humanity—past, present, and future, as well as all nonhuman relations—is part of your bus. Welcome the beautiful, the ugly, the broken, and the messed up in everything and everyone. Set the intention to meet modernity face-to-face. See how the scenario changes as modernity shows itself to you.

- **Pay attention to the texture of modernity’s body:** Is it hard? Soft? Scaly? Hairy? Oily? Moist? Brittle? Slippery? Leathery? Is it cold? Hot? Warm? Icy?
- **Notice the smell of modernity:** Is it pungent? Acrid? Perfumed? Sulfuric? Moldy? Musky? Cheesy? Smoky? Rotten? Fishy? Let your mouth interact with modernity.
- **How does modernity taste?** Is the taste sweet? Sour? Salty? Bitter? Metallic? Woody? Does the taste remind you of blood? Strawberries? Vomit? Shit? Vinegar? Urine? Dirt?
- **Are there any sounds coming out of modernity?** Are these sounds loud? Sharp? Melodic? Rhythmic? Are the sounds patterned? Can you hear cracking? Whispering? Singing? Whistling? Inhaling? Exhaling? Can you hear a heartbeat?
- **What does modernity look like?** What are modernity’s colors? Are they light? Dark? Shadowy? Fuzzy? Solid? Glowing? Is modernity thin? Fat? Anemic? Feathery? Clean? Dirty? Smooth? Coarse?
- **What is modernity’s density like?** Is it heavy? Light? Solid? Airy? Hollow? Jelly-like? Steamy? Vaporous?
- **What is the temporality of modernity’s manifestation?** Is it present? Past? Future? Timeless? Is it an infant? A mature being? An elder? Does it live one lifetime? Many lifetimes? Has it arrived from the past? From the future? Does it have memory? Is it self-aware? Can you know its beginning? Can you know its end? Is it immortal? Where in time does it imagine itself to be?
- **Does modernity move?** If so, how? Does it fly? Crawl? Jump? Run? Dance? Pulse? Vibrate? Wiggle? Wink? Have sex? Poop? Gag? Shape-shift? Are the moves fast? Slow? Flowing? Jittery? Rushed? Can it track your movements?
- **How is modernity doing?** Is it engaged? Withdrawn? Indifferent? Embarrassed? Happy? Depressed? Nervous? Angry? Scared? Traumatized? Calm? Curious? Resentful? Jealous? Drunk? Stoned? Stuck? Regal? Flirting? Teasing? Laughing? Crying? Aloof? Guarded? Confused? Demanding? Fearful?
- **What is modernity whispering in your ear?**

Make an embodied note of the sense of modernity in this manifestation. For a week, notice how you see it around you and on your bus. Observe how much space it takes and what it is trying to teach you. After a week, create a ritual of release for this configuration of modernity and let modernity shape-shift again inside and around you. Humor it in a game of hide-and-seek. **Form an educational relationship with modernity so that it can keep teaching you and being taught by you in whatever shape it takes.**

The House of Modernity

We are used to thinking about maps as representations of geographical landscapes or other types of data. Like wording the world, maps are perceived to describe reality in ways that give us a better sense of predictability and control of our environment. However, in the approach of worlding the world, maps have a very different function. Their purpose is not to represent something already visible, but to do work in the world by surfacing what is unconscious, invisibilized, and naturalized, and moving things within and between us. In this sense, maps invite you into an aesthetic experiment where we can un-numb and activate other senses in order to experience reality in a different way—intellectually, affectively, and relationally.

The creative social maps used in this book are entity maps, like the entity stories. Their work is to clear the intellectual and affective clutter so that we can develop capacity to hold space for difficult things we may have been trying to avoid looking at. They invite us to take some distance from our opinions and desires in order to view them with healthy skepticism; and to ask where they come from, where they lead to, who decides, in whose name, for whose benefit, why, how things could be imagined differently, and what the limits of what we can imagine are. They also invite us to consider what could be gained (affectively and relationally) from holding on to certain ideas, hopes, aspirations, perceived entitlements, and forms of relationship; and what also could be blocked, invisibilized, lost, or missed out on in this process. These creative social maps are neither descriptive nor prescriptive. They are not trying to impart content or offer a point of arrival that we all should agree with.

Figure 3: The House of Modernity

The creative social map called the House of Modernity,[^1] in figure 3 below, first appeared as a synthesis of critiques of modernity conveyed through a single image of a house exceeding the limits of the planet. This image was inspired by Audre Lorde’s famous insight that “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change.”[^2] The original illustration of the house drew on analyses emerging from Indigenous, Black, and decolonial practices and studies, post-development and post-colonial theory, and (different strands of) psychoanalysis. This analysis was informed by the works of dozens of scholars.[^3]

The map was used and revised in collaboration with Indigenous communities in Latin America who added layers, questions, concerns, and practices to the _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira. The story of the house of modernity, told through the different frames of the creative social map, became an exceptionally useful tool to start conversations about the violence and unsustainability of our current system. Several versions of this map have emerged in different collaborations. The coexistence of multiple maps and stories illustrates a sensibility that does not try to impose a single story as a description of reality, but tries to play with dynamic entity-stories as a means to dig deeper and relate wider.

The Story of the House Modernity Built

This map tells the story of a large and expanding house, located on a planet only slightly bigger than itself. Because the house is rapidly expanding, it is about to exceed the limits of the planet. The foundations of the house are built on solid concrete that separates humans from the rest of nature. This foundation of separability is associated with human exceptionalism and anthropocentrism. Separability removes the intrinsic value of life that grounds relations of equanimity and an individual’s inherent sense of self-worth. Hence, if your life does not carry intrinsic value, you will need to produce value within the economies of modernity in order to justify your worth, and why you deserve to be alive. The foundation of the house creates degrees of hierarchical value that rank allegedly separate beings and cultures against one another according to their perceived utility within modernity’s economies. In particular, separations between humans and the earth and other-than-human beings are premised on conquest, domination, and property ownership. Separations between human beings and human cultures occur through the creation of hierarchies premised on race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, ability, neurotypicality, nationality, employment, and citizen status. These fantasies of separation, ownership, and hierarchy lay the groundwork for the rest of the house and are the main features of modernity’s ways of being.

The carrying walls of the house are represented on one side by universal reason and on the other side by the nation-state. The wall of universal reason is held together by Western humanist values and Enlightenment knowledge traditions, which are based on the wording of the world and promise consensus and universal relevance. This wall denies the relevance of non-Western knowledges, unless they can fit within its frame and show gratitude for being included in the wall of knowledge of universal worth. On the other side is the wall of nation-states, which promise security through borders, rights, and national homogeneity—all of which are ultimately maintained through processes of state-sanctioned violence at home and abroad. The current roof of this house is made of the clay tiles of global capitalism, layered over beams of continuous economic growth and consumption as a measure of progress and civilization. Thus, while the house modernity built offers shiny promises of endless consumption, comfort, safety, and social mobility, these promises are subsidized by a colonial underside: the externalized and invisibilized costs of building and maintaining the house.

Some people have suggested that the house better represents “white modernity,” acknowledging that many nonwhite people have sought to transform modernity from within. However, both white and multicultural modernity depend on the violence and unsustainability of the same structural tenets of modernity. In the same way that multicultural capitalism cannot undo the fundamental violence of capitalism, multicultural modernity cannot undo the violence of separability, logocentric universalism, the nation-state, or the dynamics of expropriation and accumulation that are required for social mobility and economic growth. Thus, although different cultures that are invested in the same social architecture may add non–load-bearing (decorative) walls and different façades to the house, the carrying structure tends to remain the same.

The second image of the house highlights these hidden costs. It draws attention to the externalized and invisibilized price of building and maintaining the house through historical and ongoing destitution; dispossession; and epistemicides, genocides, and ecocides. As this story is told, I must emphasize that these forms of violence manifest in contemporary times in many different forms including land occupation, blood mineral extraction, arms trade, denial of Indigenous peoples’ treaty rights, violent policing both at and within the borders of the house, poisoning of lands and waters through resource extraction, human trafficking, preventable famine and malnutrition, racialized incarceration, testing of new drugs and treatments on vulnerable populations, and interference in foreign elections.

In the image, one arrow points to the extraction of resources from the planet to the house, another shows the house dumping its sewage system and waste disposal on the planet. The arrows feed two patterns within the house: the pattern of overconsumption and the pattern of unsustainable growth. This frame underscores the facts that the house is built and maintained by expropriation and exploitation, and that the expansion of the house through exponential growth also requires the expansion of its violence.

The third image, of the house’s floors, complexifies the divisions within the house and problematizes desires related to the promise of social mobility and middle class for all. This image plays with the terms _global north_ and _global south._ Generally, people think that these terms relate to the geographical north and south, but the terms are mostly used to refer to richer and poorer countries. However, if we complexify it further, there are poor people in rich countries (the south of the north) and rich people in poor countries (the north of the south). There are also the richest people in the richest countries (the north of the north) and the poorest people in the poorest countries (the south of the south). In the image of the house, these terms are used not to refer to countries, but to how different groups benefit from and move within the house of modernity.

The top level of the house (the penthouse) is presented as the north of the north: those who have accumulated the most wealth and power in the house and have secured and stabilized their position as legitimate owners and heirs of the house. In the second level, the north of the south, are those invested in climbing the stairs of social mobility in an effort to reach the promised status and social and financial security of the north of the north. The basement is the place of the south of the north where those who have been exploited and marginalized within the house and who disidentify with the aspirations of the second and top floors build their economies and communities. Outside the house is the south of the south, those who live without the securities the house affords, subsidized its construction, pay the highest price for its maintenance, fight to protect alternatives to life inside the house, or who may seek entry into the house in a context where alternative ancestral or traditional livelihoods have been made impossible by the house itself.

This frame recalls the distinction between high-intensity and low-intensity forms of struggle presented before.[^4] Those involved in high-intensity struggle (also high-stakes and high-risk) in the south of the south and, occasionally, in the south of the north have been historically and systemically at the receiving end of the house’s violence and have fought for alternative ways of surviving in the basement or outside the house. Those engaged in low-intensity struggle have historically fought for inclusion and opportunities around the ladder of social mobility within the house and have the security to critique the house’s structure from within (myself included). Even when solidarity with high-intensity struggles put at risk some of the comforts and securities of those in low-intensity struggle, people in low-intensity struggle can still count on a safety net of resources, protections, and support (provided by families and social networks) unavailable to those in high-intensity struggle. Low-intensity struggles are marked by the availability of choice to engage or disengage according to one’s stated commitments or contextual conveniences.

The fourth image shows the house cracking below a water-damaged roof collapsing under the weight of social, ecological, economic, political, informational, and existential crises. This includes global pandemics, climate crisis, unsustainable growth, overconsumption, a surplus labor force, mass migration, economic precarity and instability, political polarization, social fragmentation, mental health crises, violent conflict, democratic election of populist governments, and the cancellation of welfare and rights. The frame invites the questions: Should we fix the house? Expand it? Build another house? Learn to live without a house? Create other types of shelter?

Those who live inside the house are deeply conditioned by its structure—intellectually, affectively, and relationally. For example, the house creates affective and relational feedback loops that are mostly unconscious, as seen in figure 4 (page 111). Certain fears (e.g., of scarcity, uncertainty, worthlessness, shame) are harnessed and recast as compensatory desires (e.g., for accumulation, certainty, superiority, purity), which in turn become perceived entitlements inside the house (e.g., to property, stability, immunity, innocence). These feedback loops of fears, desires, and perceived entitlements keep people deeply attached to and dependent on the house. It is also likely that the house of modernity imprints distinct default pathways within our neurobiology. These modern/colonial imprints condition us to respond in predefined ways to stimuli that are authorized within and that reinforce modernity’s economies, driving our behavior toward dependence on further existential investments in modernity. Breaking these affective, relational, and neurofunctional feedback loops is as difficult as interrupting addictions. There will be more on this topic in the last section of this chapter.

## Exercise

Pause. Notice the shape, colors, texture, density, and materials of physical structures around you that were made by other human beings, including the structures that make it possible for you to read this book (e.g., paper, computer, seat, floor, roof). How are these entities related to the house of modernity? What shape, colors, density, and materials might be around if you were not within the house of modernity? Who pays the true costs for the production and disposal of these structures? How does the house protect you and also shield you from the consequences of these comforts for other people and the planet? Check your bus. Try to identify passengers deeply attached to the different structural tenets of the house (Enlightenment humanism, modern nation-states, capitalism, separability, social mobility). Try to identify passengers who may aspire to live in different parts of the house (penthouse, stairs, basement, outside). What do you think will happen to the passengers invested in the house once they notice the house is cracking and likely collapsing? Will they want to reform the house? To replace the house? To hospice the house, as they learn to build other temporary forms of shelter? What affective and relational feedback loops might be at work in their responses?

The Promises of the House

Each structural tenet of the House of Modernity issues a promise based on violence and unsustainability, that also naturalizes and normalizes colonial expectations for the inhabitants of the house.[^5] The foundation of separability issues the promise of _unrestricted autonomy_ (for certain people)—which makes responsibility optional, dependent on individual choice—and protects people from seeing the costs and consequences of their choices. The promise of autonomy is premised on racialized hierarchies of existence and on the negation of responsibilities to one another and the metabolism of the planet we are part of. This promise creates expectations of unlimited freedom to extract value and exploit what is considered a “resource”—including other humans. The wall of universal reason promises _seamless progress_ achieved through certainty, mastery, and predictability expressed primarily in science and technology. The promise of seamless progress rests on the delegitimation and elimination of other knowledge systems; and on the mobilization of sanctioned knowledge to rationalize violence, superiority, and control. This promise creates expectations that certain people will have the absolute authority to impose meaning, arbitrate justice, and distribute resources according to modernity’s authorized criteria of legitimacy, status, merit, and fairness.

The wall of the nation-state issues promises of _security_ and _order_ through the protection of property and the policing of borders, as well as social cohesion through strategically created national identities. These promises rest on state-sanctioned violence and, in many cases, occupation of Indigenous lands. These promises create expectations for unlimited social security and the right to define exclusionary communities. The roof of global capitalism issues a promise of _happiness_ and _comfort_ through wealth accumulation. This promise is predicated on unending economic growth and the racialized expropriation and exploitation of humans and other-than-human beings. This promise creates expectations for unlimited enjoyments and infinite consumption. Finally, the stairs of social mobility issue a promise of meritocratic _affluence._ This promise is predicated on ascribing differential and conditional worth to the lives and work of humans and other-than-human beings according to the given rules of the system.

People inside the house who have only known the house and its promises tend not to question its viability and futurity. Thus, the politics within the house focuses mostly on internal redecorations rather than structural changes. As people start to intuitively realize that the promises are becoming unviable and are not going to be kept, their responses will vary. If these promises are perceived to be broken, many people will defend their perceived right to have these promises secured by voting for strong populist leaders (left or right) who claim they can fix the problems and protect the futurity of the house. If these promises are perceived to be unrealistic, many people will initially search for replacements mirroring the same expectations that the promises created. They will look for already articulated alternatives that can mimic the securities they desire—perhaps in the form of a different architecture that reorganizes the elements of the house, with perhaps different materials but upon the same foundations of separability.

As our attempts to salvage modernity by fixing or replacing it fail, there is a possibility that we will become disenchanted and disillusioned with modernity’s promises in a generative way. This is the point where colonial desires can be reoriented uncoercively toward something outside our realm of intelligibility, and hence deemed impossible within modernity’s walls. As we start to disidentify with the promises of modernity and to disinvest from modernity’s structures of being (not just of knowing), we may find the time and the vitality to be taught by modernity dying, and assist in the death process with attention, discernment, and integrity.

## Exercise

Pause again. Find a way to connect with the sky (if you can’t do it physically, just imagine it). Remind everyone on your bus that you are in this little bluish dervish dancing planet, whirling at 460 meters per second (roughly 1000 miles per hour), pirouetting around the sun at the speed of 30 kilometers per second (67,000 miles per hour) and rotating with the rest of the solar system around the center of the galaxy at 220 kilometers per second (490,000 miles per hour). Everything is moving and we don’t really know why this dance is happening, when it started, or when it is going to end. We do know that our little spinning planet was born some 4.45 billion years ago and is predicted to die in about 7.5 billion years because the sun is expanding and will probably engulf it. Taking this into account, how would you like to spend the rest of your time in your physical body—which is part of this planet?

Check your bus. Try to identify passengers deeply attached to the different promises of the house of modernity. Why are these promises so important to them? What are they afraid of? What do they feel entitled to? How will your passengers respond when they realize that the promises are broken or were unrealistic from the outset?

Collective Cultural Dis-ease

Within the house of modernity, human development is associated with a singular pathway forward toward progress and civilization, and since modernity sees itself as the apex of civilization, it places modern subjectivities (modern humans) as the apex of human social evolution. This affects everything: psychology, neurobiology, medicine, science, education.… These disciplines and related institutions assume that those who are functional and well adapted to producing value in modernity’s economies are “normal,” well-adjusted, and in a position to judge and to “help” those who are not, to “catch up” with modernity’s program.

Education, psychology, and more recently, neuroscience have been tasked with creating the conditions for people to improve health and well-being within the house of modernity. Research funding prioritizes projects that affirm modernity’s hierarchical standards for aesthetic, moral, political, and social norms as a universal yardstick. Funding for studying the effects of opera and Shakespeare on the brain are available, whereas funding for the study of the “modern/colonial brain” and the effects of the denial of violence and unsustainability is not. It would be great to see the use of the latest and most expensive brain imaging and sensory technology to explore questions like: What kinds of high arousal occur when we feel superior to and more deserving than others? How are we conditioned to enjoy the benefits of colonialism and deny its ongoing violence? What kinds of neuropathways are created by the material, intellectual, affective, and relational economies of modernity? What other neurochemical and neurofunctional configurations would be possible if we were not bound by those economies? Unfortunately, these types of research are both unthinkable and unfundable in modern science.

It would also be interesting if we researched our attachments and investments within modernity as forms of dependence and addiction imposed by modernity itself. One definition of addiction frames it as a physical desire to consume something beyond our capacity to control it and in defiance of all rules of common sense.[^6] Addiction also highlights the interdependence of neurobiological feedback loops—for example, how we may be intellectually committed to heal a traumatic experience, but stop ourselves from healing because we are not ready to let go of the coping mechanisms we have developed to handle or compensate for the trauma. However, it is important to be careful when we talk about addictions in this way because it may contribute to the stigmatization of addiction as a moral failure. At the same time addiction can also be extremely useful as an analogy pointing to the physical compulsion toward, and mental obsessions with, unaccountable consumption, unrestricted individual autonomy, exceptionalism, and pleasure within modernity.

Research into the neurobiology of modernity/coloniality could take many forms. What I will present next is a tentative and oversimplified metaphorical speculation. I am not claiming any expertise as a clinician-researcher in neurophysiology or neuroendocrine modulation. However, I believe this exploratory framework of the neurobiology of modernity is a useful stimulus for an inquiry on modernity’s imprints in our neurophysiology and the implications for pedagogical invitations that seek to interrupt our existential investments in the house of modernity.

### Separability as Imprinted Neurochemical and Neurofunctional Pathways

My starting point is the foundation of separability of the house of modernity. Separability creates a _sense_ of separation between humans and nature, which is also the basis of hierarchies of worth between and within human cultures. A sense of separation does not only happen in the cognitive domain, it also involves affective and relational domains both conscious and unconscious. However, we tend to think of these domains as abstract and conceptual, rather than grounded on neurochemical metabolic processes. But what if the sense of separation imposed by modernity is both the result of and a reinforcement mechanism for distinct neurochemical and neurofunctional pathways in our bodies?

Neuroscientists who study psychotropic plants used in ceremonies by Indigenous communities see serotonin as one of the main neuroendocrine modulators that gives us the sense of connection and entanglement with everything else. That is, a sense of connection occurs when something activates the release and reuptake of serotonin in our bodies. Pedagogically and metaphorically, I will use serotonin as a proxy for the sense of metabolic entanglement that is repeatedly and deliberately severed by modernity. Thus, I propose the hypothesis that by imposing separability (by design, although not always in explicit ways); at a basic level modernity reorients the production, release, and absorption of serotonin (as part of a much more complex set of neurofunctional processes). This reorientation causes us to feel separated from the larger metabolism, and it removes our sense of the intrinsic value of our lives and the lives of others.

Because of this reorientation, we feel compelled to seek connection and the external validation for our sense of worth through participation in modern affective, intellectual, relational, and material economies. If we fail to participate in these economies, our serotonin pathways are not activated and we feel isolated and worthless, which makes us feel insecure, alone, and unable to relate to others. Because of this state of permanent separability, individuation, and (perceived) disconnection, the quality of well-being afforded for example in Indigenous communities through continuous collective ceremonial practices is exiled from the house of modernity because people within cannot believe or imagine it is possible to feel well in a different way.

Modern economies offer packages of happiness and well-being that are very ephemeral: that can make us happy and satisfied for some time, and that keep us coming back for more. Modernity convinces us that we can fill the (insatiable) existential gap created by separability through the consumption of goods, knowledge, relationships, critique, experiences, praise, and other forms of capital. In observing my field of study (education and social change), I have tentatively tried to map how these packages could be conditioning our neurochemistry. This hypothetical map draws attention to the embodied, organic, and metabolic nature of the mode of relating to (and consuming) the world within modernity.

Again, pedagogically, speculatively, and metaphorically, I propose that the most basic chemical cocktail that modernity offers as a way of filling the gap left by the restrictions in the production, release, and absorption of serotonin (used as a proxy for more complex processes) consists of dopamine, oxytocin, endorphins, and adrenaline. This hypothesis suggests that modernity’s material, intellectual, affective, and relational economies create a neurofeedback loop where we become metabolically dependent on this cocktail for feeling good temporarily (the effects only last for a while). I offer a brief synthesis of what each of these neurochemical substances could be offering us in terms of types, textures, and intensities of pleasure.

### Feeling Good within Modernity

Dopamine is the chemical considered to give us a sense of reward. In itself, this is not a problem; we need dopamine to survive. The problem is the source and meaning (e.g., mastery, domination, superiority) associated with this sense of reward and how this is used within modernity. For example, we get dopamine hits when we complete a task (like finishing a report or reaching a mountain peak), and we also get a hit when we win a competition or achieve a milestone that improves our social status. Dopamine hits are triggered when we receive “likes” that confirm our sense of authority or that increase the popularity of our social media profiles. We also get dopamine hits when we buy items that will make us look prettier, younger, slimmer, or “whiter” (or an alternative parameter of superior status) in comparative economies of worth. Dopamine may also be involved when we find pleasure in seeing other people’s failures, fiascos, or disasters, as it gives us a sense of superiority. In the same way that colonial “pioneers” were driven by dopamine in their mission to occupy Indigenous lands, we could also be driven to compete, and consume for power and status within the hierarchies of modernity by a physical urge for dopamine. If dopamine is mobilized for social change, the message is one of conquest, occupation, or defeating your opponent. It can be argued that, at large, the motivation to produce knowledge and engage in politics within modernity is also driven by dopamine. This may be so because forms of politics and knowledge production based on dopamine are intelligible and relatable, while politics and knowledge production based on serotonin, for example, could be mostly unintelligible in modern societies.

Oxytocin is a necessary chemical that establishes an essential bond of protection between mothers and babies in mammals and that makes us focus on exclusive relationships. However, within modernity, our sourcing of oxytocin could be keeping us in an infantile state where our relational bonds are dependent on mutual coddling. In this sense, we seek transactional and projective relationships that can immediately address our perceived affective entitlements. If the person fails to respond to our need for connection in the ways we imagine or project, we tend to reject the person wholesale. The overarching motto of such transactional relationships is “my way or the highway.” If our relationships are driven by an urge for oxytocin, we will not be equipped for relationships where we grow up and grow old together; facing the whole package of complexities, contradictions, grief, and uncertainties of life, and learning and changing as we go. Oxytocin is also produced in our bodies when we watch cute videos (kittens, puppies, or babies) on social media. If oxytocin is mobilized for social change, the message is one of paternalistic charity. For instance, think about the _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira of starving children presented in charity ads. Within modernity, humanitarian efforts and efforts at poverty relief rely on messages and _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira aimed at triggering a parental response toward a child in need, and this may be the only thing that leads to successful fundraising in these circumstances.

Endorphins are chemicals similar to opioids, produced in the body to relieve stress and pain. Endorphins are the neurochemicals we seek when we want to numb ourselves to physical or emotional pain, both individual and collective. Chocolate, pizza, meat, nuts, and grapes are foods that cause the production and release of endorphins in the brain and that generate pleasant feelings. In communities that have historically and systemically faced discrimination and marginalization, I have observed that making hidden violent processes visible (when we successfully articulate the workings of colonialism, racism, sexism, etc.) produces a relief effect that could be associated with endorphins. Since systemic violence and pain are by default invisibilized, making them visible has an anesthetic effect on the bodies that suffer these forms of violence because there is also a deceptive anticipation that the visibilization of harm will prevent further harm. When this anticipation is not met, people are left in a difficult situation where they may become dependent on sourcing the relief that endorphins provide from articulating critique and calling others out. Since pain relief is not pain release, the need for relief is unappeasable until pain is released. In this sense, people may get caught in calling out racism in society because they need the endorphins that this calling out provides. The problem is that, by doing this, they increase the threshold for the effectiveness of endorphins. Like opioids, the more you use endorphins, the more endorphins you need to provide the same effect. This could lead to a situation where calling out racism is no longer enough to give someone a sense of relief, which then would require upping the game. If critique or moral economies start to be largely driven by a dependence on endorphins, the social fabric that modernity relies upon is irreversibly torn.

The last chemical in my speculative cocktail is adrenaline. Adrenaline is a neurochemical normally associated with responses related to fear, panic, and threat, but it can also be intentionally triggered as a source of heightened energy, excitement, strength, and alertness. Bungee jumping and skydiving are examples of activities that use adrenaline as a way to awaken the senses and to give people a jolt of useful stimulation. This intentional triggering of adrenaline (as a way of “feeling alive”) is also at work in social and cultural transgression and deliberate high-risk behavior. My intuition is that when adrenaline is mobilized in social change it is associated with different forms and orientations of disobedience, moving people on different sides of an issue to seek confrontation to interrupt existential boredom and social numbing. Adrenaline works as modernity’s pressure valve, which allows some stress to be relieved from the pressure cooker so that business can go on as usual.

If, at a fundamental level, we have become addicted to the neurochemical cocktails authorized by modernity’s economies, we are collectively experiencing a cultural dis-ease. Symptoms manifest as an obsessive compulsion to consume feelings of pleasure, reward, conditional belonging, temporary relief from pain and stress, or transgression, which, in turn, become the basis of a physiological dependence on these cocktails. This dependency is detrimental to relationships at every level: intrapersonal (insatiable consumption, anxiety, depression), interpersonal (transactional relationships, arrogance, echo chambers), systemic (hierarchies of worth, colonialism, imperialism), and ecological (commodification, exploitation, and destruction of ecosystems). Further, dependence on this cocktail leads us (collectively) to self-destructive behavior (e.g., climate crises, widespread violence and genocide, accelerating extinction rates, and loss of biodiversity). Perhaps it would be useful to frame this collective addictive behavior as a form of cultural disorder. Often, the first step is to admit we have a problem.

I am aware these are extremely limited speculations pointing to more complex biophysical processes related to our neurophysiology. Like the house of modernity creative cartography, the cocktail metaphor has a pedagogical function. It invites us to think about our current predicament not only in abstract, intellectual ways that can be addressed with “right” thinking or policies, but in physiological and metabolic terms that require a much more complex approach taking account of intellectual, embodied, and social/systemic landscapes.[^7]

## Exercise

Pause. Check your bus. Find passengers at the front of the bus who are “addicted” to each of the chemicals described in this section: dopamine (superiority), oxytocin (transactional relations), endorphin (numbing/pain relief), adrenaline (transgression). How does this addiction manifest in your passengers’ behavior? How is this addiction pleasurable? Where do these passengers normally source their highs? How are their addictions creating harm for yourself, the people around you, and the system at large? For what traumas and insecurities could this behavior be a compensation or coping mechanism? What kind of “rock bottom” would be necessary to convince all of our passengers that these addictions are both harmful and unsustainable? What could rehab for a whole culture look like, and how difficult do you think it would be?

Modernity conditions us to believe that in order to change reality or our ways of being, we first need to imagine what this change looks like, and then make a plan and act to achieve that goal. That is why many people ask me the question: if not modernity, then what? I usually say that this is a logical question—within modernity’s logic. I warn people who start with that question that they will not like my answer, which is: we will only be able to imagine something _genuinely_ different if we first become suspicious of what we desire and are able to imagine within modernity. This is the first step toward hospicing modernity. In many ways, the only way out of the intellectual, affective, relational, and creative limits imposed by modernity is to intentionally pay more attention to modernity’s death rather than try to fix, replace, or escape it. This is not easy. Modernity has already restricted the parameters of what we can think, relate, imagine, and desire; and our intellect alone cannot interrupt this in time: modernity is faster than thought. This is why we cannot simply think our way out of modernity. Whatever we imagine when we are still invested in modernity will always only be a different version of modernity that secures the entitlements and enjoyments modernity affords us now. Because these entitlements and enjoyments are based on violence and unsustainability, we are back to a circular pattern of systemic harm.

In order to create the possibility for us to imagine something genuinely different, we first need to notice the harms we are causing, and become dissatisfied with the things we enjoy that cause those harms (e.g., comfort, security, certainty). Only then might we begin to loosen the relational and affective restrictions modernity has imposed upon our being; and learn to see, sense, and relate otherwise. However, it is extremely difficult to interrupt the satisfactions we have with modernity’s rewards, and it certainly does not happen overnight. Identifying one’s harmful desires, which can happen through exercises of deep self-reflection or through witnessing the harm one is causing firsthand, is only the first step on the road. Interrupting our (unconscious) enjoyment of these harmful desires is another journey altogether, and it is fraught with relapses, sidesteps, and dead ends. It requires long, sustained practice. In the GTDF collective we say that this is not a sprint, but a marathon requiring discipline and training. It is also very easy to think that you are already doing it, when in fact you are still trapped in the illusions and denials of modernity.

For example, observe your response to the idea that modernity is within all of us, but spread unevenly. If your thought after reading this sentence was something like, “Because I am an artist, activist, have been engaged with alternatives, or have a spiritual practice, I have already let go of modernity,” I would invite you to think again, because such responses can be very indicative of modernity trying to hide. Those who have deeply wrestled with the modernity within themselves do not usually underestimate it. These few people would be very skeptical of their own responses, and they would be also asking questions like, “How is modernity hiding in my unconscious right now? How is it conditioning how I feel, relate, and respond to the world in ways that I am not aware of? How is it at work in my initial response to the first sentence?” They would not be looking for an excuse or an easy way out; instead they would try to be present to the fantasies and difficult teachings of modernity hiding in their answers.

This chapter is about how modernity is internalized through our socializations in modern institutions, and how it becomes faster than thought. The stories in this chapter invite you to take a look at how modernity may have restricted your field of experience, especially through formal education.

Who Knows Better?

When my daughter was six years old, we moved from England, where we had been for the past four years, to Aotearoa/New Zealand. As soon as we arrived in the country, I went to register her at the local school. The person responsible for the registration looked at my daughter’s Brazilian passport and told me she would have to be first placed in a separate class to learn English. I told them that my daughter had gone to preschool in England, that she could read and write in English, and that this class was not necessary. I also explained that in fact, she already spoke English better than she spoke Portuguese. The person felt offended by my response, and told me that it was school policy to place immigrants in the special class first. I decided not to pick a battle on that day. I had fought many similar battles before, and this incident clearly told me that soon there would be more to come.

I picked my daughter up after her first day of school and asked how it went. She said she had had a great day, but that there was something bothering her. I asked her to tell me what she felt she should tell me. She said that, first of all, she thought that the school was great, because—unlike in her English school—they only played that entire day. She explained that not much work could be done because only the teacher and she could speak and read in English. She then mentioned that the teacher had told all the students that now that they were in Aotearoa/New Zealand, they would all become “kiwis.” This is what was bothering my daughter. I laughed because I thought that she had misunderstood what _kiwi_ meant in that context; however, that was not the case. She then explained very seriously to me that a kiwi is someone whose identity is tied to New Zealand. She then asked (and I quote her directly): “Are they trying to arrest my mind?” I was not prepared for that question and asked for clarification. She said that she was not comfortable with the teachers trying to define her identity for her. I remind you: she was six years old.

That same year, I was leading a project on a methodology for philosophical inquiry in schools in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Part of my job was to pilot stories that could be used as a starting point for these inquiries with students from preschool to university. As I piloted the methodology, I was interested in noticing patterns of interpretation of stories across age groups and levels of formal education. In this role, I found striking differences in these patterns, which I highlighted in my notes as telling examples. The stories of these examples would dance with me for years to come. Next, I will share a couple of them. However, I should note that these stories are anecdotal and circumstantial, rather than objective or universal. It is also not my intention to idealize or romanticize any group of children (or adults, for that matter).

I was once testing a story for the first time with different groups in a school in Otautahi/Christchurch. I started piloting the story and methodology with a group of four- and five-year-olds. The warm-up question for this inquiry was, “Where do you think your thoughts come from?” Their responses were both profound and hilarious. One child started by saying that his thoughts came from his belly, especially at lunchtime. Another said that thoughts are a mixture of dreams we have when we sleep and conversations we have with ourselves when we are awake. For another child, many thoughts came from TV cartoons, some from her dog, but she also suspected her mum had something to do with it. One child said thoughts could come from many different places, including things we are afraid of. Another one said that it depended on the time of the day and what was happening inside your heart. At that point, one child asked the others: how many thoughts do we have every day? The first response was that we had just one long, winding, slimy but hairy thought—like a cross between a slug, a snake, and a caterpillar. Another response was that thoughts were like the rain and created mud puddles for us to splash in. This was followed by a comment that the best thoughts felt like playing outside in the sun in the spring, right after that rain.

The next exercise in this philosophical inquiry was for us to hear a story and observe the many thoughts that came in response to it. This story was about two monsters who were siblings, one green and one yellow. The green monster was obsessed with the form of things: with measuring and documenting everything. The yellow monster was obsessed with the shape-shifting movement of things: with feeling and processing everything deeply. They had an argument about who they thought knew more and better. They decided to make a bet: they would go away for a year, come back with something to show for it, and then ask a panel of judges to decide who won the bet. The green monster knew exactly what to do: it would find a spot, fence it, measure and label everything from the small grain of sand to the tallest tree, and document all this in the most accurate book. The yellow monster knew exactly what to do: it would travel as much as possible, experience things as deeply as possible, then sit in a quiet place with everything brewing inside, and come back with a captivating song. A year passed and the two monsters met again to decide who knew more and better. One had an accurate book, the other had a captivating song.[^1]

At this point, the story was paused and children were invited to act as a panel of judges. They were told that, before any judgment, we had to develop and exercise discernment: we needed to have a conversation about the perceptions and thoughts that guided our decisions—where they came from, where they seemed to be going, and what important thoughts could be absent from the conversation. The children were then invited to formulate questions that could help us think together in this way. They came up with: What is knowledge? How do we know? What is the knowledge of the book and of the song? Is more knowledge better knowledge? Were the monsters hungry? What were they hungry for? What were they afraid of? Did they miss each other when they were away for a year? Please note that these questions, coming from five-year-old children, illustrate wonder, plurality, and signs of both rational and relational rigor.

It is also important to note that the point of the inquiry was not the adjudication of the knowledge contest in the story per se. The story was being used not as a point of arrival, but as an invitation for movement. The children were being initiated into a practice of inquiry where they did not focus on the form of the story, but on its motion. This practice is about touching the known, the unknown, the unknowable. It is about our ability to dance with stories, rather than holding them down with chains of fixed interpretation.[^2]

Children who knew how to read and write approached the adjudication of knowledge very differently. When this story was used in a school with seven- and eight-year-olds, the questions and conversations that emerged were much more predictable. They already knew that the written world represented accumulated knowledge, that accumulated knowledge represented power, and that their role was to seek that power. They were also much more geared toward establishing consensus around the right answer and already had tactics to shut down dissent.

For the vast majority of these children, it was crystal clear that the green monster had more and better knowledge. Even the judgment in the story was perceived as ridiculous: we could not possibly compare the value of the knowledge of a whole accurate book with a “silly” song. The yellow monster obviously knew nothing—or at least nothing of value. A nonwhite child who had recently emigrated from Nepal dared to ask if only those who can read books had knowledge. The response from the rest of the group was a categorical “yes”! He asked again: “Do you think four-year-olds know nothing because they cannot read and write?” “Yes.” “Do you think a grandfather who is eighty-three knows nothing because he cannot read and write?” “Yes.” This is an example of how modernity works in formal schooling and what it can do. Without any of us noticing it, it robs us of relational rigor.[^3]

It is interesting that children who had not yet learned how to read and write were much more open to the practice of dancing with stories than those who had acquired alphabetic literacy. Alphabetic literacy is perceived to open up children’s worlds to the written world, but we seldom consider what other worlds it may close. The practices of alphabetic literacy currently taught in schools are about stories that are fixed, and that attempt to fix things in place and in perfect form. Such ways of relating to stories comes from modernity, and we do not pay much attention to what these stories do to the children and to the world at large.

A month later, I returned to the school to pilot a different story from a picture book with the same two groups of children. This story was about an owl who falls into the chimney of a house during a storm and gets trapped inside. A girl finds the owl and offers it the choice of living in captivity or returning to the wilderness: living in the house and being taken care of by the girl, or living in the forest and having to take care of itself. The children were again invited to reflect on the types of judgment and discernment involved in that choice from the perspective of the owl and from their own perspective.

The difference between the questions that emerged for the children who knew how to read and write and for those who didn’t were, again, significant. The four-to-five-year-olds tended to assume the owl was leaning toward staying in the forest. Their questions, which were very imaginative, included: Why can’t _we_ live in the forest? Is the owl already missing the smell of the rain? Will the moon help rescue the owl from the house? Why can’t the girl see that the owl _belongs_ _to_ the trees? The seven-to-eight-year-olds tended to assume that the owl would choose to stay in the house. Their questions, which were more literal, included: What are the names of the owl and the girl? Would the owl ever be safe in the forest? What will the girl feed the owl? How big does the cage need to be for the owl to be able to play inside? Did the girl ask her parents to keep the owl? Would the owl and the girl’s cat get along? I also noticed that the children were looking at the teacher a lot during the session and that the teacher seemed very pleased with what was going on. The teacher told me later that they had had a session on safety the week before and that she could see that unit coming through in the ways the children in this group related to the story of the owl.

Toward the end of that session the child with the Nepalese background, who had asked about the grandfather the last time, raised his hand. He noticed something interesting in the picture book. His question was: Would the story be different had the house and the family been different? I asked him to clarify: Different in what sense? He shrugged, looked down, and signaled with his hand that he did not want to talk about this further. I wondered if he did not want to talk about this in front of the other children, so I approached him later, individually. He told me there were many things that could be different in the story. For example: the girl could be a boy, the house could look different, the girl might not be white, she could instead look like me or him. We then started a conversation about that. We talked about how picture books tended to show just one group of people. I told him that there were people trying to change that, but that it would take some time. He then dropped a question that I did not expect to hear that day: You know, they tell us that we can be anything we want, but everywhere you look, here at the school, at the stores, everywhere.… Why is everyone in charge white?

When I heard that, I was taken back to my first day in the country, when I registered my daughter at that school. The person who registered my daughter was not white, but had the sensibility of someone who belonged or sought belonging to the dominant culture. When I tried to assert my equality in that relationship, I was probably perceived to be challenging this person’s earned authority and right to arbitration, and that is probably why the person felt offended by me saying that my daughter already spoke English fluently. I wondered what would happen to this boy: how long he would be able to hold on to his divergent way of thinking—how long until group pressure would force him to imagine only what was socially authorized? Would he desire to belong in mainstream society and acquire its sensibilities, or would he rebel?

## Exercise

Check your bus. What conversations are happening right now? Are there any passengers trying to resist or to defend certain interpretations of the stories? Observe their strategies. Connect with the passengers that channel the kind of child you were at school. Think about the ways you negotiated social norms and power relations. How much did you challenge the authority of the teachers? How much did you challenge the authority of the norms that society imposed on you? How has this changed over the years? What were you told “growing up” meant? How has your formal education both expanded and limited your worldview? How would you answer the question of the child from Nepal in a way that would honor his divergence?

The following are questions I heard from children over the years, that challenged me to think more deeply about my answers. How would you respond to each of them?

- From a child in a refugee family who has recently arrived in Canada: Why is it that some people have so much and others have so little?
- From an Indigenous child: My grandma says that the salmon are the spirit of our ancestors. Is it true?
- From a child from a high socioeconomic background: If people keep cutting down forests and polluting the water, we will not be able to survive. Why are the adults still doing that?
- Has the background of the child influenced your responses? Why or why not?

Facing Humanity

Another foundational way that modernity is internalized is through our understanding of ourselves as human. In previous chapters we touched upon how modernity’s foundation of separability (the separation between humans and nature) is the basis of human exceptionalism, anthropocentrism, and foundational (systemic) narcissism. We also looked at how this creates hierarchies of worth between living entities and cultures according to their attributed value—in relation to their perceived contribution toward modernity’s economies and notions of progress, development, social evolution, and civilization. One important building block of hierarchies between human beings comes from a particular understanding of humanity.

Sharon Todd, an educational philosopher, argues that in the modern understanding of humanity we make a distinction between _human_ and _inhuman._ This distinction is at work when we talk about a “dehumanizing” act, about someone “losing humanity,” or about the need to “humanize” education, for example. When we make this distinction, we romanticize and idealize humanity by associating being human with virtue, beauty, goodness, greatness, benevolence, and innocence while associating being inhuman with evil—or with whatever does not fit modernity’s picture-perfect frame of humanity. There are numerous implications of this rather simple internalized distinction. Todd focuses on how this distinction is mobilized when there is a call for education to “cultivate humanity,” which is a call to reproduce the romanticized idealization of humanity, grounded on the human versus inhuman division. She proposes that, rather than cultivating humanity, education should challenge this dichotomy and support people to “face humanity” in its full spectrum: the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, the broken, and the messed up.

Another implication for education is that we use the romantic notion of being human to rationalize focusing on beauty and innocence as a way to escape examining human wrongs and our complicity in systemic, historical, and ongoing harm and unsustainability. We tend to see the role of education, for example, in association with self-expression and self-realization, which are defined within parameters of merit related to self-regulation within modernity, or one’s capacity to be “functional” by producing value within modernity’s economies. However, never, or very rarely, is education associated with facing humanity’s arrogance, cruelty, greed, stubbornness, or inefficiency in learning from its mistakes. The distinction between human and inhuman (good and evil) makes us disidentify with aspects of modernity that do not fit the picture-perfect frame we have internalized, and blame others who are considered inhuman when bad things happen. This supports the rationalization of why these others do not deserve to enjoy what we feel entitled to, and, at its extreme, to justify why they should be eliminated.

Having a critique of these patterns does not mean we can simply change this system of attributing worth in society—or even in ourselves: these patterns work in both the conscious and unconscious realms, and not only in the cognitive domain, but also in the affective and relational domains. Thus, you may try to self-consciously push for a cognitive reconfiguration within yourself (i.e., you can adopt a critical stance and fight actively against such violence, and you may even feel you have some success; but when you are off guard, or when you are pushed to your limits in a crisis, old patterns will generally reemerge from the affective and relational domains, revealing that there is always more work to be done).

For example, racism is a social system of value that attributes a higher worth to white bodies, and to sense-making and sensibilities associated with these bodies (i.e., whiteness), while attributing lower worth to nonwhite bodies, sense-making, and sensibilities. Therefore, those who embody the latter have to prove their worth in relation to the supposedly universal parameters established for and by this system of value. In this sense racism is not about ignorance of other people’s worth, but a mostly unconscious social overvaluation of whiteness as representative of more evolved and meritorious aspects of humanity that are driving progress and civilization universally.

When nonwhite people need to prove their worth, they need to show their contribution to the same “forward” of modernity that is almost never in question. In other words: if they cannot transform their physical bodies, they will need to perform white sense-making and sensibilities (including aspirations for the same “forward”) in order to be deemed worthy, to counter the deficit that has been socially imposed on them. The more efficiently nonwhite bodies mimic whiteness, the better chances they have of being considered “fully human,” of being seen as meritorious of modernity’s benefits and of being included in modern institutions.

What counts as “forward,” merit, or as bodies, or knowledge of universal worth is defined by parameters established by modernity that are not in question. Thus, antiracist strategies that are allowed a place within modernity are not about challenging the universal idea of “forward,” modernity’s criteria of merit, or the higher worth attributed to whiteness. These strategies can only exist within modernity if they show how nonwhite people have and can contribute to modernity’s program (i.e., how they can perform the sense-making and sensibility of whiteness), or how particular nonwhite groups should be accorded a higher worth within modernity as a form of redress for historical and systemic oppression (how a different sense and sensibility can still contribute to modernity’s progress). In the rare occasions when modernity’s “forward” is questioned, and the economy according a given higher value to whiteness is challenged, these challenges are met with demands for predefined alternatives that need to prove that they are “better” than modernity’s status quo, creating a circularity that is virtually impossible to break.

In previous chapters we touched upon modernity’s demands for certainty, authority, predictability, value, intelligibility, and “progress” that are associated with expectations of engineering reality according to human will. This would require anyone who problematizes modernity to offer a predefined alternative that performs modernity’s demands on modernity’s terms. We also touched upon how canonical figures are expected to establish universal parameters of understanding, and how hierarchies of knowledge and disciplines dictate the merit and worth of different contributions. Challenging all these cognitive frames at the same time is virtually impossible. To make this even more complicated, we need to remember that the cognitive domain is not the only domain that must be reconfigured if we are to lose our satisfaction with and interrupt harmful modern/colonial habits of being.

## Exercise

Think back to the CIRCULAR framework described at the end of the Prep Work 1 chapter, “Who the Heck Is Modernity?” How might the circular patterns identified there be related to an idealized version of humanity? How might those patterns renaturalize racial hierarchies, even when those enacting them are not consciously thinking about race? How might such patterns reproduce the idea of a single, universal “forward,” defined by whiteness, even when those enacting them are not white? How do the passengers on your bus respond to the notion that these patterns are harmful, but extremely difficult—if not impossible—to interrupt in ourselves?

A Hummingbird Teacher

Ten years after my experience with the schools in Aotearoa/New Zealand I was coming out of a meeting at my university in Canada, when something near the ground outside the building caught my attention. It was a low-lying tree branch with an upside-down hummingbird attached to it, its head almost touching the sidewalk. I nearly stepped on it. It was a very unusual sight, to put it mildly. I poked the body of the hummingbird and pronounced it dead. I didn’t want other people to step on it, or our resident coyote to eat it, so I faced a dilemma. I knew that my Indigenous partner at the time would not leave the body exposed, nor would my grandmother. As I pondered what to do in that context, I was also concerned that if people saw me collect the hummingbird’s body, they might consider it unsanitary or wrong in some way. I decided to pick up the hummingbird and wrap it in my scarf. I sang it a couple of songs and put it in my bag with the intention of taking it to my partner for smudging and a proper send-off.

However, I had to go to a meeting on the other side of the campus before going home. So, with a dead hummingbird in my bag, I proceeded to my lunch meeting. I forgot about the hummingbird until the end of the meeting when I remembered to show it to a colleague from Latin America—who I thought would understand why I had picked her up. When I opened my scarf the hummingbird was there, but one of her legs was twitching. First, I felt shocked by the bird’s resuscitation, and then I felt guilty because I could have harmed her. I ran to my office and called my partner on Skype to watch an awakening hummingbird who was slowly regaining strength.

My partner told me to wait for him at the office because he was coming to meet us. But as the hummingbird started to rehearse flying, I decided to walk her back to where I first saw her. On the way to that building we had to walk uphill, countercurrent, through a mass of students leaving their classes. She kept rehearsing her flight and seemed to hover over my scarf. I was walking in absolute awe, carrying a small miracle in my hands. I wanted everyone to see it. To my astonishment, nobody looked. I couldn’t believe it. People seemed absolutely absorbed in their own minds, as if their bodies only existed to transport their heads from place to place. A sentence from a text I had recently read came to mind. In this text colonialism was defined as a denial of relationship and as an atrophy of the senses.[^4]

As I approached the building, the hummingbird took off and vanished. I walked back to my office, blown away by the experience, to find my partner had arrived, disappointed he was too late to meet the hummingbird “in person.” He looked at the incident—as I did—as a very special gift, and he asked what I thought the hummingbird came to teach me. I started to look for that answer. This included some research on hummingbirds where I found out that my encounter had been with a male hummingbird who had come to Canada all the way from Mexico. I also read something that explained our encounter. When hummingbirds are exhausted or overwhelmed by external factors, they enter a state called torpor, where their system shuts down, keeping only 8% of their metabolism going in order to conserve energy. When we found each other, my hummingbird teacher was in a state of torpor.

As I reflected on this event, I thought that the hummingbird came to teach me about torpor, more specifically the torpor of the students who could not see the miracle of the hummingbird hovering over my scarf, as well as my own torpor. It was not lost on me that my elite institution was providing a kind of education that reproduces this torpor in its students, even as it ironically purports to prepare them to engage the world. However, this torpor leads to a very specific kind of engagement. This kind of torpor scales up our heads, our sense of self-importance, our sense of entitlement, our sense of control of everything, our sense that we are in a bubble that separates us from one another and protects us from the world. It is this sense of separation that presents the world as a threat, as something we need to be protected against.

This creates a form of existential poverty—which is a denial of relationship, a denial of entanglement, a denial that our lives (both human and nonhuman) are all interwoven. Existential poverty also leads to material poverty, as we try to protect ourselves from one another, and start to accumulate literal and symbolic “stuff” (e.g., possessions, credentials, status) as walls between ourselves. We think this stuff is going to give us the affirmation of individuality and security that we believe we are entitled to. The reality is that, beyond an initial sense of satisfaction, stuff usually doesn’t offer us a lasting sense of well-being. Thus, thanks to modernity’s wiring, we perpetually seek more stuff, always searching for the next thing. This perpetual loop also keeps us from realizing that the stuff we seek not only does not give us what it promises, but is also quite harmful. This includes harm to ourselves, and to others. In general, we don’t consider the true costs of that stuff for people involved in producing and providing it, and for the environment itself. In other words, we prefer not to see the relationship between our own existential poverty and how we are implicated in the material poverty of others, or between our existential poverty and ecological destruction.

Following my encounter with my hummingbird teacher, I started to think about what has been scaled down so that the head can be scaled up. What has been scaled down for me is our sense of visceral connection with one another. We have been taught to think about ourselves as much smaller and more limited than we actually are. I started to wonder about an education that could scale up what has been scaled down, that could un-numb the sense of visceral connection, and that could reactivate our visceral sense of accountability and responsibility toward everything.

Part of the problem with the kind of education we receive at university and schools is that we forget how to scale up the important things. We scale down things like generosity, compassion, and humility in order to be able to participate in a system that has given us a few gifts, but that depends on violence and unsustainability to be maintained. At that time, similar to the stories from Aotearoa/New Zealand, this encounter gave me deeper insights into how our modern system of education makes us want the world—which is complex, dynamic, and plural—to fit the predefined scripts in our heads that we use to interpret reality. The modern/colonial desire to know the world in order to control it leaves us unequipped to encounter it in its full complexity, plurality, movement, entanglement, and indetermination.

As the educational philosopher Gert Biesta suggests, when the world eventually refuses to fit these imposed categories and frustrates desires for certainty, coherence, authority, and control; those driven by such desires tend either to fixate even more on imposing order through universal categories or force, or to withdraw from the world through exile or self-harm.[^5] Today, as technology accelerates change and our society becomes exponentially more complex, the usual categories modernity has deployed to order the world have become extremely unstable. As a result, long-established expectations of order, safety, security, stability, and predictability that were created by modernity are becoming increasingly untenable. The logical response from modernity’s patterns of knowing is to impose more fixed meanings to control the rebellious world at any cost, to give up on the world through cynicism and nihilism, or to use violence against others or oneself.

## Exercise

Check your bus. How are your passengers doing? Do any of your passengers recall an encounter with an other-than-human being that taught them something important? In your experience of formal education, were you ever invited to think of animals or plants as teachers? How many passengers on your bus are in a state of torpor? How many passengers are living in existential poverty without realizing it? What caused the state of torpor on your bus? Are passengers in torpor afraid of waking up? How do your passengers feel about the idea that their existential poverty contributes to the material poverty of others?

Boxhead

Reimagining education as an awakening of the senses in ways that do not fall into the trap of dishonoring reason requires a deep understanding of what triggered torpor in the first place. Perhaps this, ironically, is where reason can play an important role. As I reflected on the teachings of the hummingbird, I tried to create an image that could be associated with torpor. My first drawing was a disproportionately large square box placed over the outline of a tiny body, represented as an unfinished line. I called it “Boxhead,” as seen in figure 5 (page 136), and since then it has been an important character and companion in several pedagogical experiments.

Boxhead is a creation of modernity. On your bus, you may find a collection of Boxheads: male, female; some seeking to be normal and functional within modernity; others may be divergent, “alternative,” or transgressive. Some Boxheads identify with and are invested in all aspects of modernity, others disidentify with certain aspects while identifying with or being invested in others (consciously or unconsciously). You could even have a Boxhead on your bus that identifies as trans, queer, feminist, antiracist, abolitionist, spiritual, nonbinary, and ecologically minded.

Boxheads aspire to unrestricted autonomy and to be engineers (or artisans) of reality. As engineers they can be extremely useful passengers, depending on the task to be performed. A Boxhead is probably the best passenger if the task at hand is to put together an Ikea shelf, solve a mathematical problem, or build an airplane. However, there are significant differences between building a plane and building relationships. Imagine what could go wrong if you try to build a plane without calculations and projections. Now think about what could go wrong if you try to build _relationships_ based on calculations and projections.

Boxheads on their own are also really bad at tackling complex and dynamic problems because they tend to focus on logic, form, and control (trying to make everything fit in a box) while missing nuance, perspective, and depth. My intention in putting a spotlight on Boxheads is not to demonize them but rather to evaluate how much space they take up on your bus, how much time they spend in the driver’s seat, to what extent they dictate your mode of relating to the world, and how your relationships may suffer as a result. The invitation is to see every Boxhead as an antagonist–teacher.

Boxheads have a specific mode of seeing and thinking in line with the Cartesian maxim “I think, therefore I am,” rather than “You are, therefore I am”[^6] or “We relate, therefore we are.” Thus, the Boxhead mode of existence reduces “being” to “knowing”—the security and value of being are grounded on the certainty and accuracy of knowing (in order to predict and control reality). Since the control of reality happens through indexing it in language, Boxheads are obsessed with meaning, so much so that the word used for everything that is important is _meaningful_ and things that cannot be codified in Boxheads’ language are deemed pointless or ludicrous. There are also other maxims that derive from the Cartesian _cogito ergo sum,_ including: “I say, therefore it is”; “I own, therefore I rule”; “I rock, therefore you suck.” But _all_ of the maxims may not be at work at the same time.

Figure 5: Boxhead

Boxhead’s frames and filters of perception engraved in the box represent the ways of reasoning that modernity authorizes as legitimate. These frames and filters define what kinds of thinking are legible, intelligible, and imaginable within modernity. In addition to Cartesian rationality, these modes of thinking and seeing include: logocentric, universalist, anthropocentric, teleological, utility-maximizing, dialectical, allochronic, and evolutionary modes of seeing and thinking. Here is a brief explanation of what is entailed by each of these modes:

- Logocentrism relates to the indexing of reality in language (i.e., “I say, therefore it is”).
- Universalism relates to the search for an objective and universal description of reality (i.e., “I think, therefore it is _all_ there is”).
- Anthropocentrism relates to the perception of humanity as separate from nature and having a mandate to own, manage, exploit, and control it (i.e., “I own, therefore I rule”).
- Teleological reasoning relates to establishing predefined goals for engineering the world and getting the greatest value for the energy spent (i.e., “I plan, therefore it will be”).
- Utility-maximizing is a transactional mode of reasoning that calculates action according to the greatest benefits to be gained (i.e., “I invest, therefore I benefit from it”).
- Dialectical thinking relates to a linear logic of progression (of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis) that is averse to paradoxes, complexities, and contradictions (i.e., “It is this, therefore it cannot be that”).
- Allochronic and evolutionary thinking relate to judging others according to criteria where oneself is represented as being in the present and at the apex of (linear) time and evolution (i.e., “I succeed because I am intelligent and strong, therefore you perish because you are unintelligent, uneducated, and weak,” in other words, “I rock, therefore you suck”).

As already mentioned, we must remember that not all these modes of seeing and thinking may be at work simultaneously—Boxhead may be critical of some of them, but for this critique to be intelligible, it will generally need to reproduce or even emphasize other authorized modes of seeing and thinking within modernity. For example, challenges to anthropocentrism can only be intelligible through a dialectical critique that must present an alternative to anthropocentric thinking that also reproduces utility-maximization or universalization. Forms of thinking or being that do not fit Boxhead’s box are perceived as nonsensical or nonexistent. When Boxheads want to “think outside the box,” they generally make the box bigger by turning other ways of being into something intelligible within modernity’s parameters of legibility.

However, there are at least two ways of relating to Boxhead’s image. One is to focus on the box itself and observe its dynamics in different ways, for example by asking what relationships, love, life, and death might look like within and outside of that box. Despite the limits of this exercise, there is a lot to be gained from these observations in terms of identifying the limits of the box. The other way to relate to Boxhead is to see the image as the movement of a line drawing a box and a body (rather than the box as a fact). This mode of relating to Boxhead is more interesting as it highlights aspects connected with the body and embodied experiences that can interrupt the drawing of the box, such as the other-than-human, the aesthetic, the ludic, the absurd, the hilarious, the erotic, and the divine.

Boxhead is also narcissistic. When Boxheads are shown something that does not fit in their box, they turn it into a mirror and by capturing the (self-) reflection of what is shown, they imagine that they have already “got it.” This cannot be interrupted by telling Boxheads that they are doing it—they need to catch themselves in the act in order to grow suspicious of their own desires and understandings, like the exercise about Narcissus described in chapter 5, “Surrendering Arrogance.” When that realization happens and the narcissistic mirror is broken, people start to notice that their analyses and solutions are already subordinate to their hopes and desires: they reflect modern attachments to progress, innocence, entitlement, and futurity. Without breaking the mirror that reflects our self-image back to us, it is impossible to access what lies beyond the scripts of the world as we know it.

## Exercise

Check your bus. To what extent have Boxheads been useful on your bus? To what extent have they been harmful—especially to your relationships? Who is driving your bus right now? Is it possible for you to tell if the current bus driver is a Boxhead? How would you know? To what extent do the passengers on your bus identify or disidentify with Boxhead? How would the Boxheads on your bus respond to having their mirrors broken? What would they do? How could their responses be guided in a generative way? Are there any passengers on your bus who could facilitate that? What would be necessary for Boxheads to take up less space on your bus without dishonoring their existence?

Surrendering Arrogance

Often arrogance is thought to be a trait that some people have and some don’t. However, arrogance is also a nonexclusive trademark of modernity. This means arrogance is imprinted in all of us who have been socialized within modernity and it can be interpreted as a cultural and systemic trait. Arrogance is an attitude of superiority based on an exaggerated sense of importance that demands audience and validation. It often manifests in combination with presumptuous claims about the superiority of one’s knowledge, status, power, or virtues. Arrogance takes root inside us, unconsciously, as we are conditioned by modernity’s hierarchies of worth of knowledges, cultures, institutions, persons, and other beings. These hierarchies rank everyone and everything against everyone and everything else. Whether we identify or not with these hierarchies, they still deeply condition how we feel about and relate to ourselves, to each other, and to the world.

Within modernity, arrogance trades on inferiority and superiority, usually—but not exclusively—in intellectual economies of worth. Investing in such stock is detrimental not only for your own health, but for the health of the relations and relationships around you. In other words, as long as you hold on to this economy, those closest to you will pay the price. Therefore, in hospicing modernity, it is important to disinvest from modernity’s arrogance in order to open up space for healthier relations and both individual and collective well-being. For this disinvestment to become possible, two things must happen. First, we need to identify the hidden traits of arrogance and trace them back to their incentive systems. Second, we need to lose the satisfaction we gain from the systemic benefits that arrogance affords us. In institutional cultures where arrogance is rewarded, disinvesting from arrogance is counterintuitive.

It is important to note that arrogance is institutionally normalized and socially rewarded when manifesting in certain bodies, but it is socially penalized when manifesting in others. At an individual level, for the person manifesting arrogance, it feels satisfying because it evokes pleasant feelings of high arousal associated with power, righteousness, rightfulness, and success. Therefore, many of us depend on arrogance for our sense of status, confidence, pride, authority, and control. Arrogance can also manifest as a coping strategy for our deeper insecurities, when we are trying to hide our fears of belittlement, insignificance, humiliation, or worthlessness. Arrogance can be interpreted as a symptom of the foundational ontological narcissism that emerges from separability.[^1]

Therefore, disinvesting from arrogance is not easy: it is a lifelong process that requires us to stop doing what feels and is rewarded as “normal.” The first step in this long journey is to identify the sources of arrogance within and around us. In this chapter I tell three stories that can help detect different types and workings of arrogance, using the context of the university as an example. I also include the sketches of an exercise that is still being designed, in order to invite academics to disinvest from academic arrogance.

Hierarchies of Knowledges, Cultures, and Bodies

Colonization involves the systematic belittlement and attempted elimination of Indigenous peoples’ knowledge and governance systems, so that settlers can have access to their land. Reconciliation efforts with Indigenous peoples in Canada require three things: a recognition of the violence committed against Indigenous people, initiatives to mitigate and redress that violence, and respect and accountability toward Indigenous peoples and their knowledge and governance systems. However, a culture cannot expect to reverse overnight more than two centuries of elevating and rewarding one knowledge system over another, while actively trying to destroy the other. Moreover, efforts to accord more value to Indigenous knowledge systems (often the result of efforts to counteract their systemic devaluation) commonly result in these knowledges being extracted, homogenized, misinterpreted, appropriated, and consumed in unethical ways.

Genuine efforts toward reconciliation require a surrender of what is pleasurable and rewarded in the university system: its sense of inherent benevolence, innocence, self-transparency, universality, and objectivity. Even if we remain committed to this work, it would take generations for these to be renegotiated and recalibrated in order for different knowledge systems to work together on a level playing field. In addition, this work is not easy because it is one thing to say that you are interested in reconciliation and already open to taking steps in that direction; it is another to actually do the difficult and uncomfortable work necessary for reconciliation to become a flicker of a possibility—including disinvesting from arrogance.

In 2015 I was a speaker at a conference on Indigenous knowledge systems in Alberta. The Indigenous scholars who were organizing the conference wanted to challenge the arrogance of the university, and create a space where the local Indigenous community felt welcome in a university building. Thus, this was an unusual conference for several reasons. First, it was intergenerational. This meant that elders, children, and families were not only invited, but that many efforts had been made to change the space, the pace, and the schedule of the conference to make it possible for them to be there in a healthy way. There was recognition that Indigenous people, especially those who had been forced to attend residential schools as children, experienced educational institutions as sites of hostility, humiliation, and trauma.

At this conference, communities were welcomed with ceremony and abundant food, which was available at all times. Indigenous young people from the local juvenile facility were also invited to the conference. Passes were made available and minders were organized in order for a small number of Indigenous people in prisons to participate. Some were even brought from the hospital to participate in the activities. Elders were assigned personal assistants that could attend to their needs from door to door. Activities for families and children were also an integral part of the program. As people listened to the speakers, they were invited to engage in beading, drawing, or weaving.

The speakers were selected according to whether they could be sensitive to the needs of the audience. They were asked to stay for the entirety of the conference, in order to build relations. Nobody who accepted the invitation to speak found that request unusual—they already knew that, in order for them to do their work well, they needed to be engaged in the slow and difficult work of building relationships based on trust, respect, reciprocity, consent, and accountability.

The conference started every day at seven in the morning with a smudging and peace pipe ceremony held by elders telling stories, for about two hours. We had breakfast together in a large circle, with everyone’s shoes off. In the middle of the laughter and nourishment of these meals, I almost forgot I was at a university. Just think about this for a minute, and consider the labor and negotiations required to organize such an event. To those who are not used to organizing events in this way, this kind of labor might not be visible. From the relationships with the communities (here I am not talking about community representatives or leaders, but elders, families, and people in prison) to the negotiation with university security personnel and fire marshals—including the negotiation of smudging and smoking protocols—the amount of labor it must have taken to make this conference possible was enormous. Many Indigenous people have considerable legitimate suspicion toward educational institutions (like schools and universities) that have played a role in colonization. The organizing team’s commitment to creating a space for Indigenous people to feel relaxed enough to learn together in the context of the university was incredible. And at every single step of this negotiation of space within the university, the people organizing this conference had to negotiate with arrogance, with the sense of superiority embedded in the established ways that are perceived to be normal and natural by everyone else. This work is hard and painful, and that fact mostly goes unrecognized.

During one of our lunches, I was late to the lunch queue. When I finished preparing my plate, I found that all the seats had been taken. A young man noticed me walking around with my food and offered me his seat at a table of eight young Indigenous males, all from the local juvenile facility. Suddenly all eight of them were waving at me to sit with them. I felt embarrassed in the spotlight, but could not turn away their offer. Thus, I sat with them and became the center of attention as I tried to eat. They thought I was also a young person, which was quite cute and put me more at ease. They asked me if I had finished high school. I said yes. They asked me what I did. I told them I was a teacher. They asked me if I taught kids at school. I told them that I worked at the university. Here I paused, as I knew that the usual immediate reaction from communities I have worked with is to assume that people who work at universities have a superiority complex that is virtually unbreachable. I did not want them to feel like that, but I could sense the mood changed a bit.

One of them, however, became really interested. He asked me what I taught, prefacing that with a smirky smile and saying, “I am interested in philosophy.” I said I worked in education. “Which area?” he asked. I paused again. I thought, how can I explain what I do in five seconds, in ways that might keep this conversation going in a positive way? So I said, “I think my job at the university is to try to gently convince very entitled privileged people who think they know everything to shed their arrogance voluntarily and realize what they are missing out on.” All the young people at the table lit up. The young man who had asked me the question said, “I know exactly what you do!” I told him, “That is good news if you have a name for it, because it is usually very hard to explain!” He said, “You work with anti-….” In my mind I was thinking, “He is going to say ‘antiracism.’” But I was overjoyed when he shouted next, “Anti-ASSHOLISM!” Everyone, including myself, burst out laughing. I replied, “Precisely! This is the best description I ever heard; can I borrow it?” He agreed. I said with a smile, “You know, anti-assholism starts at home, in my body. I need to start with my own assholism.” He replied, “Now you are making me look at mine.” I said, “You see, I am really good at my job!” We had a great lunch and I was gifted the best-ever description of my work, although it is not one I can often use at the institution where I work.

## Exercise

Given that arrogance is ingrained within our systems, most of us will embody it in one way or another. What kinds of arrogance manifest through you? For example: insistence on always being right; insistence on offering unsolicited opinions and explanations; insistence on having your knowledge accorded the highest value, having your credentials or the prestige of your institutions affirmed; insistence on being the arbiter of truth, morality, and justice for yourself or for others; insistence on having the first or last word. When these perceived entitlements are not met, how do you respond? Are you afraid of being silenced? Of being dethroned? Of losing legitimacy? Of becoming irrelevant? In what ways (if ever) have you addressed your own assholism? In what ways might the act of seeing yourself as not-arrogant be a sign of your own entrenched arrogance? Why is it generally difficult for us to look at our own arrogance, and easier to see it in others? How might your arrogance shape how you engage with the world and other people? Try to remember a situation where others saw you as arrogant. How could your arrogance have negatively affected others (both human and other-than-human)? Does your perspective on your own arrogance shift when you try viewing it from others’ perspectives? How might your arrogance negatively affect you? How might it affect your closest relationships (e.g., with your children, your parents, and your partner)? Check the anti-assholism memo[^2] for a list of suggestions if you are interested in this topic.

From the Ivory Tower to the Supermarket

There are different types of arrogance at the university. At least three of them are important to mention here. These are all grounded on hierarchies of knowledge and associated with white middle-class sensibilities, therefore they do not apply only to academics. The first arrogance type I call “the smarts,” the sense that because we work or study at a university, we are exceptional people (exceptionally intelligent, well-educated, and virtuous) who are uniquely positioned to see reality more objectively than everyone else and to suggest (or impose) steps to improve it. We feel we can and should codify the world to our hearts’ content using our particular cultural referents, thinking we are doing it with neutrality, objectivity, innocence/benevolence, and universal relevancy. Then, especially if we come from or work at elite institutions, we feel we can and should impose these codifications on others around us and the world at large, and expect only gratitude and recognition in return.

This also relates to the second arrogance type that I call “the throne.” This is the ingrained sense that we are “righteous people” whose position of authority and status as arbiters of truth, justice, morality, progress, and common sense was justly earned and therefore is well deserved because we are innocent, hardworking people who have the best possible intentions. We also feel this status is constantly under threat (with some good reason), and therefore this position needs to be continuously defended and reaffirmed, using multiple strategies of taking space.

The perceived entitlement to taking space leads me to the third arrogance type, which I call “the stage,” an arrogance related to our sense of entitlement to a captive audience. Thus, the formula is simple: we have the smarts (we are exceptionally intelligent, the most virtuous, and best educated), therefore we deserve both the throne (authority and arbitration) and the stage (a captive clapping audience grateful for our opinions about all that really matters—which affirms and takes us back to “the smarts”).

These three arrogances are also more pronounced in a specific generation of academics born before social media and neoliberalism changed the reality of the university and also changed how people relate to time, speed, spectacle, work, and information. For a brief moment I have to put on my academic hat to explain how the threats to academic privilege, autonomy, and authority contribute to an exponential increase in arrogance, especially in academic spaces. This serves as an illustration of how any perceived threats to privilege, authority, and autonomy may contribute to an increase in arrogance as a form of self-defense. The existential crisis of the university is used here as an example.

Zygmunt Bauman[^3] identifies three trends that have led to an existential crisis for the university. First, he says, the handing over of the integrative function of states to the market has led to deregulation, privatization, and the commodification of identity formation. Since new hierarchies of authority, prestige, and influence are created through the management of public attention, universities lose their ability to have an independent identity from the market. Second, Bauman states that digital technology has fundamentally changed the control of sources of and access to knowledge, which become deregulated, privatized, and financialized. As a result, the monopoly and privilege of universities in value creation and selection become no longer tenable, the bid for deference to academic knowledge is rendered invalid, and this is a heavy blow to the status and prestige of universities. Third, the pace of change renders occupational knowledge and skills obsolete much quicker, which means that it is more reasonable and cost effective for companies to do on-the-job training than to wait for academics to catch up with the pace of change in society. This in turn contributes to a decrease of public investment in universities as providers of occupational training. The universities are perceived more as a temporary shelter from unemployment and a service provider that attends to the needs of the middle class.

In this context, the ivory tower is turned into a supermarket of credentials, where students exercise their rights as customers. There is a specific generation of customers who were brought up with a higher sense of voice and entitlement and who are pushing for further change—not necessarily with the best methods—but they are here to stay. Some of these students may demand that legacies of colonialism stop being celebrated or that the curriculum be changed to include voices that have been historically marginalized, while other students demand not to be exposed to issues that challenge their privilege or perspective. Some of the changes demanded are in line with what the families of these students, at home or abroad, stand for; but some are not and can actually place students in a difficult position if they return to their home countries. Some students and faculty advocate for more restrictive antiracist policies and codes of behavior, while others advocate for more academic freedom—including the freedom to offend. While there are many people who still defend the virtues of arrogance, in many contexts, arrogance (especially the presumption of all-knowingness and all-righteousness) has not only lost its purchase, but has become a liability—people can lose their jobs if their arrogance gets out of hand. In the midst of all this, the university is also being attacked by other sectors of society that resent its elitism, sometimes in dangerous (anti-scientific, anti-intellectual, “post-truth”) ways.

There is a significant gap between the generation of students described so far and the generation of faculty members invested in the three types of arrogance mentioned above (i.e., the smarts, the throne, the stage). In this intergenerational gap, a meta-change has occurred. Zygmunt Bauman describes this meta-change as a change in the depth and scope of societal fragmentation, and in the fashion and speed of change. These two factors exponentially increase the layers of complexity in any given situation. In this context of life fragmentation, dispersal of authority, polyphony of value messages, and juxtaposed games whose short-lived rules change as we go; Bauman identified two pathways for universities. One pathway would be to reject the new rules of the market and build a fortress of esoteric language and obscure theory, withdrawing and isolating within a self-sufficient boutique “mini-market.” Another pathway would be to accept and submit to the market, seeing the university as a business enterprise, with the marketability of commodities (curricula, courses, degrees) as the key criterion. Bauman asserted that both pathways meant surrender: the second pathway meant submitting to a market hierarchy of relevance; while the first pathway meant accepting a market-imposed social and cultural irrelevance. Most of my colleagues (and students) understandably are confused and frustrated by the limitations of these options.

## Exercise

Can you think of similar challenges to established authorities, singular universal truths, and dominant worldviews in your profession, discipline, or area of practice? Where are these challenges _perceived_ to be coming from? Where are they _actually_ coming from? How do you know? What are the possible consequences of these challenges for your work and more generally, for society? How do people generally respond to these challenges? How might you respond to these challenges with dexterity and integrity, as well as discernment and accountability (to multiple different communities)? In the current context, what might it be important to hold onto, and what might be important to let go?

No Ethical Crisis

Arrogance is not an isolated institutional issue—it is part and parcel of historical and systemic patterns of modern society. Arrogance as an individual trait is often rewarded in institutions and for the most part, the arrogance of institutions is also normalized and naturalized. Below I will tell a story that illustrates how arrogance was not just normalized, but repressively enforced by the institutional apparatus at a university. In this example, we can see that arrogance is not an abstract concern but a very real cultural condition that is policed (literally), often with violent consequences.

In 2018 I witnessed the arrest of a young Indigenous person in front of the building where my office is located at the university. His “crime” was that he was homeless and that he should not exist on our business grounds—which, by the way, are located on the unceded territory of the Musqueam Indigenous people. If you have never been to Vancouver, there is more background to this story that you might need to know. Downtown Eastside of Vancouver is a vibrant, diverse, and strong community threatened by gentrification, with a large population of immigrants, Indigenous, low–income, and homeless people. My university, on the other side of the city, is surrounded by rainforests that reach the sea, and is home mainly to wealthy Canadian and international students. It is also where the famous clothing-optional Wreck Beach is located. For people to get to this public beach, they need to go through my university. Here is where arrogance gets normalized, institutionalized, even policed. There is an overwhelming (though generally unspoken) consensus at the university that having homeless people on university grounds is bad for business for a number of different reasons; this is virtually indisputable. The solution then is to have the police temporarily arrest people who cross the grounds who don’t look like they belong at the university, depriving them of their right to transit through and access public beaches (again, on Indigenous land), and to take them back to the Eastside.

On the day of this arrest I was exiting a meeting in my department building with another Indigenous professor when we saw, through a large window, the rare sight of a young Indigenous person in pajama pants sitting on the other side of the street. As we noticed him, we heard sirens and saw the reflection of red lights. The young person was startled. My heart started racing. Within seconds, two police cars arrived, blocking his way on either side of the street. A third police car appeared, blocking another possible exit. I wanted to run toward the scene. My Indigenous colleague held me back. “Are you insane?” he asked. He was often profiled and followed by the police on university grounds. “Look at you [he pointed to my reflection on the window]! You will be arrested with him before you can explain anything. Witness from here. Where is your phone?” My heart sank. Neither of us had our phones on us. The building corridors were empty. We watched the scene unfold through the window.

The young man was approached by three officers. It was a busy walkway. People kept walking through or around the scene. Nobody stopped for him. Three police cars, lights on, an Indigenous young person in SpongeBob pajama pants, three officers surrounding him. Nobody stopped for him. People went on with their business as if nothing was happening, no ethical crisis. We saw two of our racialized colleagues who work on issues of social justice exiting another building from our side of the street. My heart was lifted—they would definitely do something. They walked toward the scene, talking to each other. They stopped for a bit and looked in the other direction. They walked away from the scene either to avoid the inconvenience or to avoid being arrested. My heart sank into my shoes.

A white colleague was leaving her office in our building. She approached us and wanted to know what the commotion was. I begged her to go and be a witness. She agreed. She went outside as we observed from the inside and after two minutes, she signaled for me to join her. Perhaps if she was there, with a phone, it would also be safe for me to be there with her. She would be able to explain if the police wanted to arrest me as well. My Indigenous colleague still did not want me to go, but he couldn’t stop me. When I arrived at the scene, we listened. Another two minutes and my white female colleague told me she couldn’t stay because she had to pick up a child from school. She said goodbye and left me there alone in the middle of it. I could see that my Indigenous colleague inside the building was worried. I signaled for him to stay where he was and observe from a distance. It was too late to change anything. What happened next is described in the following text, “Heavy Rain,” which I wrote to process the situation and the frustrations within me.

**Heavy Rain**

Loud sirens. Red lights. Police cars. Three officers out. One in the car.

Young Indigenous person approached. Drops what looked like a walking stick.

Brown (check); Indigenous (check); Young (check); Male (check); Poor (check); Possibly homeless (check); Harassed (check); Angry (check); NOT GOOD (check).

He needs a witness.

Heart racing. Brown (check); Immigrant (check); Triggered (check); I CAN’T BE A WITNESS (check).

“It could have been my son! It could have been one of my relatives.”

My Indigenous colleague reminds me that the police often follow him around campus—they do as they always have done, he says, touching hauntings of memories and memories of naturalized violence; reminders of trauma, of history, of broken backs stacked as bridges for others to climb.

Questions at the back of our minds: Will the label “professor” outweigh the embodied liabilities? Will it appease the activated anxieties? Will it be able to cast a shield of protection over the young man? Will the casting of the shield be worth the risk?

We watch. From the building. Through the glass. Many people pass by. They choose to ignore it.

Heart racing.

Deep breath of relief: two racialized professors who work on social justice issues walk toward the scene. They will do something. Nope. They choose to avoid it.

A white colleague appears. She agrees to go. She calls me to join her. We listen. Someone had called the police: we cannot have a young brown Indigenous man in SpongeBob pajama pants spinning a stick at an elite university.

RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police]: “What is your name? Can I see your ID? What are you doing here? Where do you live? Where are you going?”

Young Man: “Don’t need to answer any of that. Have not done anything wrong. You can’t force me. I know the law. I haven’t broken it.”

Correct.

He knows the drill. One of the officers uses the radio. My colleague says he is calling for reinforcement: they will arrest him.

A woman approaches us: “He is drunk,” she says. “No, he is not,” I say to myself. She leaves. She might have been the one who called the cops.

RCMP: “Why do you have a stick?”

YM: “I am an artist. I am dyslexic. Stick spinning is my art. I do acrobatics. You are harassing me because you think I don’t belong here, but this is a public institution and this street is a public space. You are not stopping other kids. The reason you stopped me is called systemic racism.”

Correct. Smart (check); Dis/ability (check).

My colleague has to leave. I stand alone outside as a witness. Inside the building, I see my friend watching, worried about how everything will unfold.

RCMP: “You should study to be a police officer.”

YM: “That is the last thing I would want to be. RCMP’s history dates back to the Hudson’s Bay Company who wiped out whole nations because of greed. Are you proud to serve an institution responsible for genocide?”

RCMP: “These are your beliefs.”

YM: “What do you believe?”

RCMP: “We will need to escort you off of campus.”

YM: “What have I done?”

RCMP: “What is in your bag?”

A white teddy bear sticks out of his bag.

YM: “My electronics. Nothing dangerous or illegal. I have not done anything wrong. You cannot force me to do anything....”

Correct.

An officer approaches me.

RCMP: “Do you know this man? Did you call the police?”

Me: “I did not call the police. I am a professor here.”

YM: “She is my witness. I am cold, I need to go.”

Me to YM: “Come with me. Let’s have something to eat.”

RCMP walks toward me to stop me from getting close to the young man: “Please step away from him. I will talk to you later.”

Two other officers take the opportunity to approach the young man. He is made to stand up. His hands are forced to his back. His body is forced against the police car. He is handcuffed. His body searched. His bag opened; contents exposed. Three teddy bears and a couple of headphones.

Young Indigenous man arrested for being Indigenous. Just another day in Canada.

I notice an officer taking my picture from a distance.

About to enter the car, handcuffed, the young man shouts to me:

“Thanks for trying.”

RCMP just following its mandate, its social function, its duty.

Who would want people from East Van hanging out this side of town, right?

“place and promise” effectively sanitized.

“student learning, research excellence, and community engagement”

I look around: no ethical crisis, just aesthetic disturbance.

He watches me. From the police car. Through the glass.

My picture is taken again. This time not from a distance.

A heavy rain starts.

Would writing up this story risk my own security?

What, if anything, can un-numb us?

One of the things this story makes clear is that there are significant implications and consequences when arrogance is not just a personal trait, but rather becomes a systemically enforced privilege of certain groups of people. In this case, institutional arrogance was weaponized with the assistance of the police. Legally, the young man had done nothing wrong, but that did not stop him from being harassed and removed. Nonetheless, it is significant to note that for many people whose arrogance is systemically sanctioned, they perceive it as their entitlement to have their authority and arbitration not merely affirmed, but actually codified into law. Certainly, it is codified into the norms and everyday interactions of the university.

To conclude this section, I invite you to consider the implications and consequences of what happens when arrogance is no longer just a personal trait, but a systemically enforced privilege of certain groups of people. What are the costs of systemically enforced (sanctioned) arrogance? Who pays the highest price for this arrogance? Whose responsibility is to resist it? How can we resist systemic arrogance without resisting from a position of our own arrogance? What are the differences in price of resistance (or solidarity) for different social groups? For whom is resisting institutionalized arrogance a choice, and for whom is it a matter of survival? What would have happened if a white (male) senior academic would have come to the scene and said: “Excuse me officers, this young man is with me, and I can vouch for his presence on these grounds”? Why don’t such things happen often? What would it take for more people to notice the injustice of such a scene? What would it take for them not just to notice, but also to intervene? Would you have been able to notice the arrogance and the violence before hearing the story? Why? Why not? Would you have felt compelled to intervene?

Hierarchies between Disciplines

If the university can be understood as a site of institutional arrogance, systemically backed arrogance is nonetheless unevenly distributed within its walls between different disciplines and fields of study. Around the same time of the conference in Alberta, I participated in a yearlong program at an interdisciplinary center at my university. We had to present our research to one another, work in clusters, and address problems of collective concern together. Hierarchies of disciplines were made immediately clear: people in medicine were the most important, of course; and people in STEM perceived their methods, funding, and sense of objectivity to grant them second place in the intellectual hierarchies. People in humanities and social sciences, concerned with displays of erudition, were third place; and those in education and social work were perceived to be there for the food. (I am only half-joking.)

It seemed that for those in medicine and STEM, the humanities were there as an elite form of entertainment. It was interesting to observe how what my colleagues in the humanities produced was consumed as a form of cultural capital accumulation. In this way, their scholarship was perceived as valuable, although not in the same way or to the same degree as scientific and medical scholarship. Meanwhile, as soon as the social scientists began to expose complexities of one sort or another, the scientists and engineers were very happy to offer “solutions” they thought were ingenious and that no one else could have possibly considered.

While my colleagues in the scientific, medical, and engineering fields assumed that those in other fields could never comprehend their work, this did not go both ways; they assumed that they could easily be experts in the social sciences, humanities, social work, and education. When my social work colleagues would try to describe the paradoxes of their work, several people felt that they could explain the problems better than the person who was actually in that field. If obscure language appeared in presentations of scientists, medical doctors, and engineers, it was a sign of rational rigor and the fact that they were studying something important that most of us wouldn’t understand. When technical language appeared in presentations of lower status disciplines, we were told we were not effective communicators, and that we needed to speak in “plain language” since anyone could be an expert in the kind of work we did. This dynamic is in the DNA of our institutions and is very much connected to the three arrogances described before: the smarts, the throne, and the stage.

My interdisciplinary cluster consisted of me, an Indigenous political science scholar, and a brilliant Latin American scientist who was a racialized woman. This Latin American scientist’s breakthrough in science came with her unique ability to see viruses differently. Rather than looking at viruses using metaphors of drilling machines approaching the nucleus of cells, she challenged common sense and approached the virus and the cells as interdependent beings negotiating a relationship. This slight shift of perception had enormous consequences in her field and resulted in new pathways of research into how cells “relate,” “collaborate,” and form “partnerships.” We had to present something together to the larger group. She proposed that our cluster should focus on the problem of lack of creativity in science education. Our Indigenous colleague proposed that we add complicities in colonialism and lack of accountability of science as well. We all agreed to do that. We would each present on the same topic, using the knowledge of our own disciplines.

On the day of the presentation, my Latin American scientist colleague went first. As soon as she mentioned the lack of creativity in science education, other scientists jumped in to contest that premise. They thought that science was super-creative (since they saw themselves as super-creative) and implied that she was the one who had a creativity block. They suggested that she should learn how to teach using the latest problem-solving techniques and audience-response clickers. From their perspective, this would solve everything. My Latin American colleague was taken by surprise and did not know how to respond to the avalanche of criticisms. She could not even finish her presentation, which might actually have helped her colleagues in science better understand what she meant. From my discipline I could easily spot the racial, gender, and geopolitical forms of discrimination operating in that room, but I knew that if I brought this up in my presentation I would be attacked and dismissed as well—regardless of the accuracy of my critique or my communication skills. So, I decided not to intervene on that day. We had to plan another session for the next week in a more conversational style. This, I thought, was my opportunity.

I could see that people in our group and in other similar academic settings were attached to the idea that only their way of seeing was valid because it was institutionally validated, rewarded as neutral and objective, and accorded universal relevancy. This presumably universal modality of knowing/being assumes a distinction between humans and nature; places “modern man” at the apex of human evolution and in a position of universal neutral, unbiased objective gaze; and expects descriptions that can accurately index reality, and prescriptions that can effectively control reality. This modality also presumes that knowledge accumulation is relatively seamless, unequivocal, and dialectical; that canonical figures should establish universal parameters of understanding; and that hierarchies of knowledge and disciplines are based on the merit accumulated in relation to their contribution to “progress.” Embodying such a modality is part of the training and socialization of most academics and they never really have to think about explaining it to others. After all, that is how they—and presumably everyone else—should “objectively” perceive reality.

However, that is not how this modality is perceived by people who have been socialized in other(ed) modalities. The presumed universality of this modality of knowing/being poses enormous challenges for the “inclusion” of other(ed) knowledges in academia. For example, when these other(ed) knowledge systems—including Indigenous knowledge systems—are offered some space in the conversation (and benevolently accorded “knowledge” status), they always must translate themselves into the parameters and knowledge hierarchies of the universalized modality (even if they are critical of them) in ways that are intelligible to those who “included” them in the first place. This has been a no-win situation because modern contexts of “dialogue” are still characterized by a sensibility of conquest (of convincing others that one side has a better universal proposition than the other), which may not be the terms of conversation of the modality being “included.” In this context, other(ed) knowledges are frequently dismissed on two grounds. Most frequently, they are interpreted as too similar and therefore irrelevant and incapable of offering any substantial thing of value to “progress.” Alternatively, they are deemed too different and unintelligible, which either renders them irrelevant (again) or places them in a position where their credentials are subject to constant scrutiny by those who can evaluate them in allegedly neutral, objective, and universal ways.[^4]

Taking these things into account I designed an educational exercise that could potentially help my colleagues to see the self-referential nature of the supposedly universal modality of knowledge production that is privileged in academic contexts, particularly in disciplines considered to be of higher status. On the day of the workshop I told my peers I would give them a scenario (described below) with an educational problem that they could try to solve with the “latest problem-solving techniques” they had mentioned the week before.

You are the teacher of Narcissus. Narcissus transforms into a mirror everything that he sees, including everything that you show him. This means that he can never see what he is being shown, because he is always looking only at the reflections of the projections of his mind. And he also cannot see himself doing that or accept that he is doing it when you point that out. Your task as a teacher is to find a way to show Narcissus that he is doing what he is doing so that he can interrupt the pattern and learn to relate to a world beyond himself. How do you do that? Most importantly, as you perform this exercise and start to unpack its symbolic layers, your task is also to observe your responses; (e.g., joy, frustration, etc.) and to learn from them. Do not invest in your responses, just observe what is happening as physical sensations in your body (e.g., discomfort, arousal, pleasantness, unpleasantness, etc.). The exercise intends to draw your attention to unconscious patterns, desires, and denials that need to be examined.

At first, everyone was excited about trying to solve the scenario with their problem-solving techniques. I had asked the groups to tell me when they thought they had an answer, and every time they did, I would role-play Narcissus in the scenario presented and tell the group they needed to find another solution. One solution, for example, was to use irrefutable empirical evidence to show Narcissus that his perception of reality was distorted. I role-played Narcissus using a “rigorous scientific methodology” to falsify the evidence. Another solution offered was to explain narcissism to Narcissus using established psychological knowledge. I role-played Narcissus, saying that he considered himself an expert on narcissism and therefore claiming that the definition presented was wrong. Another solution was to convince Narcissus through rational argument that his perspective is biased and limited. I role-played Narcissus, refusing the terms for a conversation where his universalism was delegitimized from the outset. The point I was trying to get across was that Narcissus would always use the tools of the disciplines and of the system to seek out counterevidence and counterarguments to support his position. The system had groomed Narcissus to be the expert and to win the argument.

Another interesting solution presented was to get a number of people to tell Narcissus that he was not as beautiful as he thought. I role-played Narcissus feeling really hurt and becoming even more entrenched in his position due to the emotional distress. I explained that, if this continued to happen, his ego would be so hurt that he would feel he had only two options: 1) if he could not be the expert or have the stage, he would feel like he was being destroyed and he would not go down peacefully; or 2) he would rationalize his fantasy in ways that negate the rationalization in order to continue to enjoy the ego-logical benefits that the narcissistic delusion affords.

After a while, and many solutions refuted, one of the scientists in the group looked at me from the opposite side of the room and said, “This is about us, isn’t it? We are not the teachers of Narcissus; we _are_ Narcissus.” Everyone stopped talking. I responded: “This is an interesting interpretation; shall we see what it can teach us if we sit with it?” What followed was described by some of the scientists as the deepest and most difficult conversation we had had in that entire year. A senior medical researcher in the room named it immediately: “It’s our arrogance! We are destroying everything with it. It is ingrained and rewarded in our systems.” I remember thinking to myself: “Yes, you are all super-smart; now be courageous and use it well, with humility! You can say things I cannot say and do things I cannot do! Be brave and call it out! Do something about it!”

For a short part of that afternoon, we managed to have a conversation that was not about vanity projects or desires for authority, arbitration, self-congratulation, and self-satisfaction. A professor of economics started a cost–benefit calculation: If we lose the arrogance, what do we gain? How can we motivate people to lose their arrogance if arrogance is rewarded in the system, if the system selects for it, and if people work on the principle of self-interest? Can we change the reward mechanism? For me the most important question they should be asking was: What does arrogance do and how does this prevent me from being a better scientist, a better colleague, a better teacher, a better partner, a better parent, a better human being? But that question was not voiced that day. Instead, it became the seed for an exercise that would be designed five years later and that you are invited to engage with (see tables 3 and 4, below).[^5]

The Case for Academia **_with/out_** Arrogance

This is an attempt to make a case—a relational cost–benefit analysis–for academics considering the possibility of academia without arrogance, where four things become possible:

1. We can have conversations that do not reproduce to the same extent the harmful hierarchies of modernity.
2. We do not idealize or romanticize any discipline or knowledge system.
3. We can be deeply respectful while also highly skeptical of our own and different worldviews.
4. We combine relational and rational forms of rigor for better research, teaching, and service.[^6]

## Exercise

The exercise is simple: study the infographics for just three minutes, then turn the page and try to reconstruct the chart with the words provided and what you can remember. This will force you to think through the logic of the chart for yourself. You might even come up with new additions to the lists of three (and ten) words. As you do this, pay attention to what emerges for you in your mixed responses to the exercise. Check what makes you feel connected, compelled, demotivated, resistant, or defensive. Allow yourself to be positively surprised by the exercise and try to avoid deconstructing it preemptively. Let the exercise work with you, pay attention to the “3 good news” and the “10+ joys.”

Write down any questions and your final cost–benefit analysis. Would choosing to do the difficult work necessary for you to voluntarily shed your arrogance be a reasonable choice for you right now?

Check your bus. Check the passengers who are tired of the old patterns and ready to dig deeper and relate wider. Check the passengers holding on to arrogance or other habits of being that are clearly causing harm to your relations or your own sanity and vitality. What could be the reason for their resistance? What’s the tally? You just need 51% of your energy behind this to make it work. Resistance, paradoxes, complexities, doubts, and contradictions are all very normal parts of the process, so don’t let them stop you.

Getting to Zero

Black queer feminist poet and scholar Jacqui Alexander points out that modernity’s separability creates dismemberment and fragmentation in our bodies and our unconscious at individual and collective levels. Jacqui argues that this dismemberment and fragmentation generate “a yearning for wholeness, often expressed as a yearning to belong, a yearning that is both material and existential, both psychic and physical, and which, when satisfied, can subvert, and ultimately displace the pain of dismemberment.”[^1] She suggests that strategies of membership in coalitions—like those of citizenship, community, family, political movement, nationalism, and solidarity in identity or ideology—although important, cannot address the source of this yearning. Fundamentally, these coalitions reproduce the very fragmentation and separation that she identifies as the root of the problem. She explains:

As human beings we have a sacred connection to each other, and this is why enforced separations wreak havoc in our Souls. There is a great danger then, in living lives of segregation. Racial segregation. Segregation in politics. Segregated frameworks. Segregated and compartmentalized selves. What we have devised as an oppositional politics has been necessary, but it will never sustain us, for while it may give us some temporary gains (which become more ephemeral the greater the threat, which is not a reason not to fight), it can never ultimately feed that deep place within us: that space of the erotic, that space of the Soul, that space of the Divine.[^2]

Similar to Jacqui Alexander, Denise Ferreira da Silva writes about the limits of the frames of politics and thinking within modernity, and the need to gesture beyond them. She suggests that “an ethico-political program that does not reproduce the violence of modern thought requires … the end of the world as we know it.”[^3] She argues that this would demand that we release our imagination from the grips of certainty and the categorical thinking produced by Western philosophy and the violence it authorizes against nonwhite and nonhuman beings. Denise makes a distinction between experiencing the world as an “Ordered World” (of the European Enlightenment) and the “World as a Plenum,” where every form of existence is entangled beyond linear temporality and spatial separation.

That being said, the forms of politics that can be effective in negotiating power within modernity must necessarily be articulated through colonial frames in order to be legible. These colonial frames are inevitably grounded on exceptionalism (seeing certain groups as exceptional or extraordinary to elevate their worth), exaltedness (seeking the validation of this group’s greatness and contributions to progress in order to justify their merit and authority), and emancipation (the expansion of modern/colonial entitlements as a form of reward or goal of struggle). This form of politics can be very useful for harm reduction in the “Ordered World” of modernity, but it cannot interrupt the root causes of systemic harm because it necessarily underscores and reinforces human exceptionalism and separability, reproducing precisely the dismemberment and fragmentation that Jacqui and Denise warn us against.

Pajé Barbosa Pitaguary, from the Pitaguary Indigenous community in Brazil, says that both separability and the different hierarchies it generates within modernity produce a fundamental sense of insecurity—based on fears of worthlessness and belittlement—that is buried deep in our unconscious. These fears create a dynamic where we have only two choices: we either see ourselves as “plus one” (more than others) or “minus one” (less than others). Because we are haunted by the fear of being “minus one” (and feeling like trash), we spend much of our time seeking either external or internal validation for being “plus one” (however it is defined in our context). Pajé Barbosa emphasizes that the only way out of this dynamic is “getting to zero,” undoing the sense of separability and (human) superiority that modernity instills, experiencing existence and the world as a plenum, as Denise talks about, and fulfilling the yearning for wholeness that Jacqui describes. Getting to zero would require the end of the world as we know it, within and around us—a world founded precisely on separability.

My understanding is that working toward getting to zero means that we need to see all human knowledge as limited, culturally bound, and equivocal. This requires noticing that the desire for certainty, for all-encompassing knowledge, is in the same harmful cluster of the desires to conquer, consume, and control that have created the colossal mess driving us toward human extinction. In getting to zero we recognize that we don’t know everything, we cannot know everything, we are not a special species, and there is a bio-intelligence in the living planet-metabolism itself that is much older and larger than what human intelligence can fathom. As we start getting to zero, we will need to clear out the things that have cluttered our existence in modernity so that this bio-intelligence can begin to work through us in more profound ways, through the gifts and medicines we carry.

“Zero” is where we face and embrace both unlimited responsibility and accountability—responsibility to continuously compost our individual and collective shit in order to be available to this bio-intelligence. In this space, we sense more deeply our accountability to those, both human and nonhuman, whose lives were taken so that we could live. This accountability compels us not to waste other people’s time and life-force, and not to increase labor unnecessarily for other people or beings. “Zero” is where we sit before the immeasurable mess we have created and choose the path of collective healing over the path of collective self-destruction. It is through the process of getting to zero that we might learn to breathe and to be water, together.

Getting to zero is an ethico-political compass for hospicing modernity. However, it is very difficult (if not impossible) to get to zero from where we currently are. In order to be oriented by this compass, we need to have a deeper understanding of how the plus one/minus one dynamic structures relationships in general, especially those between dominant and marginalized communities in our current contexts.

Within modernity’s hierarchies of worth, difference is understood either as the deviation from a desirable norm (i.e., difference perceived as a liability) or something that can be selectively consumed by the dominant population for individual self-actualization or institutional branding (i.e., difference perceived as an asset). In both approaches to difference, the dominant population protects the general proposition that asserts hierarches of worth—“plus one”/“minus one”—and they specifically protect their claim over the “plus one” position in that hierarchy. However, in the latter example, they offer highly conditional access to the “plus one” position for a small percentage of people in the marginalized (“minus one”) population.

The second approach to difference, based on selective consumption, is also at work in liberal spaces committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) through strategies of representation, recognition, and redistribution. These strategies are framed as if they reflect the benevolence of the dominant group, but Sara Ahmed[^4] has documented how efforts to promote diversity within modern institutions, like universities, are mobilized to keep the same system and structures firmly in place. In addition, the logic of modernity selects for and lifts diverse people who are on board with its programs and invested in its economies, rather than those who have a different idea of “forward.” When those who cannot fit modernity’s molds end up in modern institutions, the experience of “inclusion” can be quite violent and painful.

In this chapter I share stories of events, collaborations, and artistic practices that illustrate the complexities, paradoxes, and conditionalities of inclusion into modern spaces and institutions. I invite you to consider how these stories problematize the “plus one”/“minus one” dynamic of inclusion, and to what extent efforts to illustrate this dynamic can support those who are trying to negotiate it within modern institutions.

Brutal Kindness

As I started writing this book, I was reluctant to talk about myself or to include personal stories in it. Nonwhite people—women in particular—have different reasons why they may not enjoy being expected to talk about their lives, their traumatic experiences, or even their achievements. Exposure and vulnerability, in this case, represent a high level of risk, and create many opportunities for misinterpretation and judgment. The risks of being disbelieved, disqualified, pigeonholed, misunderstood, deficit-theorized (perceived as inept, uneducated, or incompetent), accused of using an “oppression card” for advancements, or suspected of cheating the system are real and very high. Contrary to popular belief, the privilege of being a university professor also becomes a liability when I am perceived to occupy a position of authority that I do not deserve or do not have the natural right to occupy. This liability manifests also in cases when I disclose my own experiences of racism at the university and many of my colleagues assume that either I am making it up or exaggerating—surely someone in my position of “authority” would be immune to or protected from such things.

Furthermore, in some contexts there is an expectation that people from oppressed and marginalized groups in mainstream society will tell their stories for other people’s consumption, usually as a part of the tax and toll for “being included” in specific spaces. What is generally expected is a story of trauma and of heroic overcoming of trauma that legitimizes the person as worthy of being included, as a role model that can inspire others to “get over it” and “move on.” These stories of successful overcoming of trauma and subsequent inclusion are perceived to absolve institutions from their complicity in systemic harm. Having one’s stories instrumentalized, commodified, and consumed can be painful and retraumatizing. Stories can also be weaponized against the person who told the story. These trends are, unfortunately, the norm.

In addition, cultures that have been historically oppressed and marginalized within modernity tend to develop different forms of disidentification with dominant (often white, middle class) sensibilities as a form of resistance. This includes resistance to dominant forms of credibility and legitimacy building, especially for those engaged in high-intensity struggles who can identify the hypocrisies and harmful impacts of modernity from miles away. Their sensibility is often grounded on practices that encourage humility and more horizontal connections, and discourage the centering of the self—which is what is expected in Western institutions and projected as universally desirable. Thus, in these contexts, name-dropping, posturing, or listing one’s virtues or credentials can be easily perceived as attention-seeking and elevating oneself above others (i.e., buying into and reproducing the “plus one”/“minus one” dynamic described above). Thus, the narratives necessary to build my legitimacy and credibility as a university professor before my academic peers are precisely the narratives that could frame me, standing before Indigenous community relations, as personally invested in an oppressive dominant culture. Presenting myself as a university professor in these contexts tends to create (justifiable) suspicions about my motivations and maturity.

At this interface between communities with vastly different sensibilities, orientations, and investments, some people choose to stay with a single narrative of who they are that works in building legitimacy and belonging within the groups they want to associate with. Others develop the capacity to translate themselves from one context into another, with different narratives about who they are. Such translations can be perceived as dishonest by those who have never had to translate themselves into other contexts. However, this agonistic necessity of translation, of having multiple stories at the interface of different sensibilities in dissonance is something that is central to my life, since I was born, live, and work at this in-between space.

This constantly translated existence does not fit the frames of expectation of modern institutions. At the university, just as much as in writing this book, I have had to be extra-careful about what I disclose. There are several filters at work forcing me to read what I intend to express from many different angles and perspectives, trying to minimize the risks of exposure for myself and others, while considering who I can afford to upset and to what extent. As a strategy of institutional survival, I have had to learn how to read other people’s frames, desires, and responses, especially in relation to how I am read. Sometimes I observe nonracialized colleagues in university settings saying whatever comes to their minds without a worry about the implications. I always remain baffled by how people can take unfiltered self-expression for granted, and by how protected they are from the consequences of their words.

For example, I was once asked directly, by a white male colleague, how many people I had to sleep with to publish the number of articles and secure the research funding listed on my CV. What was most interesting was that, when my colleague asked this question, he was kind, genuinely curious, and not trying to offend me: he literally and honestly could not imagine how a young, brown woman could have done everything I did based on merit alone. Black and Indigenous male colleagues have also made inappropriate objectifying and infantilizing comments while trying to be nice and even protective. The fact that these men were not trying to be rude or offensive is also important because it reflects the systemic and subtle nature of racial, sexual, and age-related forms of violence that are normalized as part of modernity’s modes of relationship building.

The same subtlety can be observed in other questions I have received frequently, such as: How did someone like you become a professor? Aren’t you lucky to have a job in this institution? Why are you applying for grants again; have you not done enough? Why are you publishing so much? Aren’t you too ambitious, wanting to progress even more in your career? Shouldn’t you be spending more time looking after your children rather than pursuing a career? All these questions imply that I am perceived to aspire to more than what I deserve and what the system has allocated for me as a racialized woman. I have been told several times that my academic achievements are unfair: that my work is popular and I am invited to present it at conferences because of my racial identification rather than because of the merit of the work itself. Twice I was refused entry to buildings by security guards who thought I did not look the part for someone who should belong on university grounds. I recently received a note under my office door telling me to go back to the hellhole of the country that I came from.

In order to process the difficult teachings that my body has encountered, I have collaborated with artists and students to develop practices that attempt to visibilize the undercurrent of violence behind the politics and dynamics of inclusion within modernity. These collaborations point to the costs of being included in modern spaces and institutions.[^5]

One of these collaborations is the poem “Brutal Kindness.” This poem was collectively written by me and several of my students during a period of social and political turmoil in Finland in 2012. In this difficult period, immigrants were being scapegoated for the economic crisis of 2011. Finnish students in Helsinki were also marching against their classes being offered in English, as a way to oppose globalization and internationalization. There had been three racially motivated murders of Black immigrants in my neighborhood and the police refused to acknowledge the racial motivation behind these crimes. The poem speaks of my experience as the only racialized professor from the global south at my university; the experiences of my Black, Indigenous (Sámi), and other racialized immigrant students; and the incidents that happened in our town (Oulu).

Brutal Kindness

We welcome you to our nation

Our borders are only open to a few

We ask for nothing in return, except

That you recognize the deepest wisdom

That when in Rome you do as the Romans do

Therefore, you must

speak our language, admire our deeds, adopt our dreams

obey our laws, embrace our values, praise our intelligence

like our food, fulfill our expectations, mimic our behavior

contribute to our economy, aspire to be like us, commit to staying here

dedicate your life to our people and be thankful for our efforts to help you

We offer you unlimited hospitality

We chose you amongst countless others

We ask for nothing in return, except

That you acknowledge the ineptitude of your people

And the natural superiority of ours

Therefore, you must

know your place, do as you are told, strive for your best

work twice as hard, feel indebted, show good manners

be clean and organized, get an education

dress appropriately, smell nice, pay your duties

lay low, be happy, focus on positive things

use language that we can understand

entertain us with your culture, when requested

and jump off the balcony, if required

We give you access to the best welfare and education system

We expect you to show us that you truly deserved it

We ask for nothing in return, except

That you appreciate the privilege

Of being allowed amongst us

Therefore, under no circumstance,

should you break our trust, complain or communicate disapproval

expose our inadequacies, reveal our contradictions

disclose our insecurities, challenge our authority

make up accusations, fuel dissent

defy our right to distinguish our heroes

remind us of what we choose to deny

speak of the past we want to forget

outperform, outsmart, outshine us

or bite the hands that feed you

We will do everything in our power for you to properly fit in

We are certain you will learn to appreciate our benevolence

We expect nothing in return, except

That you salute our openness, altruism and sense of justice

And sacrifice your difference for the greater collective good

We will give you a secure future

in an incomparable country

We ask for nothing in return, except

For your compliance and submission

We have zero tolerance for the crime of ingratitude

Your choice not to conform to expectations

Or disregard for our traditions and protocols

Will bring upon yourself unimaginable consequences

As a public reminder of the faults of your character

The poem was published in a local newspaper in Finland under a pseudonym with an email account created for the publication. It attracted a large amount of hate email, including death threats.[^6] Around the same time, other colleagues in Finland were also receiving death threats for raising issues about race relations in the midst of a populist wave of anti-immigrant sentiments. It was common for my immigrant students and me to be stopped on the streets by local people and to be told to go home or to stop speaking a foreign language. In 2013, a group self-identified as “patriots” forced their entry into an event at the Jyväskylä city library that was held to launch an academic book on multiculturalism and the Finnish far-right movement. A man was stabbed. This was the point when I realized that my work could put my physical safety and the safety of my family at risk.

## Exercise

Check your bus. Observe your passengers’ responses to the poem. In what ways do your passengers relate to the pain of being subject to the racialized and gendered projections described in it? Can you identify passengers on your bus who reproduce these harmful projections? How do they feel when these are made visible? If you have identified passengers who are feeling defensive, what can you do to move these passengers on to more generative forms of engagement? Where are they coming from? What are they afraid of? What are the implications of holding onto their assumptions for their capacity to build relationships across cultures and contexts?

**_Towards Braiding_**

I moved to Canada in 2013, and in 2017 I started to work with Elwood Jimmy, who is an Indigenous arts curator at the Musagetes Foundation. Our ongoing collaboration focuses on the challenges and possibilities of encounters between Indigenous and settler communities in the arts sector. Following the completion of the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada in 2015, efforts to decolonize and Indigenize institutions have increased exponentially. However, these intensified efforts have also exposed some of the problems, complexities, and paradoxes of this work. In 2019 we published a book, coauthored with Sharon Stein, titled _Towards Braiding,_ reporting on some of our findings up to that point. The book focuses on the difficulties of bringing together different senses and sensibilities of communities in historical dissonance on uneven institutional grounds.

Our collaboration started when attempts to “include” Indigenous people and their knowledges in an organization failed, relationships fell apart, and extensive damage resulted. In our consultation process with Indigenous and non-Indigenous artists we found that this was a common story: an organization hires an Indigenous person expecting this person to decolonize and Indigenize without understanding the real costs of these processes to the person, and the challenges for the organization in general. The common institutional desire is for the formula: business as usual, plus nonthreatening Indigenous content, minus guilt and risk of bad press. The consultation process made clear both the harmful effects of this dynamic for Indigenous people and the need to make the formula and its effects visible for organizations. It also became clear that it was important to make this dynamic visible for Indigenous people, since many reported that when they faced these problems they found themselves without a language that could both express what was wrong and be legible to the settler-dominated institutions in which they were working. Thus, in this collaboration, our team started to pilot artistic and pedagogical experiments and exercises that could support Indigenous artists in articulating the problems they faced and that could support institutions in holding space for the difficult process entailed by gesturing toward decolonization.

One of these experiments was a creative social cartography mapping ten “Ds” of disillusionment with inclusion. If you are an Indigenous person contracted to decolonize or Indigenize while not interrupting business as usual, you are obviously set up to fail.

First, there will be the assumption of **d**eficit, which implies that giving you a job is doing you a favor: you are allowed in through the back door. Since you were hired to serve, there will be the expectations of **d**uty: to protect and support the colonial interests of those who have hired you. There will also be the institutional expectation that you agree to **d**isplay your diversity as a form of endorsement for the institutional brand (i.e., being happy to pose for the “equity” photo opportunity shared on social media). When these expectations are not met, the relationship may reach a tipping point where you will be reminded of your **d**ebt (for being “included”); you will face **d**istrust (in your skills and knowledge to perform your job); and your complaints will be met with **d**isdain (people will explain to you that you are not special and you should stop whining and get on with your job). When relationships reach a breaking point, you will be seen as the problem and you will probably be replaced by someone who is perceived as more capable of fulfilling the expectations you failed (or refused) to fulfill. You will face **d**iscipline, **d**elegitimization, and possible **d**ismissal. The organization will likely **d**eny that any harm has been inflicted upon you. If you are invested in the promise of inclusion, this systemic dynamic pattern of deficit, duty, display, debt, distrust, disdain, discipline, delegitimization, dismissal, and denial will cause you a great deal of grief and frustration.

Systemic violence is complex and multilayered. One thing that cuts across layers is the disproportionate amount of labor that Indigenous and other visibly racialized bodies bear when they are expected to teach other people about systemic colonial and racial violence in equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) initiatives. The exercise “Why I Can’t Hold Space for You Anymore,” another pedagogical experiment that emerged from our consultations in the _Towards Braiding_ project, presents an attempt to pedagogically address unconscious patterns of problematic behavior at work in EDI initiatives that are difficult to name and to interrupt.

The exercise consists of a poem and an invitation for self-examination. The poem lists the reasons why symbolic EDI statements and gestures are often costly for the well-being of Indigenous and other visibly racialized people who are expected to hold spaces for institutional learning about complicities in historical, systemic, and ongoing harm. In this exercise, we invite people to read the poem once and consider the different kinds of responses it evokes in them.

Do You Really Want to Know Why I Can’t Hold Space for You Anymore?

Because

You see my body as an extension of your entitlements

Because

I have held space for you before

and every time, the same thing happens

You take up all the space

and expect me to use my time, energy, and emotion

in service of fulfilling your desires:

to perform my trauma

to affirm your innocence

to celebrate your self-image

to center your feelings

to absolve you from guilt

to be always generous and generative

to filter what I say in order not to make you feel uncomfortable

to validate you as someone who is good and innocent

to be the appreciative audience for your self-expression

to provide the content of a transformative learning experience

to make you feel loved, important, special, and safe

and you don’t even realize you are doing it

and you don’t even realize you are doing it

AND YOU DON’T EVEN REALIZE YOU ARE DOING IT

Because your support is always conditional

On whether it aligns with your agenda

On whether it is requested in a gentle way

On whether I perform a politics that is convenient for you

On whether it fits your personal brand

On whether it contributes to your legacy

On whether you will get rewarded for doing it

On whether it feels good

Or makes you look good

Or gives you the sense that we are “moving forward”

Because when you “give” me space to speak

It comes with strings attached about

what I can and cannot say

and about how I can say it

You want an easy way out

A quick checklist or one-day workshop

on how to avoid being criticized

while you carry out business as usual

And even when I say what I want to say anyway

You can’t hear it

Or you listen selectively

And when you think you hear it

You consume it

You look for a way to say “that’s not me”

“I’m one of the good ones”

and use what I say to criticize someone else

Or you nod empathetically and emphatically to my face and then

The next thing you do shows that while you can repeat my words

Your perceived entitlements remain exactly the same

And when I put my foot down or show how deeply angry or frustrated I am

You read me as ungrateful, incompetent, unreliable, and betraying your confidence

You complain behind my back that I’m creating a hostile environment

You say I’m being unprofessional, emotional, oversensitive

That I need to get over it

That I’m blocking progress

That I shouldn’t be so angry

That I have a chip on my shoulder

That my ancestors lost the battle

That not everything is about colonialism or racism or whiteness

That aren’t we all just people, in the end?

That we are all Indigenous to some place

That you feel really connected to the earth, too

That you have an Indigenous friend/colleague/girlfriend that really likes you …

You minimize and further invisibilize my pain

Your learning

your self-actualization

your credibility

your security

and your social mobility

always come at my expense.

That is why I can’t hold space for you anymore.

## Exercise

Read the text again. Focus your attention on your amygdala, which is the part of the brain that stores information about emotional events and that manages situations of perceived threat. In modernity, our brain is trained to minimize threat and maximize reward in specific ways. If something is perceived as a threat to one’s self-image, status, autonomy, or security, the amygdala is triggered, prompting the responses of fight, flight, freeze, or fawn (i.e., to please). Identify the passengers on your bus engaged in the responses described in table 5, on the next page. Consider the fears, insecurities, and desires that could be behind these responses; and how these fears, insecurities, and desires could be unconsciously driving your actions and relationship building with Indigenous and visibly racialized persons and communities.

Pause to consider:

- the costs of these patterns in the long run both for the well-being of Indigenous and racialized people and for the depth and sustainability of the relationships you build;
- what you would need to unlearn to enable healthier and more generative relationships;
- how you might be expecting other people to hold space for your unlearning and to have patience with your inevitable mistakes, how this expectation places a demand on other people’s time and labor, and how it may require them to relive painful and traumatic experiences and frustrations for your sake; and
- how the labor expected of Indigenous and visibly racialized people could be better acknowledged, rewarded—and better yet, (re)distributed in your institutional context.

Another poem that emerged in the _Towards Braiding_ collaboration is titled “Wanna Be an Ally?” Like the previous poem, it identifies the problems with forms of allyship that centers modern desires and investments, but it also offers an invitation for solidarity otherwise.

Wanna Be an Ally?

wanna be an ally? don’t do it for charity, for feeling good, for looking good, or for showing others that you are doing good

don’t do it in exchange for redemption from guilt, for increasing your virtue, for appeasing your shame, for a vanity award

don’t put it on your CV, or on facebook, or in your thesis, don’t make it part of your brand, don’t use it for self-promotion

don’t do it as an excuse to keep your privileges, to justify your position, don’t use it as a currency to transcend your privilege without having to give anything up

do it only if you feel that our pasts, presents and futures are intertwined, and our bodies and spirits entangled

do it only if you sense that we are one metabolism that is sick, and what happens to me also happens to you

do it recognizing that you have the luxury of choice to participate or not, to stand or not, to give up your weekend or not, whereas others don’t get to decide

don’t try to “mold” me, or to “help” me, or to make me say and do what is convenient for you

don’t weaponize me (“I couldn’t possibly be racist if I am helping you”)

don’t instrumentalize me (“my marginalized friend says I am right”)

don’t speak for me (“I know what you really mean”)

don’t infantilize me (“I am doing this for you”)

don’t make your actions contingent on me confiding in you, telling you my traumas, recounting my traditions, practicing your idea of “right” politics, or performing the role of a victim to be saved by you or a revolutionary that can save you

and expect it to be, at times, incoherent, messy, uncomfortable, difficult, deceptive, contradictory, paradoxical, repetitive, frustrating, infuriating, boring and painful—and prepare for your heart to break open to be stretched

do you still want to do it?

then share the burdens placed on my back, the unique medicines you bring, and the benefits you have earned from this violent and lethal disease

co-create the space where I am able to do the work that only I can and need to do, for all of us

take a step back from the center, the frontline from visibility, relinquish the authority of your interpretations, your choice, your entitlements, relinquish that which you are most praised and rewarded for

don’t try to teach, to lead, to organize, to mentor, to control, to theorize, or to determine where we should go, how to get there and why

offer your energy to peel potatoes, to wash the dishes, to scrub the toilets, to drive the truck, to care for the babies, to separate the trash, to do the laundry, to feed the elders, to clean the mess, to buy the food, to fill the tank, to write the grant proposal, to pay the tab and the bail

to do and support things you can’t and won’t understand, and do what is needed, instead of what you want to do, without judgment, or a sense of martyrdom or expectation for gratitude, or for any kind of recognition

then you will be ready to sit with me through the storm

with the anger, the pain, the frustration, the losses, the fears,

and the longing for better times with each other

and you will be able to cry with me, to mourn with me, to laugh with me, to “heart” with me

as we face our shadows and find other joys in earthing, breathing, braiding, growing, cooking and eating, sharing, healing, and thriving side by side.

Beyond Representation, Recognition, and Redistribution

I was recently invited to join a virtual panel on global feminisms organized by a group of women at an Ivy League university in the United States. One of the questions I was asked was, “What will be the role of global feminisms in the decolonial futures you have imagined?” My response emphasized that it is impossible to imagine decolonial futures from where we stand, having our livelihoods underwritten and our unconscious mostly occupied by modernity/coloniality. However, I added that, if we still had to talk about global feminisms in a supposedly decolonized future, something would have definitely gone wrong. I said that, when I identify as a feminist, I see the point of my role as working myself out of the need for feminist critiques in the future, rather than indefinitely investing in a collective identity.

Within modernity, any form of politics in order to be legible must have a dialectical description of a problem (critique) and a prescription of solutions (proposition). I have the deepest respect for many of the critiques articulated within these political frames, for the collective pain where they come from, and for what they mobilize in terms of harm reduction. However, I am also deeply suspicious and skeptical of their propositions since, to be legible within modernity, they necessarily have to fit the format of exceptionalism, exaltedness, and claims of emancipation (as extensions of colonial entitlements) that reproduce modernity’s violence and unsustainability. This framing is unavoidable for political mobilizations that aspire to be intelligible within modernity.

The seemingly paradoxical position of deep respect and deep suspicion or deep skepticism is extremely important for hospicing modernity and I apply that to my own work as well, and especially as I am writing this book. I am often asked why I am not making connections with eco-Marxism(s), post-humanism(s), or Indigenous feminism(s) in my work and my response is the same: I have deep respect but deep skepticism toward anything that has critical traction within modernity. I also often mention that it would be important to interrogate the desires for universal and totalizing answers that might inform that question. And if people still feel these connections are needed, then they should by all means follow that call and do that work (rather than project this work on my time and on my body).

Imagining a political practice beyond representation, recognition, and redistribution is almost impossible within modernity. In this context, critiques of colonialism focus—at best—on the subjugation of peoples and the occupation of lands. An understanding of colonialism that starts with separability and the objectification of the earth as property is both largely illegible and unactionable within what is considered real, desirable, and possible. Thus, political mobilizations around representation, recognition, and redistribution have been and can be effective and productive if the aims are to gain access to institutions, social mobility, markets, and platforms for voice and power. However, while these strategies are important for harm reduction within modernity, as we approach the limits of the current system, this form of politics has five main limitations that may affect negatively the very people they aim to protect and to empower.

First, as has been described earlier in this chapter, diversity is an industry and a trade that depends on the goodwill and sense of benevolence of the dominant group. Modernity mobilizes diversity as a form of currency consumed by the dominant groups without a substantial commitment to changing the systemic conditions of suffering. The unwritten contract for inclusion is about supporting business as usual by increasing the number of diverse people invested in the same game, rather than in changing the game. In this context, marginalized people tend to expect much more from institutions (e.g., redress, retribution, repatriation) than what institutions are ready to give. In addition, if the diverse people engaged in this trade fail to meet institutional expectations, they experience the ten Ds of punishment and disillusionment described earlier.

Second, in times and contexts of perceived economic scarcity different marginalized communities are pitted against one another in a competition for a bigger platform and more resources. Very often, this can become a competition based on the perception of who the most deserving community/person is, and frequently this turns into a competition for the community/person who has suffered the most (what some call “oppression Olympics”). Modernity benefits enormously from these competitions (i.e., the divide and conquer approach)—much more than those who are compelled to compete.

Third, many marginalized groups tend to assume—relying on the presupposition that changes in thinking drive changes in relationships—that exposing the problem (calling things out) leads to change in personal and institutional behavior. However, although people may agree with these analyses of oppression, their unconscious affective structures depend on the continuity of the system as it is. We have plenty of evidence that critique often leads only to cosmetic rather than to substantive changes. This is because the problems are not merely cognitive—they involve affective, relational, and material economies that sustain the world as we know it and that can only fundamentally change when the limits of this world are reached and all easier options are exhausted.

Fourth, in the “plus one”/“minus one” moral economy, we tend to look for idealized role models of virtue that could have the vision and authority to lead us into a different future, rather than face the fallibility and complexity of humanity within all of us. Once we feel disenchanted with specific idealized role models, this economy forces us to look for idealized replacements. Thus, those who feel that role models from the dominant group have never been or are no longer considered virtuous or authoritative will tend to replace them with idealized role models of people victimized by oppression. The usual belief is that once you have suffered from oppression, you will have both a critique and proposition that can end all forms of oppression. Unfortunately, this form of replacement reproduces the same economy and idealization that romanticizes humanity. In this context, we tend to homogenize and romanticize marginalized communities, denying them the complexity and fallibility that characterize the full spectrum of humanity; and turning them into characters in order to affirm our fantasies of solidarity, redemption, futurity, and continuity. These fantasies can work up to a point, as long as individuals and communities acquiesce to play along. However, when there is dissent, resistance, or individuals fail to live up to our projections; relationships and idealizations fall apart, often with detrimental implications for marginalized individuals and communities.

Fifth, as we see structures in the dominant system starting to fail (e.g., unrealistic promises of endless prosperity), many people in the dominant group will feel resentful and insecure. This will prompt them to look for scapegoats, easy solutions, and leaders who promise to fix the perceived chaos and return things to the “normal” order. Those who will see the promises of the system as broken have the potential to turn violent in their effort to protect their “plus one” place in the hierarchical order of society. In this context, those fighting for representation, recognition, and redistribution become easy targets for aggression because they will be perceived as being responsible for the moral and financial disorder, and as undeserving competitors in the narrowing ladder for economic survival.

Taking all this into consideration, while equity, diversity, and inclusion within modernity can be important in the short term, neither inclusion nor representation is a viable response in the long run: modern institutions or capitalism led by Black, Indigenous, or people of color cannot be the endgame because this would still reproduce the harms necessary for sustaining modernity. The dynamics of oppression within modernity are layered, complex, and happen at multiple levels (e.g., both consciously and unconsciously). In order to expand modernity (to include more people) or replace hierarchies within it (change who is at the top), other marginalized people and the environment will have to pay the price. Even when we take intersectional oppression into account intellectually, we may not be able to interrupt the oppression that happens in intra- and interpersonal (affective and relational) layers or the material economies of exploitation and expropriation that sustain modernity in the systemic layers.

Two caveats are important here. One, at the same time that we attend to these limitations, it is crucial to recognize and be accountable to the fact that, in the current volatile context, the critique presented here can be weaponized against marginalized people seeking representation, recognition, and redistribution. While I am proposing a different educational pathway, at the same time I support and often lead efforts and initiatives that promote equity, diversity, and inclusion as a form of harm reduction—particularly initiatives that can hold space for the anger, frustration, and burnout that are part and parcel of the struggle of marginalized groups to survive within the current system.[^7] Two, as the heat and complexity of discussions intensify about decolonization, abolitionism, and Indigenization—especially around questions of tokenism and appropriation—clashes of agendas can become toxic and nongenerative. While it is important to seek better relations, articulations, and containers to hold these discussions, it is also important to recognize that these clashes are pushing significant boundaries and generating the sense of urgency for difficult conversations to happen.

If we want to hold space for difficult and painful conversations without relationships falling apart, we will need to consider practices that can support us in getting to zero. This entails a political practice of composting and decluttering that can help us to disinvest from harm, interrupt modern addictions, and transition out of the violence and unsustainability of a dying modernity. This involves the position of deep respect and deep skepticism mentioned above, where we are grateful for the risky and precarious work of critics in exposing harm, while disinvesting from propositions that reproduce modernity’s violence. We need to start from the assumption that no one has the answers to our current predicament, that we cannot _not_ be together,[^8] and that each one of us is insufficient and indispensable to what needs to be done. We need a political practice of healing and well-being where the call for maturity, sobriety, discernment, and accountability is for everyone; where no one is ever off the hook.

  

# 7  
Living and Dying Well

In the process of writing this book, I woke up in the middle of the night to find my partner lying cold by my side. I tried to shake him awake, without success. The next five seconds lasted an eternity as an avalanche of emotions overtook me and immobilized my body. I remember that the strongest feeling was, surprisingly, anger: “How dare you die on me?” Then I managed to scream. He woke up and told me very gently that he was not dead, which obviously came as a great relief. However, the adrenaline rush prevented me from going back to sleep. I kept thinking that both our days were numbered, and on another layer of existence beyond linear time and form, we did not exist in these bodies. The next day we had the first Zoom session of a series called “The End of the World as We Know It” that I had organized through my university. Indigenous people from our network, both in the north and the south, had offered to hold a ceremony during the Zoom sessions. Mortality at many different layers was close by that day and, from then on, I decided to keep it closer.

Modernity intends to defeat death and, by setting this intention, it harnesses our fears of death. The fear of mortality (for our bodies, our loved ones, or our species) keeps us seeking projections where we postpone living fully until the ideal _something_ comes along: the ideal partner, ideal job, ideal time, ideal self-image, ideal place.… But if you know your days are numbered—and they are—you can’t wait for the ideal anything. The ideal day is today: today is as good a day to die as any other day, as the Indigenous saying goes. Once this realization sinks in, there is a chance we may start to notice the multiple deaths that happen within and around us every day so that we can remain alive, and to be grateful for each extra day we have before finally exiting the body. Living well is inseparable from dying well and these two things are happening at the same time. So, I held my partner and our mortalities close that night and said that I was not going to hold back on living and loving fully, even if that involved loss, grief, betrayal, and pain. I felt grateful to have him by my side—his whole bus, the whole shebang—for as long as it lasted.

You may have heard of the term _buen vivir,_ or “living well.” The term is often evoked to emphasize a distinction between “living well” and “living better.” “Living better” is commonly promoted in modernity’s ladder of social mobility and feeds the perceived need to constantly aspire to have more than one has and more than one’s neighbors. In contrast, the term “living well” _(buen vivir)_ is often understood to be an Andean philosophy that challenges “living better” by emphasizing the centrality of “having enough” in order to sustain reciprocal relations between all living beings. However, _buen vivir_ is partly an attempted translation of the Quechua term _sumac kawsay,_ which is not only an intellectual concept but also a way of being in the world. Quechua educator Maria Jara Qquerar emphasizes that, in the lived practice of _sumac kawsay,_ “dying well” is just as important as “living well,” as they are in fact part of the same cycle. Yet in Western societies, death and dying are generally understood as events to be feared and avoided.

Death doulas working in Western societies, who provide end-of-life support services for people in palliative care, face a recurrent problem. In a situation when someone receives a terminal diagnosis and a relative suggests contacting a death doula, there is usually resistance from some family members, sometimes aggressive resistance, to the suggestion. The relative who makes the suggestion is often perceived to be welcoming death by proposing that the family should accept death, rather than fight for a miracle that can save the diagnosed person’s life. When the event of death finally occurs, sometimes the relative is blamed for death’s arrival, as if by talking about death and dying or by preparing for death we necessarily speed up the process. This makes sense within modernity, since modernity emerged as an attempt to control change and resist and defeat death, which is done partly by dissociating ourselves from nature (as if we were not part of it).

Talking within modernity about the potential or likelihood of the collapse of modernity follows the same pattern. People generally avoid this topic or deny its relevance in order to maintain a sense of hope in the futurity and continuity of the existing system. Many assume that, once people accept the likelihood of collapse, they will stop fighting for change or indulge in fatalistic behavior since there is no utility-maximizing or teleological motivation to act. Accepting the potential or likelihood of social and ecological collapse, in this case, is equated with speeding it up.

However, many non-Western cultures, including many Indigenous cultures, do not approach death, dying, or the potential or likelihood of collapse in this way. Societies that see death and life as integral to each other have processes and protocols of coordination and preparedness to deal with the inevitability of change, pain, loss, and death that are unimaginable within modernity. Indigenous people may often also be better equipped to work with and through complexities and paradoxes. Cree scholar Cash Ahenakew, for example, argues that Indigenous people face a fundamental paradox of having to survive within violent and unsustainable modern/colonial systems that infantilize humanity; while at the same time keeping alive the responsibility to maintain older and more mature Indigenous modes of existence. He says that the life pathways modernity offers are extremely limited in terms of preparing people for dealing with life’s vicissitudes and human responsibilities on a finite planet. Conversely, most Indigenous peoples have richer stories that prepare everyone for the challenges and accountabilities of multiple stages of life, as the story told in the next section illustrates.

## Exercise

Pause. What emotional imprints of death and dying have you inherited from your family or cultural context(s)? Were death and dying topics of conversation as you grew up or were they avoided? What would be your greatest worry if you knew you were to die tomorrow? Check your bus. Who are the passengers on your bus who are afraid of death and dying? Why are they afraid? Who are the passengers afraid of loss and grief? How can you invite them to consider mortality in more generative ways? Many cultures believe that without bringing our own mortality closer to our everyday living, we cannot really live well because we will be living a projection of a life rather than existing in the present and being grateful for every day that we are granted and for those who sacrifice themselves to keep us alive. For some cultures, it is common to hear that from the day we are born, we are also dying. A useful insight is that we have a limited number of breaths as we are born. Each of these breaths is sacred. Take ten breaths, honoring each of them as sacred. How do you intend to honor the breaths you have left and those who sacrifice themselves to keep you alive? To whom would you be grateful for the opportunity of sharing your remaining breaths? What would you like your remaining breaths to move in the planet-metabolism you are part of?

A Life-Path Cree Story

This is a version of a story originally told to me in 2015 by a Cree elder named John Crier. The story is about four mountains representing four stages of life. The story became very important in a research project that I was also part of, led by another Cree knowledge keeper, Cash Ahenakew. Cash’s project showed examples of how Indigenous education is fundamentally about preparing people, from the day they are born, to become good elders and ancestors for all relations. John has kindly and generously given us permission to travel with this story and to write down this version of it.

Before I start, I need to remind you that, in Indigenous storytelling, stories are living entities that can land in our hearts if we let them, and dance with us. This dance can be short or long. It can also last a whole lifetime. In this dance, different layers of meaning and sense-fullness are revealed gradually and slowly, sometimes over decades. The insights depend on the available space we have inside us. If there is too much clutter, then that can leave insufficient space for stories to move, to dance, and to reveal new insights. We often need to clear the space before the stories can land.

Some Indigenous stories carry sacred knowledge that can only be revealed to specific Indigenous people. These stories need to be protected within the communities they reside in. As an Indigenous elder, John carries many stories like that. Other stories, like this one, are meant to go to places and dance with more people. Some stories want to travel, in order to see the world and be transformed by it. This particular story turned out to be a traveling story. With John’s permission, it traveled to different Indigenous communities internationally and danced with many peoples and places. When this particular version of the story came back to the part of Turtle Island (Canada) where it came from, it had learned different dance moves from the peoples it had met and the places it had been.

With traveling stories, it is very difficult to tell the difference between what was there before it began traveling and what is new. Rather than trying to find the original dance, I just had to allow the story to come to me one day, after a fast. Then I asked John to correct what I may have misinterpreted. Written stories traveling on paper have a different rhythm and dance from the stories that travel through voice and are told in a way chosen specifically for the person who is listening. Therefore, if you have a chance, I encourage you to listen to this story from John Crier himself, while he is still around. He will be happy to hear from you. I will tell you the version of the traveling story that showed itself in our collaboration.

The Four Mountains

This is a story about four mountains. Each mountain represents a stage of life that human beings need to go through. There is a baby mountain, a warrior mountain, a hunter/provider mountain, and an elder mountain. If all is in balance, the land, the ancestors, all relations will support the human people to move from one mountain to the other. Humans, like other beings, do not own their time or their life. It is a more powerful force, which many Indigenous people call the Great Spirit or the Creator, who decides the length of time we will travel through life and the visions we will receive for what and how we are meant to contribute. Some people are meant to travel only so far through the mountains—they may complete their journey early for different reasons. Sometimes, with babies, for example, the time is not right for them to stay, but they still come to visit their families for a bit, as a gift. Sometimes people get lost or find a path in the mountains that leads to a dead end, and sometimes they starve there. Sometimes people, individually or collectively, just get stuck in one mountain without the teachings they need to proceed. When this happens, the guidance of elders is necessary to help people to find the path, connect to the visions, and move in a healthier way again.

### The Baby Mountain

The first mountain is the baby mountain. If everything is in balance, when you come into the world as a baby, you are received at the base of this mountain with unconditional regard and respect for your existence, in the arms of your parents, your elders, and your communities who are committed to your well-being. Your first rite of passage is your first breath. You are carried up this mountain in a bundle that strengthens the connection between your baby body and the collective bodies around you, of your extended family. Wise and healthy grandparents, great-uncles, and great-aunties have a huge role to play in this mountain; and when they are not there, sometimes babies cannot make it to the other side. Once you reach the top of this mountain, you start to take your first steps on your own on your way down, still held by the hand of older relations. The focus of your learning shifts to your feet on the land. You learn about how to feel and relate to the ground beneath your feet and how to thread your path carefully, with respect and reverence for the land that will hold you for the rest of the journey. Learning that you are part of creation and cared for and guided by the people, the land, the ancestors, and all relations, makes you feel in your bones that your life has intrinsic value.

### The Warrior Mountain

The second mountain is the warrior mountain. Now that you can walk on your own, the rite of passage in this mountain is to learn to set your own boundaries and to encounter your own vision and place in the world, rather than have your parents or other people define it for you. This is the mountain where you find your unique gifts, the unique medicines you bring and that eventually you will learn to put to use as they are needed. When society is in turmoil, it is the young people starting to climb this mountain who feel the consequences the most because they have not yet established boundaries, they have unbound energy and, since they are seeking and learning about self-rule, they also tend to push back against guidance and advice. As young people look for their path on their own, they sometimes end up on the wrong path when guidance is not available.

On this mountain you also need to meet and wrestle with your shadows. On the way up, it is like going into a very thick forest in the dark, in the middle of the night, with the half-moon and the stars barely illuminating the way. The trees can see your spirit, they know who you are, but they can’t tell you anything directly—you are still too self-absorbed to listen. They need to shake you out of this self-absorption to communicate with you. As you climb up, you grow impatient. It feels as if you can only be well if you find the answers, if you have certainty. But the role of the land as your teacher is to introduce you to the mystery of your existence. It can give you directions, usually in the form of visions and songs, but it won’t give you the final answer for everything you seek at this point. The land will always give you what you need to take the next small step, do the next right thing, and keep moving in a healthy way as your learning and your story gradually unfold. This part of the mountain path can be frustrating because your body has energy to run, but the ground is uneven, requiring you to walk slowly in order to develop patience.

Those going up this mountain often spend a lot of time fighting with the shadows of the trees. There are also many distractions along the way: different pathway options, different voices and choices pointing in different directions. It is like trying to find your medicine, your gift, as a needle in a haystack. Many fears and insecurities show up in this process. Fear of not being worthy. Fear of not finding the “right” answer. Fear of missing out. Fear of humiliation, rejection, and abandonment. Fear of loss, pain, and death. Fear of making wrong choices. Fear that life may not be worth living. Fear that your life is a mistake. Fear of ineptitude and inadequacy. In order to forget these fears, many young people build an image of themselves that prevents others from seeing what is really going on. Some young people focus on building an image where they are strong, invincible, and never wrong. Others want to be seen as friendly, caring, and reliable. Some want to be seen as rebellious, transgressive, and defiant. Some are a mixture of all these types. But an image is just an image and the larger the gap between how you want to be seen (and also how you want the world to be) and the many things that are actually going on within you and around you, the harder the path feels for you and the higher the chances for making poor choices. This part of the mountain path is treacherous because you could be just living in your own bubble, walking in circles without direction, for the longest time. It is the job of families and of elders to support you and guide you, but sometimes they cannot show up because they are lost themselves and it could be that they got lost in the same mountain and never had an opportunity to find the path again. Especially nowadays, many people get trapped on this mountain and we lose too many of them.

Right around the corner from that difficult part of the path there is a clearing, but you can only see it when you are already exhausted from fighting with your shadows and the shadows of the trees. In this clearing you can rest, you can fast, you can breathe, you can observe, you can hear your heartbeat synchronize with the heartbeat of the earth when you calm down. If you manage to quiet your spirit and become humble before the land, you may be contacted by the spirits who have known and observed you; the spirits who know what you need, the next step you must take, and the seedlings of the gifts and medicines you have inside you. From that point of contact onward, your medicines start to grow and to work through you and at least half of the fears and insecurities disappear. On the way down this mountain, you develop familiarity and closeness with your gifts and your medicines, you learn as much as possible about them, and this feels really good in a surprising way. This good feeling is generally different than you might have been expecting or looking for on your way up this mountain.

### The Hunter/Provider Mountain

The third mountain is the hunter or provider mountain. The rite of passage of this mountain is about seeing a much bigger picture and about seeing more than the picture is showing you as well, into the past and into the future. It is also about learning to use your medicines and gifts to contribute toward the well-being of your family, of your community, of the land, and of all relations. Now that you have learned to establish boundaries and you are starting to trust your own gifts, you need to learn how to offer them in a generative way to your community. You need to learn when, how, and how much to offer; when your medicines are good medicines, and when they can turn into poison; and how to integrate them with other medicines and gifts of other relations. This looks simple, but it is actually a period full of challenges. You will make many mistakes before you learn to work well with your own medicines and gifts and before you learn to integrate them with the medicines and gifts of others. This is a very busy and humbling period of deep learning about discernment. For example, some people may notice that you have good medicine, they may come to you to ask for or sometimes to demand some, but what you have may not be the medicine they need and you will need to know how to respond in this situation.

On this mountain you are learning to be both confident and humble, both autonomous and accountable, to be generous and to not allow your generosity to be exploited, to take things seriously and to laugh at yourself, to learn quickly from your mistakes and only make new mistakes as you move to the next learning, to apologize for the suffering you have caused, to not increase other people’s labor unnecessarily, and to be accountable to the human and nonhuman lives that sacrifice themselves to keep you alive. You learn to gift your gifts—a gift is only a gift when it is gifted. It cannot be sold. A gifted gift moves the heart of those who receive it to a place of reciprocity, but the reciprocity may not be directly back to you. You learn to trust that, as long as you are gifting your gifts and using your medicines in a generative way, the land and the spirits will take care of your needs too. Sometimes you need a day job to sustain your family while you do the work with your gifts and medicines in parallel. It is important to have a clear idea of the difference between what is the job and what is the work that needs to be done.

There are also shadows on this mountain that you need to wrestle with. You may be tempted to use your gifts in destructive ways. You need to observe yourself and what is happening around you. If there is imbalance, you can turn from a hunter into a predator who takes more than their fair share from the land and who exploits the weaknesses of other beings, taking advantage of them. This happens when there are gaps in the teachings of the previous mountains. That is why it is important that you learn very early what it means to be a helper; to put your body, your gifts, and your intellect to the service of the greater good of the land and the community. Otherwise you can use your life-force to destroy relations and to destroy yourself. When these imbalances happen, there is a natural law that makes you pay the price, sometimes with your life. Be really careful there.

Once you can apply the teachings of this mountain within your own community, you are ready to learn to integrate your medicines and gifts into a much wider ecology, on the way down from the hunter/provider mountain. This is where you may be ready to mentor others who have similar medicines and gifts to your own, so that they don’t have to repeat the mistakes you have made yourself. As you see your medicines/gifts from a different perspective, you really notice how large the world is, how small you are, and instead of feeling insignificant, you feel the opposite because you see the miracle and beauty of small things—including yourself. You realize how much you don’t know; and how much you can’t know. It is all a mystery, but you are no longer afraid of not having the answers. Shadows no longer scare you and pain no longer haunts you—you have learned to hold the hand of pain and to accept that shadows are everywhere where there is also light. You can see the beautiful and the ugly, the good and the bad, the broken and the messed up, and bear witness. You develop more reverence for the land, for the planet, that holds it all together.

You start to hear the songs that move everything: the seasons, waters, winds, clouds, plants, ourselves, other animals; the cycles of life, death, and renewal. You notice the rhythms and movements that transform everything around you. The sky and the stars speak with you differently. You experience time differently. Although you have already been told that everything is interconnected and you have seen glimpses of it, this time it is not just a glimpse—you cannot turn it off. You are ready for the elder mountain, but you will say that you don’t feel ready for that yet (which could be one of the signs that you are).

### The Elder Mountain

The fourth mountain, the elder mountain, is located behind the first three mountains described so far. The rite of passage here is to help other people with their rites of passage; to develop further your hindsight, insight, and foresight; and to become a good guide that can help people find their own direction according to the purpose of the mountain they are on. You will also revisit different teachings you received in your life and these teachings will show you deeper lessons. Since there is no book with an encyclopedia of directions you can give to those who need help, you will need to learn to support people who need your help by meeting them where they are at. In order to reach the elder mountain, which is near the baby mountain, you will need to go around all three mountains and visit the places where you shifted from one mountain to the next. There you will encounter people who need your guidance to find the path where they change to a different mountain. You will pass down your own experience of climbing, especially what you have learned from the mistakes you have made as you were finding your own direction. Like the trees in the warrior mountain, you cannot tell people directly what their purpose or direction should be. This is between them and the Great Spirit and they need to find it for themselves through their connection with the land and with all relations. This is important; otherwise they will not have the energy or the confidence to keep moving. As an elder, you will have to collaborate with the land and create experiences where the land itself can teach, and where you are just holding and protecting the space for those teachings.

As you walk to the elder mountain, you will meet warriors who are ready to become hunters/providers, you will meet children who are ready to become warriors, and you will meet some people who are stuck. Simultaneously, you will arrive at the place where the baby mountain meets the elder mountain. In the baby mountain you will help welcome new life to your community and help carry this life to the top of the first mountain. Elders are particularly suited to carry the babies because, unlike the warriors, they have patience; and unlike the hunters/providers, they have time. Both babies and elders are close to the ancestors and of the source of life-beyond-form. Elders also have the wisdom of hindsight to protect the babies, avoiding the parts of the path that are dangerous for the young ones.

On this mountain, no one reaches the top still carrying their body. Only your spirit reaches the top. At some point along this mountain’s path you will have to shed your body. When the day of shedding the body comes, you are ready to pass away to the place of the ancestors. You are grateful for what you have been taught in this body; you have settled what needed to be settled; you have prepared your family; you have passed down your stories and your songs; the people you have mentored have become mentors themselves; you have helped people to switch mountains; and you are at peace with the enormity, timelessness, and incessant movement of the land. You go with empty hands. You leave everything behind. You leave no footprints. You become an ancestor and you meet those who have come before, those who are yet to come, and all the invisible relations—both human and nonhuman—who accompanied you in your path on all four mountains. When you shed your body, you integrate all the experiences you have had in this life and your spirit becomes one with the mystery of creation.

## Exercise

To what extent has your formal education prepared you for healthy eldership of all relations? To what extent has your formal education contributed to self-infantilization? How many role models of healthy eldership—people who do not turn their back on responsibility and accountability—have you been exposed to in your life? What have they taught that really stayed with you? In what ways did they show you they were also flawed human beings? Which mountain were you at when you met them? How did you see these elders at the time? How do you see them now? Check your bus. Is there anyone dying? What mountain would these passengers be on? What do they need right now?

Traveling Reflections

As the story of the four mountains danced and traveled with me, I observed interesting responses to it, especially as I shared the story with Indigenous groups. In a community in Michoacán, Mexico, the story opened up a tense and lively conversation where youth and elders talked about how Indigenous identities have become commodities to be displayed on Facebook profiles versus how people were expected to show up in their communities with humility and without the sense of self-importance fed by social media. The conversation then moved to music and how different song styles can move people from one mountain to the next, and also get people stuck on specific mountains. With a Maori family in Otautahi/Christchurch, Aotearoa/New Zealand, the story of the four mountains started a conversation about the protocols for sharing trauma: the fact that unprocessed trauma should only be shared with those in the next mountain, who may know how to process them. Sharing unprocessed trauma with those in previous mountains is like spreading trauma around. In many conversations in Brazil and Peru the focus was on how the mountain story is neverending because it is part of a time/space spiral where we have been elders before, and we will come back again and again to learn different things. In one community, this story was told alongside an Oromo story from Ethiopia, which talks about eldership not being about age, but about white hair. In this story, there are three different kinds of elders: elders with white hair on their head who have been through a lot; elders with white hair on their feet, who have walked and seen a lot; and elders with grey hair in their heart, who may have been born like that.

Put alongside the story of the four mountains, modernity is a project of eternal youth, of a society that only goes as far as the warrior mountain in order to maintain its individualistic character. In a society that elevates, sensualizes, and fetishizes youth, the lessons of aging and of relational maturity are not valued as they are valued in other cultures. In modernity’s project, perhaps the only respected eldership is associated with the accumulation of wealth in the form of financial or credential assets that can be recognized and exchanged within modernity’s economies. You are supposed to respect those who have accumulated the most money or badges of honor and who should enjoy their entitlements and achievements uninterrupted in old-young retirement age. This modern story contributes to the trope of the warrior as a hero who conquers (the land/obstacles/enemies) and deserves unrestricted autonomy. The hero is protected, and sometimes immune, from the consequences of the violence and unsustainability required for modern existence. This is one of the stories we need to compost if we want to grow up and show up differently for one another and for the planet as a whole.

## Exercise, continued

Take a break. Go for a walk. As you walk toward your destination, imagine you are walking into the past, into the lessons learned by all your passengers as they reached their current mountains. Try to map the events that could have represented rites of passage. On your way back, think about the next mountains for your passengers. What is exciting, challenging, or scary about the path ahead?

# 8  
Returning Home

Vitalina, my grandmother on the Indigenous side of the family, died when I was eight years old. In the year she passed away, I remember her and my mum arguing a lot because she refused to live with us in the city. She left us a few stories, including the prediction that the house of modernity would not last long. After she died, it would be years before I reconnected with her side of the family and started working with Indigenous peoples in Latin America and across the world. It was a car accident that turned me toward Indigenous worldviews as a compass of survival. This accident marked an important rite of passage, an initiation. The description of this accident and what followed years later is important as a teaching story because stories of rites of passage and initiation are very rare within modernity.[^1]

We can think about rites of passage as involving three elements.[^2] They usually start with an interruption or severance that makes it impossible for the familiar way of being to continue as usual: you are stripped naked so that you can shed your old skin. Then there is the element of the “liminal,” a threshold where you are really vulnerable, but allows no going back and no other option except to be taught by the dis-eases, monsters, shadows, and shit—without guarantees that you will come out alive. The liminal is a space of great danger: where the work gets done at a cellular level in the flesh and in the bones, or where you die. The last element is the long return home, the growing of new skin, which involves a voluntary relinquishment of something previously deemed foundational, but that is no longer useful or necessary. You begin to integrate the unique lessons you have learned and you finally find your way back—and soon enough you start a new cycle.

Within modernity, these kinds of rites of passage are rare. Modernity encourages us to over-code the world to control it or to withdraw from it if we can’t[^3]—there is no incentive to encounter the world on its terms with both the pain and the joy that this entails, which is what genuine rites of passage require. This lack of incentive to face the world, along with a lack of preparedness to feel and not run away from difficult and painful things, contributes to a self-infantilizing pattern where we are conditioned to always seek more choices and entitlements, while firmly holding on to a safety blanket. Thus, as we seek unrestricted autonomy, we demand to be coddled and protected from the pain of the world and the consequences of our behaviors, choices, and actions. As consumers of brands, lifestyles, identities, knowledges, and visions, we have been trained to think about change as we think about clothes. We may shop for something new or used, preferably better fitting, more fashionable, and easier to wash, that will make us feel happier and look great on social media. We are even prepared to stage a dramatic break with what is familiar, which can resemble a severance, but the depth of the cut remains a matter of choice. The rites of passage I am talking about cannot happen on our terms.

This specific story shows that these rites of passage can also last several decades. When you zoom out into the bigger picture and wider timeline of existence, you can see how events and teachings are connected, because reality is layered. You realize that the different stages of your life—the paths in the different mountains in the story of the four mountains—exist simultaneously, neither consecutively nor linearly. What follows is the story of a long rite of passage that happened in spells and spirals, and where the long return home is not a point of arrival, but a difficult call for integration.

I did not take the decision lightly to tell you this intimate story. My family and I were concerned about how this story could be consumed. I invite you to treat this story as a gift—with the pain it entailed and the respect and reciprocity it deserves. I will need to describe the accident with some graphic detail; therefore, reader discretion is advised.

Severance: The Accident

I was twenty-one and my son was about to turn four. I had just gotten a driver’s license and bought a cheap old car on credit (a white 1982 Volkswagen Voyage). I was leaving my house just before five in the morning to swim at a community pool. It was dark, and would be at least an hour before the sun came up. I felt disgusted by my body, especially with the changes that resulted from having a child at sixteen. I desperately wanted to lose weight. With an extra-full teaching schedule and evening classes at the university, this was the only time left for me to exercise. I was only a block away from the house, headed up a hill, when I saw a blue pickup truck coming downhill fast, on my side of the road. The person could have been drunk. I panicked and swerved to the right, hoping to stop the car. But instead of hitting the brakes, I slammed down hard on the accelerator. I hit a large tree and totaled the car. I saw the blue pickup stop. A man got out of the car. He came to my car and looked in through the window. He then turned and went back to his car and left. He did not help. He did not call for help. I observed this from outside of the car, while my body was still inside the car. I watched the pickup truck drive away and felt an immense sadness for myself in that car, and, curiously, for that man as well.

The next thing I remember is being inside the car, the sun starting to come up. I knew there had been an accident. I could not feel my legs or my front teeth. The best way to describe it is to say that I felt nothing. I concluded that I was either dying or already dead. I convinced myself that if I was still dying, I wanted to die with dignity, and that meant I would not despair, I would not scream for help. As I watched the sun come up, I sensed a calming presence on the passenger’s side. I closed my eyes and I felt a hand touching my right hand, but mine was the only physical body in the car. Convinced that my passing was going to be peaceful, I was kind of ready to go. The sun was up. I thought it must have been around 6 a.m. Then someone from outside knocked on my left side window. To my surprise, I managed to roll it down. I realized I was not dead yet, although I couldn’t feel anything. A woman in pajamas started speaking to me. She told me she had called an ambulance and wanted to know if I wanted her to call someone else. As I opened my mouth to say something, a gush of blood came out of it. She fainted immediately and fell by the left door. A few minutes later her daughter came to the rescue.

I was pinned to the front panel with open fractures in my right leg. The impact of my face on the steering wheel had broken my jaw and knocked out several teeth. The combined efforts of the medical crew of first responders and the firemen brought to the scene to get me out of the car lasted three hours. The medical crew were not concerned about the open fractures; they were worried about something else. They told me they could tell that my right femur had come out of the hip socket. I heard them saying to each other that an artery in the leg just behind the hip socket may have been ruptured and this could be lethal. They wanted to take me to the hospital as quickly as possible. The impact had compacted the car to a point where they literally had to cut the car in half, in order to get my leg unpinned and the rest of my body out. “Get ready, it is going to hurt!” they said. The pain that I felt when they released the leg was indescribable, but it was also a sign that I could still feel everything. As I screamed at the top of my lungs, I was also happy to welcome the pain. My father had arrived with the firemen and was following the process closely. As I was being carried out of the car on a stretcher, he held my head and asked me to stay alive. We had been having a very difficult time in our relationship and the experience of being close to death changed how we felt about each other in profound ways. I was taken to the local hospital in great pain.

The public hospital was underfunded and understaffed. They did not have enough beds in the ER or the equipment they needed in the hospital to get my femur back into the socket. I was told they were requesting the equipment from another hospital. They could not admit me because, if they could not get the equipment, I would have to be transferred to a different hospital and, because of some bureaucratic rules, I had to wait until the equipment (or lack thereof) was sorted. Since I was bleeding a lot, they had put me on a narrow metal table with wheels (no mattress, no sheets) and rushed me to a rear ward.

I waited eight hours before they finally admitted me. I was extremely lucky that my femur missed the artery by less than one millimeter; otherwise I would have bled internally to death waiting for the equipment. I was still losing a lot of blood because of the other open fractures, but since I was not admitted, they could not offer any pain relief or treatment. They could not give me water either because they knew I could go into surgery at any minute. I could not move much, let alone get up or go to the toilet; I had to lie bleeding on that table for the next eight hours. There were many other people in the ward, some screaming in pain.

Once in a while a cleaning lady would come to my table with a mop to collect the mess on the floor under the table, but she would not touch the overflowing puddle of blood (and now urine) around my body on that table. She wouldn’t look at me, say anything, or show any feelings. I wondered how much she had to numb herself to work in that environment, and I felt really sorry for her. The pain was acute at all times, but there were also waves where it intensified. In one of these waves I felt my consciousness starting to fade—sight and sound become blurry and I knew at that point that I needed to keep myself awake. I decided to sing. Not loudly, but not quietly either. I thought that I needed to hear myself sing to keep myself awake. A young ER doctor approached the table. I thought he was going to say something nice at first and then I realized that he was annoyed by my singing. He told me to shut up. I felt a flood of tears in my eyes and realized I had not cried yet. I stopped the singing, but not entirely. I was screaming the song in my head and I promised myself that no one would ever be able to stop me from singing, even if no sound came out of my mouth. By the way, the song was a nursery rhyme with no meaningful content—it was not about the form of the song, or the meaning of words, but what that sound was moving in me.

At that point, something really important clicked in my being. It was something about the gap between how I felt, how others perceived me, and where my needs were met. It was not that I stopped caring about my impact on other people; it was not indifference, vindictiveness, or numbing—quite the opposite actually. It was more to do with realizing that I could not expect that other people, like that doctor, or the cleaning lady, could “ground” me. I needed to do that myself and I did not require an audience for that to happen. It was about both establishing a boundary between the world within me and what was happening around me—especially in a dangerous situation—and about finding in this internal world an anchor, a source of vitality, that did not depend on external forces to function. Part of me still wanted empathy, sympathy, and even pity. Part of me wanted at least the physical pain to go away. But this became less and less important as that other source of vitality took over and got me focused on keeping myself alive. The accident that almost killed me offered me the teachings that saved my life—and not only on that day.

When the equipment eventually arrived, I was admitted and went straight into a series of multiple surgeries. I was lucky to have had a wonderful trauma surgeon who was not only excellent at the type of surgery I needed, but who was also furious at the negligence that occurred in the waiting room. He said it was a miracle that I was alive after losing the amount of blood that I had lost. The hospital’s blood bank asked my family to find thirty-six blood donors (18 liters) to restock what I had used. Recovery was long and difficult, but eventually I could swim, walk, and dance again. Since a lot of cartilage was lost and screws and wires were implanted to keep myself glued together, I have to manage some chronic pain as a result. But in comparison to what I faced on that metal ER table, this is not a big deal at all.

Threshold: Depression

Three years had passed since the accident; I was twenty-four and had just had another baby. I had postpartum depression. The image of the man in the blue pickup truck leaving the scene of the accident without offering assistance often played in my mind. I felt betrayed and angry, but not at him. I was angry that he was not able to offer help. I was angry that we had arrived at a point in our pathway as human beings where people had to exercise indifference to be able to go on with their lives. I was angry that, like the young ER doctor and the hospital cleaning lady, it was somehow necessary for people to numb themselves in order to face what they had to face in their lives. I was angry that I had brought two children into this messed-up world of people hurting one another because we can’t do better. I was angry with the universe that had created the conditions for this dis-ease without giving us clear directions for healing. I knew that feeling. I had felt it before. I used to feel it when hating my body shape and trying to hurt it as a teenager, or wanting to wash away the brownness of my skin, or resenting the painful circumstances of my family. When these things surfaced, often in tandem with news of terrible things happening in the world, the next feeling was always one that can be best described as a grudge against the universe.

My grudge against the universe made me want to give up on everything and to rationalize why I should exit my physical body. This period of postpartum depression got really bad, to the point where I was very close to leaving my job and my family. I did not see any point in living. I did not want to pass this on to my kids and I could not stop it. I did not want to be a burden, neither did I want to sensationalize my death (and impose even more trauma on other people). I just wanted to fade away as quickly as possible—an uneventful exit. I would occasionally observe homeless people and wonder if some of them were not trying to do the same.

Where I lived, in Brazil, I would sometimes see Indigenous people in the city streets, but not very often. They were usually in groups, selling their art. Although they slept in parks or under overpasses, they were normally just traveling through; they didn’t live in the cities. I remembered my mother was born in such circumstances and something about it made me wonder if Indigenous relatives would have answers to the questions that were weighing on me. I decided I needed to find out before making a final decision about staying or not in this world.

It turned out that the relatives did not have the (kind of) answers I was expecting, but they were able to offer me something that was even more useful: they helped me process the teachings of the accident and change my relationship with my grudge against the universe and the spirit of depression associated with it (who is still around and pops up sometimes, but who is now less of a jerk and more of a teacher).

At the beginning of this journey I visited several Indigenous communities of my grandmothers’ ethnic group (Guaraní) in the region where she was born. I was always received very warmly because of my phenotypic traits. I could establish trust very quickly because I looked like my grandmother and all the other women of the community: same skin color, same height, same body type, less hair. I wondered if I would have been received in the same way if I looked whiter, or if I was taller, or if I had a different body shape. The Guaraní are mostly nomadic Indigenous people, and for this they pay a high price. Even when they try to settle for longer in that region, they are often violently threatened by evangelical religious communities that believe the Indigenous spirituality is evil. Guaraní spirituality centers Nhanderuvuçu (the eternal grandfather creator of everything on earth) and Jaci (the moon grandmother who gave him the idea to create things).

In the beginning, I thought that nomadism was a way of deflecting the state-sponsored violence against Indigenous people and the aggression of evangelical communities, but the more I learned, the more I saw that my analysis was wrong. One day I popped the question to one of the elders, Wera Mirim: why does the community move from one place to the other? He laughed and told me the question I had just asked was a common question that he usually received from white people. He said that he always found the question very ironic, coming from that group of immigrants. Then he told me that, since the land is alive, if we stay too long in one place, the land gets sick. There are signs that indicate when that is taking place. When this happens, the land sends a message to their ancestors about where it would be safe to go next. A metaphysical bureaucracy is then activated: in the next scheduled ceremony, the ancestors are fed so that they can deliver the message through dreams. In the days following the ceremony, someone in the community receives the encoded message and takes it to the dream decoder. He said this was like a series of telegrams. I remember laughing at the thought that this was a cosmic internet.

During this period, the scars of the accident were very pronounced, with keloids in my legs, especially where the screws were placed. The scars attracted a lot of interest and I was asked to tell the story of the accident numerous times to very attentive audiences who asked unusual questions. Their questions made me pay attention to things that seemed insignificant at the time, such as the kind(ness) of the tree I had crashed into, what I saw when I left my body in the car, how I returned to the body, and the sensation of my hand as I rhythmically tapped on the pool of my blood and urine on that metal table. Every time this story was told in this context, I could remember different sensations. One day, after telling the story for the tenth time, an elder started another long story that I thought was unrelated to the accident. Only decades later could I make the connection.

The elder started with a lengthy preamble about historical alliances and conflicts among Indigenous peoples in the region, and how his family was part of an important negotiation, like a treaty. Part of the story was the description of a ritual that another Indigenous community (from a different ethnic group) performed as a rite of passage for young people, which one of his uncles witnessed. As I remember, in this ritual a young person would be buried naked in the earth vertically, with only their head sticking out. They would be there for four days, without food or water. Since they could not move, they had to do their necessities in that same place. They would have a helper keeping a fire nearby and watching for dangerous animals.

On the first day of the ritual, members of the community were supposed to collectively bury the person singing this person’s praises. On the second and third days of the ritual, members of the community were supposed to come to the head in the ground and spit and shout insults at it. The buried young person was not supposed to respond. They had to accept everything in silence—but not as a form of submission, quite the opposite. The young person was supposed to find their grounding on the living land that held them for the four days. In this way, their sense of intrinsic worth would not be grounded in human interactions—including the opinions of other members of their own community—but in the sense that we are held by the land itself. At the end of the fourth day, the young person was physically cleaned by members of the community, there was a feast, and dream-stories were shared.

I remember asking the storyteller if all those insults did not leave an imprint in the young person for life, which seemed really dangerous to me. His response was that Indigenous people could not shelter from insults—they received them constantly from the dominant society, and from Indigenous people who were sick on the inside as well. He said that if young people’s self-esteem depended upon external validation from other people’s opinions (even in their own community), they would be vulnerable to the imprint of violence—including the white man’s violence (that was already within the community). If they depended on the praise of others for self-worth, they would not genuinely have trust in themselves, they would not trust the land, they would be weak and vulnerable to the white man’s diseases, and they could themselves become predators.

This contradicted everything I had been told at university about modern education. Modern education is meant to give us a sense of individuation (i.e., being distinct from other beings) and individuality (i.e., being separate from and often in competition with other beings). I could see how the ceremony worked with the principle of individuation, as a break from narrative-based human collectivity. However, human individuality was not part of the picture. Instead, the emphasis was on developing trust in being grounded in the physical and meta-physical “land,” in the inarticulable sense-fullness of non-separability that is the glue connecting everything. This has enormous implications for the embrace of both responsibility and accountability. What this ceremony wanted to teach young people seemed extremely important, so its intention landed deeply within me.

From that point on, I started to wonder what kind of educational approach could reproduce the directional intent of that ceremony (of young people grounding their intrinsic value on the land-metabolism) in non-Indigenous contexts. In other words, how would we support young people in metropolitan societies in setting boundaries to protect themselves from the toxicity around them, while grounding themselves in something that is not their ego or human narratives of worth (i.e., finding an unlimited source of vitality within)? Contrary to its proclaimed mission of empowerment, lifelong education based on uninterrupted positivity, unaccountable self-expression, constant praise, and validation seemed to be going precisely in the opposite direction. Rather than empowering, it was making people more fragile by affirming immature desires for self-infantilization grounded in an insatiable need for coddling and affirmation. This kind of education leaves young people empty of intrinsic worth, vulnerable to the toxicity of their environment, and unequipped to face difficulties and painful challenges. These concerns still guide my work as an educator.

The Long Return Home: The Body as the Land

It took two decades for me to make the connection between my accident and the burying ritual. When I first heard the story, I could only see the land as a separate spiritual entity, upholding the person’s body in/as the ground. Another Indigenous teaching that affirmed that my body is also the land took many years to “land” in my body. When I made the connection between the ritual and my accident, I finally could see myself in the same picture of the ritual: lying atop a pool of blood and urine for hours on a metal hospital table. Perhaps this is what the Guaraní elder was trying to tell me (or not!). That day in the hospital, when something clicked when the doctor told me to shut up, I started to anchor myself in something deeper and larger than human relations. This taught me that it was fundamentally my responsibility to keep myself alive, to have my own back, to put the oxygen mask on myself first, if I wanted to be useful to others. I learned that my well-being should not depend on the opinion or goodwill of others.

However, this was not the main teaching of this long rite of passage. It was my depression that brought me back to the central theme of this story, which is betrayal. I have only realized this recently, and this late realization was key to turning the _rite_ of passage into a _right_ of passage. I realized I felt betrayed by my body. I felt betrayed by having been born. My mother says that I was unusually sensitive, serious, angry, clever, and determined as a child, which both surprised and somewhat disappointed each of my parents. She tells a story about how, when I was three years old, I started asking her if I could go back “home” where I had come from. I told her that it must have been a delivery mistake, that I felt I should not have been brought to such a place where people were cruel toward one another and toward other beings.

To comfort me when that question reappeared many other times in my childhood, my mother would say that, at another plane, where we all come from and return to, there are no physical bodies, just timeless spirits. She tried to explain to me that I had chosen to come to this world in order to learn the lessons this place had to offer, and to share the lessons that I had come to share. For a long time, she felt that I was not convinced by her explanation because I would always respond to her efforts at comforting me by saying that if I had indeed chosen to be here, it had not been my brightest idea. Contrary to my mother’s reading of the situation, I was actually convinced there was truth in what she told me, but part of me resented the fact that I could have chosen to do this to myself. I think the way that I found to navigate this internal dissonance and high sensitivity to pain that made me so angry was to dissociate from my body and discern whatever task I had agreed with the universe to perform, and to work relentlessly to complete it in order to return “home” as soon as possible. Many stories guided me on this quest, but two of them were central to my realization that “home” is somewhere different than where I had originally imagined it would be.

The first story, which I heard from Cash Ahenakew (my partner at the time), speaks of a single body and soul where humans, animals, plants, and the land are all entangled with one another. One day, the right arm of this body fell ill and its sickness made it feel disgusted toward the left arm. In an act of defiance and attempt at emancipation, the right arm (representing settler-colonialism) tried unsuccessfully to sever the left arm (representing the land and Indigenous peoples). The left arm was left hanging by a thread of flesh and skin, with broken bones exposed. The left arm struggled to hold itself together, to reattach, but the infection and necrosis were advancing quickly (representing self-harm and lateral violence in Indigenous communities). The whole body got sick, the whole body was in pain, the soul was deeply wounded,[^4] but each arm sought a different form of relief. Cash used this story to talk about how Indigenous people sought to relieve the pain of dismemberment in ways that were different (trying desperately and most times unsuccessfully to stop the disease) from the ways that most settlers sought relief from the same pain (numbing, denying, and rewounding) without realizing that the infection created by the attempted amputation might turn out to be lethal for the whole body, if we don’t commit to healing.

The second story, which I have heard in association with many cultures, talks about a massive forest fire where all the animals had run away to a nearby mountain, feeling immobilized as they watched the forest where they lived burn down—all animals except for the hummingbirds. The hummingbirds flew to a nearby lake, each took a drop of water in their beaks, and then flew back into the forest trying to put the fire out, drop by drop. They would do this over and over. The other animals could not understand why these tiny birds were engaged in what they thought was both dangerous and pointless. They called the hummingbirds stupid and reckless. But the hummingbirds could not care about the other animals’ opinions; they were busy doing what they could to help the forest survive the fire. In my version of the story, after several runs to the lake, one of the hummingbirds separates from the flock to look for the dragon who scorched the forest.

These two stories resonate with the responsibility I have felt toward the systemic dis-ease that wounds the whole collective body, toward the burning forest, toward the indifference of the other animals, toward the dragon and the right arm. My mother’s teaching about responsibilities to learn and to teach kept me going even when life seemed dangerous and pointless. However, for most of this journey (so far), I have used my body as a prop to take my intellect and my spirit from place to place. I never wanted to be _in_ or _of_ my body. Likewise, I have always felt connected to the spirit of the land, but not to its materiality. I was probably unconsciously trying to avoid feeling the pain and cruelty inflicted upon it. I knew the materiality of forms decayed and changed and I wanted this change to happen faster, as a mode of liberation, of escaping “here” in order to go back “home.” It was only recently that I figured out my logic was flawed and that in my attempt to protect myself from betrayal, I had exiled myself from my body.

As I complete this rite of passage, I have started to realize that “home” is right here, in the imperfect, wounded, wounding, and vulnerable body and land we inhabit. I also realize that the desire to transcend the body does nothing to scar and heal its wounds. Being in an imperfect, wounded, wounding, and vulnerable (individual and collective) nested body is understandably overwhelming for an individual person. In this entangled metabolic context, healing is not something we can compartmentalize or do on our own—we need all hands, heads, hearts, guts, and feet on deck. However, those around us will be as fallible, faulty, and fabulous as we are: they cannot guarantee betrayal won’t happen and we cannot guarantee we won’t betray them. Everyone will seriously mess up and hurt others at some point and we will all need to hold space when it happens and figure out how to grow _down,_ and then _up and out_ of the mess, together. We also need all the forces we can summon to start to heal our thinking; our feeling; our modes of relating; our exchanges; and our capacity to face pain, grief, and joy in the cycles of life and death. This includes the erotic forces (both sexual and not) that belong in and work through the body—the same body I intended to refuse and transcend. These forces have been plasticized, commodified, and weaponized within modernity. Thus, figuring out how to reestablish healthy relationships with our bodies and the erotic forces that work through them is one of the greatest challenges we need to face together—if these forces are to help us to heal rather than to continue to wound one another.

The hummingbird that has, for the course of its lifetime, been obsessed with forest fires and dragons and driven my attention outward now turns around, looks at me, and tells me to integrate body and spirit, space and time, form and movement. She wants me to work toward the dragons _within_ me, not scorching forests; the settlers _within_ me, not amputating arms; the Indigenous relations _within_ me, not self-harming; and all other animals _within_ me, shaking themselves out of indifference. I am slowly learning that rather than being “in” the spirit or the body, I can be “with” both, and everything they are entangled with. “Home” is much larger, more diverse, and more complicated than I thought it would be.

Modernity dying, not on our terms, can also be considered a rite of passage for humanity. Different people will experience the element of severance in different ways. For some it will be something external, like social or environmental collapse. For many, this first interruption will be internal and marked by _dis_illusionments and _dis_enchantments with a broken culture that can no longer offer direction, vitality, sanity, or hope. Some will experience it early, preemptively; others will experience it late. After this severance, in the dangerous space of collective liminality, we will encounter our dis-eases, our monsters, our shadows, and our shit. Whether we can survive and return home will depend largely on the rehabilitation of forces that have been hijacked by modernity and the reactivation of capacities and dispositions that have been exiled—integration-without-separation being one of them.

What events in your life do you identify as rites of passage? How are they related to each other in terms of the lessons they taught you? How would you relate these teachings to the mountains in the story of the four mountains (i.e., were these teachings about becoming a warrior, a provider, or an elder)? When did betrayal lead you to wisdom? How long did it take? Who or what walked you into deeper understanding of the experience? How have you processed those teachings in ways that could help other people with their own learning? How will you prepare to face the rite of passage of modernity dying?

There Is No Away

At an Indigenous gathering in Brazil in 2010, I was told that there are three ways of imagining society: individualism, collectivism, and metabolism.[^1] It took me several years to wrap my ahead around what _metabolism_ meant in that comparative frame. The best definition I can offer, with the language I have—and this is my own interpretation—is to say that metabolism evokes nested systems and entities that operate in rhythms and cycles and that are constantly exchanging and processing energy and matter. In the language of modernity, seeing the planet as a metabolism can only be used as a metaphor that gestures toward something that is living, that contains us, and that has a much longer temporality than humanity. The metaphor of metabolism is an invitation to seeing everyone and everything (human, nonhuman, seen, unseen, known, unknown, and unknowable) as _nested_ living entities engaged in nonlinear movement, in nonlinear time.

Some people now talk about a “metabolic turn”[^2] in the sciences, where a mechanistic view of human and nonhuman bodies is being slowly replaced by a more organic and dynamic image of entangled shape-shifting matter. However, unlike the scientists that are now paying more attention to metabolic processes, the way I use the word _metabolism_ here is not representing something that humans (who are a small part of a greater metabolic entity) can fathom. In this sense, metabolism has its own bio-metaphysical intelligence, authority, and autonomy that are integrated with, but much larger than human intelligence, authority, and autonomy.

However, for many Indigenous people, the reality of metabolism (whether they use this word for it) is not a concept or a metaphor—it is a “thing thinging” and we are part of it. Through the sensibility of separability that has been imposed by modernity, it is still very difficult to fathom what relating to the world as a metabolism beyond concepts and metaphor feels, tastes, and looks like. We have lost the metabolic literacies necessary to notice and sense how we are entangled with everything else. Modernity has vigorously attempted to eliminate these literacies and it actively selects against them: people who choose to hold on to these ancestral literacies tend to disidentify with (or reject) the metropolitan consumerist individualism that is necessary for social mobility. Thus, these literacies are exiled from the house of modernity.

I have had many teachers of metabolic literacies, but the most impactful one has been Mama Maria Jara Qquerar. As part of my attempts to learn about my Indigenous grandmother’s history, twenty years ago I went to Valle Sagrado (Sacred Valley) in Peru to search for relatives. I could not find them there, but I got lost and was found (literally) by a Quechua family who since then became part of my own. For the past two decades, through regular visits, we have supported each other as life unfolded in each context. Mama Maria, the matriarch, took my son in when he needed support in his teenage years. He is _our_ son now.

I have witnessed with awe and been inspired by her work. She is a force of nature who does not stop for a second. She is relentless in her commitment to the health and well-being of everything and everyone around her. She hates being seen as a guru because her practice and teachings are about staying humble and about accountability. Mama Maria is like all of us: she is an imperfect human being who makes mistakes and needs good friends to call her out sometimes. It took me fifteen years and a lot of mileage on the road together for me to do that for the first time. There are numerous stories I could tell about what we have lived together, but I chose those that taught me the most about metabolism.

Toilet Protocols

Mama Maria’s place in Pincheq, near Pisac is a piece of land at the top of a steep hill. When I met her twenty years ago, it had three small adobe buildings. The one with the thatched roof was the kitchen, and it had been built by her great-grandma a hundred years before. The other two buildings, with tin roofs, were small bedrooms that also worked as living areas. There was no toilet on site. None. When I visited, she would insist that I take one of the two adobe tin-roofed buildings for the length of my stay, while the rest of the family (five people, including small children) would sleep in the other building. I always felt embarrassed to take up so much space and tried to argue my way out of it, but there is no arguing about hospitality with Mama Maria!

Another thing that made me really uncomfortable in the beginning was the toilet protocol. Every night, Mama Maria would bring a bucket to my door with a huge smile on her face. In the morning, I was expected to hand her back the bucket with liquids and solids inside. I am convinced the huge smile was there to disarm me—she knew I would try to resist letting go of my bucket and she was ready to gracefully and humorously stand her ground. The first time she came for my bucket in the morning, I refused to hand it in. She insisted. I felt really attached to my bucket. I hugged it close and told her that I would dispose of the contents myself. She wouldn’t have me do that. She explained to me that I would not know what to do: that the liquids would go in one place, with one type of potato peels; and that the solid stuff would go somewhere else, in another compost pile that served a different purpose. Besides, it was rainy and muddy and the terrain was steep, so it would definitely be more work for everyone if I fell and broke my ankle, than to just hand in the bucket. I knew I could not win that argument. I had to put my pride and vanity aside and surrender the bucket. In our relationship, the practice of handing in the bucket, and later of holding the bucket, were to be repeated copious times—both literally and metaphorically.

In one of the visits I asked her if I could shadow her for a week in her daily routine. My university had a study abroad program that made it possible for me to send students to visit and be taught by Mama Maria’s community. However, before sending the students, I wanted to assess the social, economic, and cultural impact that this program could have in the local context. We tend to think about exchange visits as only beneficial, but exchange students and volunteers can be a lot of work and I did not want to see the community’s labor exploited or their daily lives disrupted for the benefit of already very privileged and often very entitled people. So, Mama Maria agreed that I could shadow her for a week. The experience lasted forty-five minutes. She hated being followed around and I also felt very awkward. I asked her if, instead of shadowing her, I could help her with anything. She was offended by the question—what made me think I could be of any help to her? She felt patronized, as if I was treating her like a charity case and she was not happy about that. I subsequently learned that self-reliance and independence are highly valued in Quechua culture.

Then, she turned it around and said, “I can help _you._” I was caught off-guard, but agreed nevertheless. She said: “You don’t look like you can sell anything. I could train you as a street vendor. You can spend the week helping me at the _tienda_ [small shop] in Pisac.” I saw no other choice. For the next seven days I trained as a street vendor in Pisac. The first thing she did, with great gusto, was to gather all the other women and kids in the family to dress me up like the other local women. I wore long white socks with colorful alpaca leg warmers; several _polleras_ (skirts) one on top of the other to increase volume, fastened by a _chumpi_ (belt); a lacy white shirt with a _jobona_ (colorful wool jacket) and _lliclla_ (cape) on top; and a black bowler hat (yes, you read that right). In my new attire, my stylists told me, I was indistinguishable from the other vendors. My Spanish (or Portunhol, a mashup of Portuguese and Spanish) was passable at the time, but they also insisted that I learn some Quechua to add to the experience. I was supposed to sell handmade bracelets for around $2 apiece and also help at the _tienda._ Mama Maria said I would get a commission on my sales.

Relational Economies

The experience was completely disastrous in terms of improving my ability to sell anything, but that had nothing to do with Mama Maria’s training protocols, which were incredible. It was also painful in terms of understanding the political economy of the place, especially when it came to the extractive attitude of most tourists and the role of foreign tourism agencies in sustaining predatory practices that exploited Indigenous communities. But the experience was also extremely rich in terms of observing how capitalism was somewhat “tamed” by the local community in ways that were extremely clever, compassionate, and humbling (for me).

While I spent my time for the most part really angry at the tourists’ rudeness, selfishness, and narcissism, Mama Maria saw them as lost and confused. She would repeat to me: “Don’t be mad, they don’t know better. They believe money is everything, they have got a long way to go.” She was always worried that my irritation was going to affect my capacity to learn how to sell the bracelets. She needed me to release the anger and calm down in order to learn how to “read” what the tourists were looking for (whether it was something material or spiritual, driven by consumerist or existential motives) and change my approach accordingly. In my training as a vendor she told me I should offer tourists what they were looking for, plus a little more that could help them in their journey. I was also told I should inflate the price by 20% and sell for the cost-recovery price at 60% if I felt it was necessary, but most tourists were bargaining to buy things for half of the price or less.

One of these experiences was very impactful to me. A Swedish middle-aged lady approached me for a conversation (she wanted to practice her basic Spanish) and asked me to help her find a bracelet for her niece. We talked, she chose a bracelet, and I was happy I was about to make a rare sale. Then her husband approached us and asked how much she was paying for the bracelet ($2). He stopped her from handing me the money, saying that the bracelet was only worth 50 cents. I asked him, in English, how much the minimum wage was in his country and if he knew how long it took to weave a bracelet like that. His wife was furious—with me! She did not expect to hear me speak English and she was not happy that I challenged her husband. My response disrupted the fantasies of benevolent protagonism (of being the central virtuous characters of a romantic, adventurous, or heroic story) they felt they had paid for. She aggressively took my hand and put both the bracelet and the money in it. She told me that I should give the money to my family, because since she set foot in “my country” all she had done was charity (and there she reclaimed the story she had paid for).

I considered how Mama Maria and the other vendors had to put up with this patronizing behavior toward them every single day and I felt both absolutely furious and completely powerless. I went back to the _tienda_ and cried out of frustration. As I was crying, I was worried that I and my emotional outburst were not helping Mama Maria’s business. Mama Maria came to my rescue with _água florida_ (cleansing flower water) and branches of rue (also for cleansing and protection). She took a sip of _água florida_ and spat it on my head. She then whacked me with the rue branches for a while. I stopped crying and my outrage turned into indignation, which gave me a huge surge of motivation to act. I remembered I was also a professor and that I could do something. I mounted my imaginary high horse, and, with my hands defiantly on my hips, I told Mama Maria that I would create a project for ethical tourism in the region that would teach those tourists to behave properly. Mama Maria could not help but burst out laughing at the ridiculousness of what she saw. To my own surprise, instead of feeling offended by her laughing at me like that, I started to laugh as well—uncontrollably. She had held back a mirror and it was the first time I could see myself as cute and pathetic. And it was the most liberating thing I had ever felt. This wordless teaching was also eventually transformed into a recurrent practice.

During that week, I observed how the local economy worked on a relational basis. Resources were distributed according to needs; no one was planning too much for the end of the month. They believed their responsibility was to keep the flow of reciprocities going in the collective bodies, including in the relationship with spirits and ancestors, so that metabolic regeneration and abundance could take place.

In this worldview, one thing is clear: accumulation leads to scarcity. Period. It took awhile for that teaching to land for me. By the end of the week, I was worried that I had not sold anything in the streets and I could see that the shop had not sold much either, probably because I was always angry and my vibe drove the customers away. I felt responsible for a week’s lost income and I was worried about the rent that Mama Maria would have to pay, and I knew she would not take any money from me as a donation. So, I decided to make a purchase from the shop at the value of a month’s rent. Since I knew the prices of things, I made a pile of gifts for family that would both fit in my bag and enable me to offer her the money for the rent. As Mama Maria started to add up the prices of the merchandise, she kept giving me huge discounts (not part of my plan), which forced me to include more items to make up for the amount I wanted to spend. I ended up with more things than would fit in my luggage.

She knew I was up to something, so she asked why I was buying so much. I told her everything—about the guilt, and the plans for the rent. She sat me down again to kindly tell me that she had always been able to pay the rent—that her rent was not my business. She took the money and showed me how she would spend it. She paid for meals for people in neighboring shops who had been struggling. She bought a stock of bracelets (despite having hundreds of those at the shop) to help a street vendor who needed to feed her family. She helped her neighbor pay the rent for her restaurant. She bought _granadillas_—similar to passion fruit—for us and all the kids playing in the street. By the afternoon, the money I thought should have been saved for rent at the end of the month was all gone. She was really happy to work in _ayni,_ the Andean practice of entangled reciprocity and of becoming “common.” I was really impressed about how she could operate in a brutal capitalist context without being determined by it.

## Exercise

Although modernity defines large economic structures and expectations, practices of value exchange are passed down (or rebelled against) in families. For example, from the German side of my family I learned that you never spend more than you earn and that you need to build provisions for rainy days, both for yourself and for those around you. From the other side I learned that these provisions need to be small; otherwise they block the flows of abundance and vitality in your life: you may be financially wealthy, but you become existentially poor. I was also told something along the lines of “the bread that you withhold is not yours to keep, because it will go moldy in your cupboard while others go hungry.”

Both sides had an element of care for others, which I am really grateful for, but the current tendency within modernity, of economies based on debt, lends itself to economic practices that are immediate-pleasure-oriented and egotistical. I invite you to reflect about these issues in relation to what you have been exposed to in your family or immediate community. What economic practices have you embraced or pushed back on? How do these practices limit or enable different possibilities in your existence? How do these practices manifest your accountability toward other people (e.g., those who pay the real costs of your comforts) and toward the planet?

Toilet Teachings

Still, during that visit to Mama Maria’s, I was obsessed with my discomfort with the toilet protocols at her house. I even tried to convince her that I should stay in the town of Pisac for her convenience (and my toilet access), but she would not have it. Toward the end of the visit, I learned that I could leave some money behind as long as each amount was marked for a specific future purpose (so that it was neither charity nor payment); for example, I could leave a $50 contribution toward her son’s school uniform, another $50 toward the replacement of the thatched roof in the kitchen that I heard was going to take place, etc. In my list of contributions, I sneaked in $100 for a toilet. The protocol was to hand her the money and explain quickly what projects the funds were for. She accepted it, thanked me, and we both went back to cooking chores. Then it hit me. Why did I still want a toilet? It occurred to me I had not really asked her what she herself felt needed to be done in the house. There were a number of things she wanted to improve or renovate, but a toilet was not one of them. I asked her if I could change my contribution and reallocate the money for the toilet toward another priority she had identified. She agreed. Then I asked her why she had accepted the request for a toilet. She told me that they would build one just for me, if that made me want to come back more often. Her priorities and generosity left me speechless.

For a long while afterward I started to pay attention to modernity’s obsession with flush toilets. I knew of several fundraising projects for building flush toilets in underserved communities. I had heard of a development project in a village in Nigeria where German engineers had built toilets that were repeatedly destroyed by members of the community. They figured out later that the women vandalized the toilets because the only time they could gather without male surveillance was when they would get together to do their thing in the bushes. They did not want to lose that. On my next visit, I also observed how flush toilets were resisted by peasant women in another village in Peru. An NGO wanted to bring tourists to their village and had told them that, since the tourists would need the toilets, they might as well build one in each of the houses. To the NGOs, toilets were a sign of social mobility and the villagers should be grateful and happy with the offer. But this was not the case. The women said they could build a house with toilets for the tourists, but they did not want flush toilets in their own houses. To the NGOs, these women were backward and unappreciative. One person even called them “uncivilized.” I quietly asked one of the women from the village why she thought the flush toilets were a bad idea. She told me that they would lose the ability to “read.” We got interrupted at that point and I was left wondering what _reading_ could mean in that context.

Modernity is fixated on a project of perfect form, efficient functionality, and maximum regulation, including sanitary regulation. The intention is to control nature and to achieve timeless permanence—to defeat decomposition and death. In order to do that, modernity needs to hide the shit. Flush toilets are a great way of doing that. Flush toilets have been designed to sanitize our metabolic reality. We sit comfortably, dump our shit in clear water, and with a magic flush, the shit disappears; it is taken “away” forever. However, if we can pause for a second our sense of separability inherited from modernity, in order to see the planet as a dynamic metabolism, we may realize that there is no “away”: our shit goes somewhere even if we don’t know exactly where or face any responsibility for it.

When reflecting about flush toilets, I realized that _reading_ for the woman in the village could be about seeing the cycle of shit becoming land, and then food, and then shit again. It could also be about reading the shit itself to interpret how the body is processing food in order to detect illnesses and imbalances. Or it could be about getting out of the house to read the context outside, while you are doing your thing. Like Mama Maria who knew what to do with liquids and solids in my bucket, this woman had metabolic literacies that modernity had deprived me of. It was clear in this case that my privilege was also a loss of capacity to “read” a lot of things. In this sense, modernity’s toilets make us illiterate: we lose the capacity to read what comes out of our bodies and how that part of us goes back into the land to feed other beings that in turn feed us as well. Without practices of metabolic literacies we cannot see ourselves as living metabolisms nested in wider metabolisms. Having the flush toilet as the “most civilized” practice of shitting is a terrible idea from a metabolic perspective. Flush toilets reinforce the belief that we are separate individuals entitled to poop comfortably, to send shit away with the water, and to never have to think about it again. This could be what both women in Peru were trying to avoid. Metaphorically speaking, this aversion, avoidance, and lack of ability to compost shit may be what got us into the mess we are in.

## Exercise

Everything you put in your mouth is either already dead or dying and will be decomposed, or is alive and will add to the living ecology of your guts. Every day each person poops an average of 500 grams of fecal matter. We have around 7.8 billion people alive today. You can do the math yourself. Remember that this is just organic stuff that decomposes relatively easily; the other “shit” we discard (like plastics and other waste toxic to us and the metabolism) is much more difficult—and there is more of it.

Another interesting fact is that we have prayers for things that go into our bodies, but not for what comes out. Across cultures, we have practices of gratitude toward those responsible for bringing the food to our tables. Some cultures also pray for the food to give them health and strength to be in service of others. But, what would a prayer look like for what we return to the earth? Who or what would you be grateful for? What could be a good prayer for your shit and the land that will receive it (think beyond your own digestion)? If everything is sacred, pooping should not be an exception. What do you think your toilet socialization has given you and deprived you of? The next time you need to go to the toilet, pause for a while as things are brewing, and contemplate that part of you that will be released in a metabolic cycle that does not stop with the flush.

Metabolic Literacies

Trying to experience the world and ourselves in it as metabolism gives us one way of recalibrating our existence—away from separability and toward entanglement. The sensibility of knowledge-mediated hierarchical separability imposed by modernity, which is based on human exceptionalism, transactional interactions, and expansion of consumptive entitlements, has led us to cause the extinction of countless beings and brought us to the brink of human extinction. Metabolism, even if just used as a metaphor (which is what we can do from within modernity) can help us move toward a sensibility of metabolic entanglement based on the call for maturity, sobriety, discernment, and responsibility toward realness and healing and for relationships grounded on trust, respect, consent, reciprocity, and accountability.[^3]

Metabolic literacies are about intake, process, integration, and output in nested layers. I can also say that this language is extremely limited and mechanistic. There is much it cannot express in relation to our metabolic reality, in the same way that there is a great deal we cannot even see or imagine because of the patterns of sensing, relating, and desiring that we have inherited from modernity. As a starting point, let us imagine four juxtaposed layers of metabolism: me (my individual temporal body, which is also a nested system for other entities), me and you (the many social bodies both human and nonhuman we inhabit), me in you (the planetary body, where we are all “in,” which is a larger entity with a much longer temporality), and us in neither me nor you—which refers to our existence beyond time, form, and space.

One of the most difficult things to explain about Quechua and other Indigenous worldviews is the fact that the ancestors are also an active part of the metabolic reality. Just as tangible as the plants that grow in the fields, the ancestors who have gone before and are yet to come are integral to the ecology. Ancestors belong in the layer of existence beyond time, form, and space; therefore those who have come before and those yet to come are part of the same ethereal matter (whether one believes in reincarnation or not).

Ancestors are also special because they can intervene across metabolic layers and negotiate on our behalf. These negotiations can include anything from how diseases are healed, the amount of rain that will secure the crops, and the good fortune of businesses, to the trajectory of our livelihoods. This is one of the reasons why it is important that education in this life also prepares us to become good ancestors on the other side, and for ourselves in the next life. The ancestors need to be “fed” and therefore offerings are necessary. The importance placed on the ancestors can be observed very clearly when catastrophes happen—people will use the scarce resources they have to make the offerings even if it means going without food or other necessities. In this worldview, misfortunes are caused by blockages in the flows of reciprocity of the metabolism and if this is not rectified right away more misfortune of one type or another will follow.

The first time I visited Mama Maria, I was taken to the thatched roof building by her daughter Noemi. Outside the building, she told me that her _abuelita_ (grandma), the daughter of the woman who had built the kitchen, had died a few years before at the tender age of 110. She then invited me into the kitchen to meet the _abuelita._ The building was dark and I could not see much. I was expecting to be shown a picture of her. Suddenly, Noemi said, “There she is!” She reached for something in the adobe wall, picked it up, and placed it in my hands. It was _abuelita’s_ skull! I froze right there, with _abuelita_ so close. This was an intimate encounter I was not prepared for. Noemi did not even notice that my brain had not yet adapted to the situation, and she kept talking. She mentioned that _abuelita_ protects the house and talks to the spirits at night and that there is evidence of that because her teeth are still wearing out. She then opened _abuelita’s_ mouth, the skull still in my hands, to show me the white marks on the brown teeth. I just stood there, frozen. With _abuelita._ Somehow, at one layer, _abuelita’s_ bones were also my own. Time stood still for a while. We were both dead and alive somewhere, sharing a moment. Next thing I remember was the _cui_ (guinea pigs) running in the kitchen.…

I learned very quickly that offerings to the earth and mountains were really important. _Quintos_ (three coca leaves arranged as a fan) were offered to the _apus_ (mountains), the winds, and each other any time there was a chance to do so during the day. Individuals and families had regular _pagos_ (offerings) performed by local shamans and any new project (such as building a house or starting a business) required a larger offering as well. In Peru, you can buy a package for these offerings in special shops. Each package comes with more than fifty different items wrapped in pieces of newspaper. The items range from grains, seeds, dried fruit and herbs, coca leaves, sweets, llama fat, Monopoly money, ribbons, alphabet pasta, confetti, wax figurines, and—the most important part—a dried llama fetus. These items evoke different commitments and manifestations that remind you of your embeddedness in a wider metabolism. They conjure up abundance, well-being, joy, prosperity, security, vitality, fertility, balance, good fortune, and protection from jealousy, envy, disease, anger, and bad luck. The _pagos_ need to be burned in a ceremonial fire. Specific wood crackles, types of flame, and the color of the ashes produced in the burning process tell whether the _pagos_ were well received by Pachamama or the _apus._ Not all offerings are successful and some go down all too well.

In one of my visits, I took a group of practitioners from Central European NGOs to be taught by Mama Maria and to assist her in the creation of an educational center. There were many complicated negotiations involved in this—from the title of the project, its aims, to whether there would be a website or any written materials about it. There were many things that needed to be decided by the community, and the process was really slow because everyone was busy with regular work. Despite the strong drive of the European NGOs to get the community together and get things done, the more the community felt pressured, the less we saw of them. This is passive resistance to what can be perceived as a forced imposition that resonates with colonialism. For Mama Maria, nothing could be started without first offering a _pago,_ but the local shaman, Don Isidro, was also very busy and could only come the following weekend. In the middle of this, I received some news that meant I had to cut my trip short and leave in two days. Mama Maria would not let me leave without making a personal offering. She told Don Isidro that this was an emergency situation and that he needed to come right away.

The next morning Don Isidro showed up early, but warned us that he had other clients waiting and had to leave by midday. Mama Maria asked him to read the coca leaves to decide how and where my offering should take place. The coca leaves told us that the offering needed to be burned at the nearby mountaintop. I was worried about my flight the following day and about Don Isidro’s other clients, so I said it would be okay to burn my offering where we were. Mama Maria would have none of it. She convinced Don Isidro to take us up the mountain. My son, who was living there at the time, came with us. Halfway to the top, Don Isidro said that he had run out of time and that the fire would have to be made where we stopped. My son and I noticed all the dry grass surrounding us. We looked at each other and we both thought, “They must know what they are doing.” At the time, there was no wind, so it seemed somewhat safe. As Don Isidro started the fire, a gust of wind appeared out of nowhere and I could see flames rising to Don Isidro’s height.

Totally calm, Don Isidro told me to lie on the ground, next to the rising flames, with my _pago_ on top of my head. My son looked at me and asked if we shouldn’t, perhaps, call the fire brigade. I reminded him that we were in the middle of the Andes and that it was unlikely that a fire brigade would easily reach that place. At this point I remembered the story of a Czech tourist in Chile who started a fire that destroyed thousands of hectares of the Chilean part of the Patagonia National Park. I could already see the newspaper headlines announcing: “Brazilian mother and son burn down half of Peru.” Meanwhile, the fire had spread widely across the ground, eating into the slope of the mountain with the flames up to five meters tall. Unfazed, Don Isidro still wanted me to lie on the ground. I explained that I would not be doing that and instead I started to shout for help. Mama Maria had already run to the foothill to try to get other people to bring water. In five minutes we had the community and the NGO people forming a chain of buckets around the fire. Don Isidro was still meticulously guarding a precious little flame for my offering, which happened eventually without me lying on the burnt ground.

I felt awful and responsible for the fire. I spent the afternoon with Mama Maria debriefing the situation. She was as traumatized as I was. That night the whole community finally came together and we could also do some work on the project of the educational center. We started the gathering with an assessment of the fire event. My offering had resulted in us burning one of the faces of the mountain, destroying a large patch of San Pedro cacti. The community’s analysis of the event was very interesting. There could be a number of reasons why this had happened, they said. And each of the reasons would require a different restorative measure. The first reason brought up negligence on the part of Don Isidro, who shouldn’t have rushed things. But there were also other reasons. The strong gust of wind appearing out of nowhere was a sign of ancestral intervention. The fire and the mountain also had their own messages to deliver. There was also a teaching in the mass sacrifice of the sacred cacti. The event was a means for the community to be brought together again. The upcoming educational center needed a name. _Los Chamuscados_ (the Singed Ones) was the first suggestion. The name of the center ended up being the name of the mountain that had been scorched: Apu Chupaqpata.

The gathering had started in a somber tone, given the gravity of what could have happened, but reliving the experience together helped us laugh at our own absurdities. Although I was relieved that nobody placed any blame on me, I was sorry for Mama Maria, who was not entirely off the hook. Don Isidro was not welcome back to the community for quite some time, but he repented and was eventually forgiven. Since we had the community in the room and a new name for the educational center, we took the opportunity to ask what people felt the center should be about. The conversation focused on Quechua teachings about life and education. The community was reluctant to have anything they said written down. Their experience was that writing distorts the teachings by fixing them in just one form and that seeing things in writing makes us believe that we have already accomplished something when the work has not even started. The NGO people acknowledged the risks and asked the community if they could make an exception that day. They received consent to write down ten principles that were articulated for the educational center Apu Chupaqpata that evening, on the condition that these principles will always be presented as a glimpse of a much larger body of wisdom that requires discipline and practice, way beyond reading and writing:

1. The entire planet Earth (i.e., Pachamama) is my home and country, my country is my mother, and my mother knows no borders.
2. We are all brothers and sisters: humans, rocks, plants, animals, and all others.
3. Pachamama is a mother pregnant with another generation of nonpredatory children who can cultivate, nurse, and balance forces and flows, and who know that any harm done to the planet is harm done to oneself.
4. The answers are in each one of us, but it is difficult to listen when we are not in balance; we hear too many different voices, especially in the cities.
5. The priority for life and education is balance: to act with wisdom, to balance material consumption, to learn to focus on sacred spiritual relationships, to work together with the different gifts of each one of us, with a sense of oneness. Our purpose is to learn, learn, and learn again (in many lives) to become better beings.
6. There is no complete knowledge, we all teach, learn, and keep changing: it is a path without an end. There is knowledge that can be known and described, there is knowledge that can be known but not described, and there is knowledge that cannot be known or described.
7. Our teachers are the _apus_ (the mountain-ancestors), Pachamama, the plants, what we live day by day and what has been lived before, the animals, our children, our parents, the spirits, our history, our ancestors, the fire, the water, the wind, all the different elements around us.
8. The serpent, the puma, and the condor are symbols of material and nonmaterial dimensions; of that which can be known; of that which cannot be known or determined; and of the connections between all things.
9. The traditional teachings of generosity, of gratitude, and of living in balance that are being lost are very important for our children—it is necessary to recover them.
10. The world is changed through love, patience, enthusiasm, respect, courage, humility, and living life in balance. The world cannot be changed through wars, conflicts, racism, anger, arrogance, divisions, and borders. The world cannot be changed without sacred spiritual connections.[^4]

These principles underscore a metabolic sensibility where nobody can be overlooked. Everything and everyone is a teacher and a learner at the same time. We are all nested in a larger metabolism driven by a metabolic intelligence. If this metabolism is sick, so are we. If we have made it sick and thus made ourselves sick, we have two options: either we heal or we die. We will need to choose between metabolic integration and regeneration or self-destruction. There is no middle way. And there is no “away.” And because it is urgent and we are running out of time, we need to slow down in order to grow up.

The teachings of this chapter were significant because they outpaced the speed of modernity of my thoughts, and forced adaptations that had ripple effects. They involved elements of surprise (seeing myself as cute and pathetic for the first time); of being taught about responsibility (being trained to sell bracelets without anger and facing the prospect of being responsible for a major wildfire); of release (surrendering my bucket to Mama Maria and my anger at the tourists); and of (re)integration (sensing timelessness with Noemi’s grandma). These teachings forced me to confront the limits of modernity both within and around me and they keep teaching me new things every time I revisit them.

For the past four years, Mama Maria has become a very active mentor and advisor in my research collective. In March 2020, a group of twenty of us, including Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, from Brazil and Canada, visited our partner communities in Brazil and Peru. We were the last people to cross the terrestrial Peruvian border before a state of emergency was declared in the country due to COVID-19. Since all the airports were closed, those of us from Canada had to stay with Mama Maria’s family much longer than we had originally planned. We were eventually repatriated back to Canada. During this last visit, we watched her tirelessly looking after all of us, while she looked after the land, the ancestors, and her family. Many of us noticed that Mama Maria had become an archetypal image of human accountability for the group. I use the term _human_ here in its broadest sense: Mama Maria is a flawed, fallible, fabulous friend who teaches us to be accountable in at least four different layers.

First, Mama Maria’s accountability refers to the visibilization of the metabolic processes we are all part of. This accountability can be initially exercised as a calculation of the labor, costs, debts, and harms involved in keeping us alive. These include the labor of the land; the labor of the other animals and plants (including the bacteria in our guts); the disproportionate amount of devalued and invisibilized labor; as well as the loss, pain, and sacrifices of those at the receiving end of historical, systemic, and ongoing violence.[^5]

Second, Mama Maria’s accountability refers to limiting excesses and indulgences, and redistributing both abundance and burdens. In this sense, it compels us to follow her example: do what is needed rather than what you want to do.

Third, Mama Maria’s accountability refers to a commitment to not adding unnecessarily to these burdens. In our collective we say that “due diligence” refers to getting our shit together, so we do not add to Mama Maria’s labor.

Fourth, Mama Maria’s accountability refers to a commitment to “growing up”—to manifesting the unlimited generosity of Mama Maria in our commitment to becoming healthy and responsible elders and ancestors for all relations. If we want to activate the possibility for existing “otherwise,” we first need to become much more like this side of Mama Maria: renouncing our desires for the unrestricted autonomy and consumption that modernity sanctions, and embracing accountable autonomy and response-ability.

Having said that, it is important not to idealize or romanticize Mama Maria as a human being. Romantic projections and idealizations are not sustainable and violate the integrity of Mama Maria’s humanness and learning process. If you visit Mama Maria today, you will see that the thatched roof houses have been replaced by a much larger house where groups of visitors can stay. There are five bedrooms and each bedroom has a private flush toilet.

## Exercise

When you think about accountability, what image comes to your mind? Make a list of everything and everyone to whom you are (or think you should be) accountable. Think about people in your closest circles, but also those far and out of sight, like the people whose lands were mined for the metals of your computer, the cheap labor involved in the production of your food and clothing, or the forests that were cut down for the production of this book. How long is your list? When you think about response-ability, how many passengers on your bus feel inept or inadequate? How many of your passengers insist on doing what they want rather than what needs to be done? How can you invite these passengers not to turn their backs to responsibility? How can you invite all your passengers to learn to build relations (with everything and everyone) based on trust, respect, reciprocity, consent, and accountability, as Kyle Whyte suggests?

I invite you to recall a situation in your life where you had to confront modernity within yourself, and to write up the story for yourself to make the ripple effects visible. Think about an event that really taught you something. Go with the hunch and just write what you remember for five minutes, uninterrupted, without censoring or correcting yourself. Let the processing of the story happen through the writing, rather than in advance. See what happens.

As Things Fall Apart

Before reading this last chapter, I invite you to go back to “ground zero,” the “Warm-up: Into the Future” chapter in part I, with the Education 2048 thought experiment. Read that chapter again and observe what (if anything) has changed for you in terms of how you relate to stories and how you see yourself and the world around you.

After the end of World War II, for a period of time the fulfillment of many of the promises of modernity seemed possible. The dreams of fair governance through rational democratic consensus; progress through science and technology; prosperity through economic growth and development; and the realization of ideals of universal human rights, basic health care, education, equity, and social mobility for all looked achievable and realistic. And I must admit that these things can sound appealing if we don’t consider the means modernity uses to achieve these ends and the historical, relational, and ecological costs of these aspirations. However, when you look closer, not only is the picture much more complex, but the context we find ourselves in is very different from that of the period after World War II.

Over the past thirty years, technology has changed our attention span and how we relate to knowledge; the way we selectively process fragments of information has limited our capacity to achieve functional consensus. Hyper-individualism has eroded our sense of the public good. Mass consumerism has deteriorated our willingness and capacity for being accountable, and eroded our ability to discern between wants and needs. Our particular ideal of prosperity has led us to reach the limits of our planet’s carrying capacity. Social media has unrestrained our vanity and taught us to “like” narcissism: we want to treat reality the same way we Photoshop our social media profiles and when reality refuses to be selected, cropped, and edited out, we are left unequipped to deal with it. The single story of modernity is no longer tenable, which has led to a host of different outcomes, including an increased sense of anxiety regarding not only the fulfillment of modernity’s promises, but also a general lack of certainty and guaranteed futurity. The end of modernity may not manifest primarily as economic or ecological collapse, but as a global mental health crisis where the structures of modernity within us start to crumble.

Because of the way modernity has socialized us to find security in certainty, stability, and predictability, as things start to fall apart we will seek out ways to fulfill these desires. We will seek plastic intellectuality, plastic sensuality, plastic artistry. We will shop for plastic certainties that can be consumed in soundbites. We will binge on certainties that can take the bitterness away, give us comfort, lift our hearts, and keep us numbed to the pain for a little longer. We will shop for packaged products wrapped in universal meanings, individual purpose, and hope in the future. They will promise to restore our sense of merit and virtue, of empowerment and agency, and of sovereignty and autonomy.

In the supermarket of soundbite options, there are a variety of certainties to choose from and you can mix and match as you please. There are certainties that come as a text (an analysis, framework, or formula) through which we can script ourselves into something already written as a redemptive prophecy of history or progress (e.g., critical theories, green deals, doughnut economics, science, or the Bible). There are certainties that come as a projection placed upon a person or a group who are seen as more deserving, heroic, wise, or virtuous and whose knowledge can rescue or liberate everyone (e.g., youth, elders, the most oppressed, experts, or a populist leader). Certainties can be packaged as universal solutions or practices, such as a project, a technique, a methodology, or a form of discipline that can heal or fix what is broken and restore innocence and purity (e.g., technotopias, organic farming, Westernized yoga, psychedelics, meditation, the self-care industry, prayer, protest). Certainties can also be placed upon a notion of time, space, or origin where things were or will be “in order” in the past or the future—before or after capitalism, colonialism, slavery, (post)modernity, neoliberalism, culture wars, the pandemic, or “Western civilization.”

As things fall apart, for a window of time some who have been at the margins will have a chance to experience a plastic form of redress as people will seek out their knowledge—but only to consume it. This consumption of marginalized knowledge is driven by the search for “answers” for how to either reform modernity, or build a prefabricated alternative to it. When this happens, it will be very tempting to feel that finally the oppressors will be proven wrong because _our_ knowledge is right and we knew it all along. However, customers will only buy what is convenient and what comes cheap, without major efforts or substantial changes. Genuine teachings will be distorted by this market (for both sellers and customers) and the truth in it will be dissolved without people even noticing it. A lot of time and energy will be wasted there. Beyond the fact that these marginalized knowledges will be selectively consumed, it is also important to note that not everything at the margins offers something new or generative.

Before anything different can happen, before people can sense, hear, relate, and imagine differently, there must be a clearing, a decluttering, an initiation into the unknowable; and a letting go of the desires for certainty, authority, hierarchy, and of insatiable consumption as a mode of relating to everything. We will need a genuine severance that will shatter all projections, anticipations, hopes, and expectations in order to find something we lost about ourselves, about time/space, about the depth of the shit we are in, about the medicines/poisons we carry. This is about pain, about death, about finding a compass, an antidote to separability. This is about being ready to go—to befriend death—before we are ready to return home and to live as grown-ups.

But this is not easy because modernity has programmed us not to choose this direction. Even once we decide we want change, we are conditioned to want change to happen quickly and on our own terms—generally, terms that do not jeopardize our perceived entitlements, securities, and self-_resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira. In this context, our visions of change are based on simplistic analyses and solutions, paternalistic relations with marginalized communities and ethnocentric ideals of justice, sustainability, and change. We underestimate the depth and complexity of problems, and we overestimate what information, policies, protocols, and enthusiasm can do. We also miscalculate the gap between where we are at and where we would like to be, and what we would need to relinquish to get there. We tend to project and universalize our expectations of means, outcomes, and outputs, and when different expectations clash, we get upset and frustrated. We do not have the stamina or resilience to keep going when the going gets tough.

We enter debates to “win,” using moral high grounds, self-righteousness, or even self-blame to recenter ourselves in the competition for platform and for the power to (continue to) define the direction of the process. When this happens, the claim of awareness of oppression can become a claim to innocence that recenters the needs, entitlements, and investments of those who are claiming it. Picture a large group of obnoxious children who throw a temper tantrum every time their unrealistic expectations and demands are not met. Now multiply it by a couple of billion. This is us.

We may even say we want to learn from discomfort or from uncertainty, but when it actually happens, when we experience pain and vulnerability, we fight to regain comfort and control. We have been taught to seek consensus and validation and when this is not possible, we become frustrated and don’t know what to do. We tend to overlook the complexities and paradoxes in our contexts, as well as our own contradictions. We tend to polarize, to antagonize, to vilify, to victimize, to idealize, and to romanticize. We tend to look for a moral space beyond critique for ourselves and those with whom we identify. In this context of mistrust, struggle for power, and protection of perceived entitlements, it is difficult to disagree without hurting each other. And since vulnerabilities are not evenly distributed, we should remember that people who are at the receiving end of systemic violence are (again) made responsible for a heavier load of work in spaces where difficult learning happens.

So, where do we go from here? Facing the magnitude of the task of enabling a world without separability (between us and the land, and each other) requires more than a change of narratives, convictions, or identities. It also requires more than a mere intention to change. It requires an interruption of harmful desires hidden behind promises of entitlements and securities that people hold onto, particularly when they are desperate or afraid.

Imagine that separability is a broken limb with pieces of bone left unconnected for a long time, topped with an infected wound. Imagine that in order to heal it, instead of rejoining the bones we simply put a Band-Aid on the wound and a cast around the limb, and we take powerful sedatives to get rid of the pain. Imagine the Band-Aids are colorful, hopeful, and make us feel like everything is going to be okay. The plaster cast makes the limb look functional: it is culturally sensitive, artistically crafted, and signed by everyone to give us the warm feeling of community and care. The sedative numbing the acute chronic pain helps us to escape into the bliss of avoidance, denial, and delirious and delicious distractions. But none of this offers the healing necessary to reconnect the bones.

Genuine rehabilitation would require something completely different. First, we would need to cut the cast open to expose what is hidden underneath. We would then need to rip off the Band-Aids with the mess of glue, hair, and pus; cut away the rotten flesh to stop the infection; and disinfect the wound. Next, we would need to saw the tips of each bone to remove any calcification so that they can be joined together again. Lastly, which is perhaps the most difficult part, we would need to withdraw safely from the numbing sedatives we have become addicted to. No wonder this is a difficult sell, but do we really have any other option? If we don’t heal the limb properly, the infection will compromise the whole metabolism.

This chapter offers frameworks and _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira used in the GTDF collective that articulate both the necessity and the difficulties of this healing work: of both hospicing modernity and holding space for something new, undefined, and potentially—but not necessarily—wiser.

The Eye of the Storm

There is a difference between _divesting_ from modernity and _disinvesting_ from it.[^1] Divestment means that, in order to avoid being implicated in the harms of modernity, you turn your back to modernity and attempt to exit from it. Divestment is practically impossible, and to the extent that it is a viable option for people, it is usually only those who are systemically advantaged by modernity and thus have the choices and resources to seemingly opt out of certain dimensions of the modern system. Compared to divestment, which seeks to transcend modernity without giving up any of its promises, disinvestment means we do not invest in the future of modernity, while staying with modernity’s troubles, facing our responsibilities, and gradually developing discernment to reorient our desires away from modernity’s violence and unsustainability—without resorting to heroism or escapism. One image used in the GTDF collective to sit with the complexities of disinvestment is called “the eye of the storm.”

Imagine a storm between the ways of knowing and being that are dying (within and around us) and those that are being born. On the one hand, there is the work of offering palliative care to assist with what is dying (i.e., hospicing). On the other hand, there is the work of assisting with the birth of something new, without suffocating it with projections (i.e., assisting with midwifery). In between death and birth, in the eye of the storm, we need to keep balance-in-movement, moving with the storm herself: if we walk too fast, we get caught in the vortex; if we walk too slow, we also get caught in the vortex.

Hospicing involves _intellectual accountability and existential surrender._ Assisting with midwifery involves _existential accountability and intellectual surrender._ Intellectual accountability is about facing the truth behind our denials and projections; sitting with our complicity in harm; shedding arrogance and accepting accountability without seeking recognition, redemption, innocence, or purity. Existential surrender is about interrupting addictions and business as usual, confronting fragilities, learning to compost personal and collective shit, and relinquishing colonial entitlements. Existential accountability is about staying present to what is real and painful, centering the living metabolism, integrating medicines, and choosing to grow up. Intellectual surrender is about discernment, learning to let go, tapping collective exiled capacities, developing metabolic literacies, dissolving individuality and separability, and enabling a bio-intelligence to guide us. Intellectual surrender is not about surrendering the intellect, but about surrendering the imprints of colonialism that frame our interpretations of reality so that the land can dream through us.[^2] This requires us to use our intellect to exercise discernment and stay vigilant against fantasies, projections, and distractions.

In disinvesting from modernity, all four dimensions of hospicing and midwifery involve the decolonization of our unconscious, which is an ongoing process and not merely a stated commitment or a single event. This process is extremely difficult and involves many false starts and failed attempts, because it is completely counterintuitive within modernity itself—there are no incentives or rewards for doing it. The following list, which is an adaptation of Suely Rolnik’s[^3] work, is an example of steps that could support this process in relation to existential surrender. For those who undertake this work, it would be important to develop and discern what might be needed for the other three dimensions of hospicing and midwifery as well:

1. Activate your vital compass: reactivate the body as a knowing entity that receives and experiences the world as continuous with itself in its living condition and that is affected by the forces of the world in both mediated and unmediated ways.
2. Practice removing the filters and fantasies that give you a sense of control and that block the ways you are directly affected by the world in order to register world-interpolations that are already occurring.
3. Do not interpret the resulting vulnerability and its discomfort as a bad thing and do not cast interpretations onto this state of instability. These interpretations usually come from premature responses of a threatened ego provoked by its helplessness; failures; and fears of demotion, rejection, social exclusion, and humiliation.
4. Allow what is agonizing within you to die without trying to rescue the old state and its sensation of familiarity, coherence, and stability—remember that the wider metabolism needs this space being cleared by the death of the old in order to strengthen its tether to you.
5. Stay in this state of uncomfortable instability until the creative imagination can articulate the contours of the new entity that is gestating as a result of this encounter with the world. Do not impose limits on the time that the creative imagination needs to support the gestation of the new entity. Do not turn the creative imagination into “creativity” ready for co-optation, consumption, and reproduction of the status quo.
6. Hold on to the life-affirming yearning that keeps life open to being “fertilized” by the world and its difference and endless differentiation. Do not negotiate with what obstructs the possibility of life regenerating itself. Calibrate thinking toward its best behavior: to reimagine its view of the world every time life demands that it do so.

Modernity’s colonization of our unconscious means that, if left with a choice, most people will gravitate toward what is easier, most comfortable, and most familiar, toward what will fulfill their modern desires and temporarily address their sense of depletion. The possibility of emptying ourselves of these desires, of letting both our securities and insecurities go, is only viable when everything else fails, or when we grow bored with our own delusions.

Pause. Check your bus. Do a tally. How many passengers are already prepared to let go and face the end of the world as they know it? How many are getting ready to start the work? How many passengers on your bus are holding on to modernity for dear life and opposing any work in this direction? You just need 51% of your bus on board to work in the eye of the storm.

Walking on a Tightrope

The end of the world as we know it is not necessarily the end of the world. We can think about it instead as the end of a harmful habit of being, which has become untenable. Dougald Hine, a founder of the Dark Mountain Project,[^4] talks about it as the negotiation of the surrender of a violent mode of existence, which involves disentangling ourselves from the harmful stories and deeds of civilization.[^5] He proposes four things that might be worth doing in a time of endings:

1. saving things that are worth saving and can be saved;
2. mourning the good things that must be left behind, and bringing their stories with us;
3. noticing the things that have been highly valued but that no longer serve us and we should walk away from; and
4. remembering that what is ending was once the beginning of something else that ended prior to it, and looking for the lessons needing to be learned about that transition from our current vantage point.

Facing the end of the world as we know it and engaging with the type of inquiry proposed by Dougald are much more challenging tasks than they seem. They require discernment and deftly navigating around the potential pitfalls involved in this work. In the GTDF collective, we illustrate the difficulties and perils of this process through the image of walking on a tightrope.

Imagine that the tightrope is placed over a precarious net of desperate hope, which hangs over an abyss of desperate hopelessness. Desperate hope is hope that modernity can be rescued by the right ideology; a heroic authority; the chosen people; an extraordinary practice; or a messianic return to where the good, the true, and the beautiful have not been corrupted. Desperate hopelessness spells nihilism, misanthropy, hedonism, absolute relativism (whatever-ism), and the banalization of brutality.

Balance on a tightrope is not easy to achieve because of its oscillations, and lack of predictability and absolute certainties. Staying still for a long time is also not an option; you need to move. On this tightrope in particular, you must walk with honesty, humility, humor, and hyper–self-reflexivity in order not to fall from it. Walking with honesty is about choosing reality over fantasy in facing the shadows, the storms, and the shit. Walking with humility is about de-idealizing humanity so that we can see it in its full complexity: the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, the broken, and the messed up—within ourselves and around us. Walking with humor is about disinvesting from economies of sternness and superiority, keeping all the absurdities in view, and being able to laugh at ourselves and with others as we start to see that we are cute and pathetic characters in this cosmic plot. Walking with hyper–self-reflexivity is what can help us to develop discernment, remain sober, choose maturity, and manifest responsibility before will. As you walk the tightrope, you carry a rod in your hands to help you balance. This rod has intellectual rigor on one side and relational rigor on the other. Steadiness and stability should help you to start to develop relationships grounded on trust, respect, reciprocity, consent, and accountability.

We have also reimagined this process using a different metaphor: that of watching a train wreck in slow motion. Usually when we evoke this image, people imagine watching the wreck from a relatively safe place outside the train. However, we can also watch a train wreck in slow motion from inside the train. If we juxtapose the two _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira (of the tightrope and the train) there would be train wagons (railcars) of hope, where people know about the problem and are praying for a miracle; wagons of hopelessness, where people wish to speed up the process so that we can get it over with; and many wagons of denial. To assess the reality of the situation, you may need to bypass, trick, or bribe the guards to climb to the top of one of the wagons where you can see both the train and its surroundings. On the roof of the train, there will be several forces working against you, including the slippery surface, the speed and draft of the train, and the quality of the tracks—as well as tunnels that will require you to duck. There will also be contextual challenges dependent on seasons and weather. But if you can manage to navigate these forces and find balance in movement atop the train, from that vantage point you may be able to assess the existing damage and the trajectory of impact. You may, to some extent, be able to evaluate how people could soften the crash. You may also be able to see where in the landscape it could be relatively safer for people to jump off the train, if that option becomes available. Then you would need to decide how and with whom to share this information.

---

## Exercise

Pause. Check your bus. Locate your passengers on the train. To what wagons have they bought tickets? Are your passengers enjoying the ride? Do they know where this train is going? Is it important for them to know? How many are aware of the tragedy unfolding? How many are in denial? Are there any passengers who want to climb to the roof? Are there passengers trying to overtake the engine to stop or redirect the train? How many passengers are motivated to walk on a tightrope with honesty, humility, humor, and hyper–self-reflexivity? Do they really know what they are getting themselves into?

Composting Shit

Throughout this text, I have offered you various frameworks, acronyms, metaphors, and stories to orient and support you if you choose the path of disinvestment from modernity, in the various dimensions of this work. The following acronym, COMPOST, offers a list of minimum requirements of capacities, practices, and dispositions you might need to develop in order to do the kind of work described in this chapter: to face storms, walk on tightropes, and climb to the roof of ill-fated trains at the end of the world as we know it.

**C**apacity for holding space: for painful and difficult things that are irritating and overwhelming, without being immobilized or wanting to be coddled or rescued;

**O**wning up to one’s complicity and implication in harm: the harms of violence and unsustainability required to create and maintain the world as we know it with the pleasures, certainties, and securities we enjoy;

**M**aturity to interrupt self-infantilization, to face and work on individual and collective shit, rather than denying or dumping it onto others or spreading it around;

**P**ause of narcissistic, hedonistic and “fixing” compulsions: in order to identify, interrupt, and disinvest from harmful desires, entitlements, projections, fantasies, and idealizations;

**O**thering our self-_resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira and self-narratives: in order to encounter the “self beyond the self,” including the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, the broken, and the messed up in everything and everyone;

**S**tamina and sobriety to show up differently: to do what is needed rather than what is pleasurable, easy, comfortable, consumable, or convenient;

**T**urning toward unlimited responsibility with compassion, serenity, openness, solidarity, mutuality; and without investments in purity, protagonism, progress, and popularity.

The key component of any practice of composting is decaying organic material, or shit. But very few people really enjoy dealing with it, which is why we also mapped 101 ways of avoiding dealing with our individual and collective shit.[^6] When shit happens, we tend to think it is someone else’s responsibility—that we are just innocent bystanders who are not connected to it in any way. We externalize blame and repress our own shit in order to protect our self-_resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira. However, if we are nested in a wider metabolism, this is not a responsible, sober, or mature thing to do. There is no “away.” Facing the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, the broken, and the messed up of humanity within and around us is the first step in preparing for when things start to fall apart.[^7] Another important step in this preparatory work is recognizing that this path will not be easy or linear, and it will inevitably involve many mistakes and failures along the way.

The Gifts of Failure

We chose the word _gesture_ for the title of the GTDF _(Gesturing_ Towards Decolonial Futures) collective to underscore the fact that decolonization is impossible when our livelihoods are underwritten by colonial violence and unsustainability. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, our health systems and social security, and the technologies that allow us to read and write about this are all subsidized by expropriation, dispossession, destitution, genocides, and ecocides. There is no way around it: we cannot bypass the difficult work that must be done in order to hospice modernity and midwife something different. Therefore, we understand that our decolonial gestures and attempts to undertake this work will undoubtedly and inevitably fail. However, how we fail is important. It is actually in the moments of failure that the deepest (un)learning becomes possible and we can get a glimpse of the depth of our collective predicament.

Failing generatively requires both intellectual and relational rigor. Facing failure with honesty, humility, hyper–self-reflexivity, and humor is not easy, but it is a practice that GTDF is trying to develop. The first step in this direction is to expand our capacity and disposition to hold space for difficult and painful feedback without feeling overwhelmed, immobilized, or wanting to be rescued from discomfort. Any feedback is good data. In this sense, coddling is a way of betraying one another in this process of (un)learning together. However, in order to receive feedback without becoming defensive, and offer honest feedback without compromising our relationships, we do need containers that enable us to engage with failure with honesty, humility, humor, and hyper–self-reflexivity.

GTDF has developed a protocol for internal peer review that recognizes the gifts of our failures, and reminds us that we need to face responsibility for addressing the harm we may have inflicted upon others, and for being taught by those failures so that we do not repeat them. This protocol consists of a list of ten “potholes” in the road toward decolonization that we have mapped over the years, and a list of ten hyper–self-reflexivity questions. You are welcome to use this protocol as a way to reflect on, or start conversations about the inevitable failures of gestures toward decolonial futures and of tentative efforts to hospice modernity.

### Potholes in the Road toward Decolonization (For People in Low-Intensity Struggle)

**Having a critique of colonialism means that you are already decolonized.**

Saying you are doing it does not mean you are actually doing it.

**Seeing all resistance to authority as anticolonial.**

Many forms of resistance are inherently colonial or imperial.

**Celebrating all attempts to disrupt colonial patterns as contributing to decolonization.**

Most attempts to disrupt colonialism are still grounded in colonial entitlements.

**Extracting, selectively consuming, and misinterpreting Indigenous teachings (and teachings from other cultures).**

The perceived entitlement to access and mastery of other(ed) knowledges is a colonial entitlement.

**Imagining entanglement as interconnection with beauty only.**

Rather than seeing entanglement as entanglement with shit as well.

**Emphasizing entitlements and forgetting accountabilities.**

Attempting to transcend privilege without giving anything up.

**Expecting other people (especially Indigenous and racialized people) to shoulder the costs of your learning.**

Attempting to decolonize without considering the burdens you place on other people.

**Confusing self-actualization with decolonization.**

Seeing individual free/creative self-expression as a decolonial gesture.

**Erasing distinctions between high- and low-intensity struggles.**

Positioning yourself on the basis of individual choice rather than structural location. Flattening uneven struggles.

**Assuming that because you are a victim of systemic oppression you cannot be complicit in harm.**

No one is off the hook, ever.

### Hyper–Self-Reflexivity Questions

1. To what extent are you reproducing what you critique?
2. To what extent are you avoiding looking at your own complicities and denials, and at whose expense? How do you face responsibility for the ways the current system grants you unearned advantages?
3. How might your work require the labor of Black, Indigenous, or racialized people; or resources that could have been redistributed to Black, Indigenous, or racialized communities or individuals? Given this, what are your responsibilities in relation to these communities?
4. What are you doing this for? Who are you accountable to? What is your theory of change? What would you like your work to move in the world?
5. Who is your imagined audience? What do you expect from this audience? What compromises have you had to make in order for your work to be intelligible and relatable to this audience? To what extent can these compromises compromise the work itself? Who are you choosing not to upset and why?
6. To what extent are you aware of how you are being read by communities of high-intensity struggle? Who (in these communities) would legitimately roll their eyes at what you are doing (i.e., find it indulgent, self-serving, self-congratulatory, or self-infantilizing)?
7. Who or what is this really about? How does integrity manifest in your work?
8. To what extent is the politics you are proposing based on the modern grammar of exceptionalism, entitlements, and exaltedness that characterize political engagements within modernity?
9. How wide is the gap between where you think you are at and where you are actually at? Who would be able to help you realize that? Would you be able to listen? To what extent can you respond with humility, honesty, humor, and hyper–self-reflexivity when your work or self-image is challenged?
10. What would you have to give up or let go of in order to go deeper?

Rescue Boat

The work presented in this book is not the kind of work that tells people what to think or what to do. In this sense, this work won’t be useful, or won’t be useful in the same way, for everyone. People often ask the GTDF collective why we do not scale up the work to reach and convince more people. Those who ask the question probably find the work useful and generalize its relevance. Many who ask the question also want us to simplify the message so that “everyone” can understand. They say that the complicated language can be an access barrier for people and can be seen and felt as elitist. While we agree to a point that more accessibility is necessary, the labor of translating complex ideas and practices into accessible pedagogies with integrity and accountability is particularly slow and extremely difficult.

We use a metaphor as a response to the suggestion to scale up the work. We usually say that we do not intend to be a commercial ship (harvesting or transporting consumer goods), or a cruise liner (taking tourists around), or a battleship (ready to fight an ideological or cultural war), or a pirate ship (aiming to attack and take over other ships), or a spy submarine (analyzing the weaknesses of enemies). We say we are more like a small rescue and cleanup boat with some unconventional equipment. Although we are constantly building and testing new tools, we do not have the equipment for all weather conditions or the capacity to respond to every type of distress signal. We might be able to help those who are treading water or facing the prospect of a shipwreck only in certain circumstances. That is why we do not see what we do as universally relevant or applicable and that is why scaling up is not an intentional goal.

Next Steps

If you have made it this far, you know that this book must not have a simple or easy ending, because we cannot read or write ourselves out of modernity. Thus, rather than offering you closure and comfort through a conventional conclusion, I will leave you with something to keep you company. I invite you to activate senses and sensibilities that can enable you to experience metabolic intimacies, using the text below as a compass.

[^2]:  As a sign of respect for the Indigenous relations I work with in multiple contexts, I try to be extremely careful when it comes to positioning myself as an Indigenous person. I generally identify only as an Indigenous descendant in order not to impose any claim to voice, space, or territory in contexts of Indigenous struggle. The politics of claims to Indigeneity are different in different geopolitical contexts. In North America, identifying myself as Indigenous in other Indigenous people’s territories can be perceived as attempting to claim power or privileges in ways that are illegitimate to the Indigenous people of that context. In many contexts, particularly in Latin America, Indigeneity is not something one claims: you need to be claimed by Indigenous peoples and communities, it is not one’s choice. Learning to adapt to different (and changing) expectations in cross-cultural contexts is a lifelong process. In the Latin American context, for example, my hesitation to identify as an Indigenous person (i.e., me trying to be respectful toward the communities I worked with) was often perceived by my Indigenous relations as an offense—I was read as being ashamed of my background, which was definitely not what I felt or intended to communicate. I am still learning to navigate these complexities with accountability and intellectual and relational rigor.

Part 1: Warm-up/Prep Work

Warm-up: Into the Future

[^1]:  It is important to acknowledge that _resources/books//Hospicing Modernity_ Facing Humanity's Wro - Vanessa Machado De Oliveira of apocalyptic futures have been used by people across the political spectrum, including the far right, to mobilize different kinds of collective action. It is also useful to acknowledge that within modernity we are expected to trust a positive image of the future; therefore, people who believe in this premise may argue that bringing up the potential of a catastrophic future leads to alienation, immobilization, indulgent and irresponsible behavior, and the reproduction of a nonrelational ethics. This book argues otherwise.

[^13]:  I borrow the term _adjacent possible_ from Stuart Kauffman, but my use of the term is based on a critique of the limits of modernity, while his use is grounded on interactions in science and mathematics. He first mentioned the term in a paper about the nature of autonomous agents and the worlds they mutually create in 1996. Paulo Freire has also used a similar term _(“inédito viável”_) to refer to what is viable but currently unthinkable in a context informed by liberation theology and Marxist ideas that is also different from where I am located.

[^14]:  _Radical Tenderness_ is a term that Dani d’Emilia first encountered while working as part of the transnational performance collective La Pocha Nostra (2009–2016).

[^16]:  The term _co-sense_ is used by different artistic and activist movements with different connotations. The work of Caro Novella with Quimera Rosa introduces an important contrast between consenting and co-sensing that enlarges the field of intimacies beyond human interactions, which resonates with Indigenous ancestral teachings from communities in our network, whose practices inspire our text.

[^17]:  “Co-sensing with Radical Tenderness” is a text Dani d’Emilia and I began to write in 2018. The text is now available in multiple formats. It can be found as a mini-book designed by Laura Daviña and available from Publication Studios at http://lapubli.online/RadicalTenderness.html]]; it can also be found as a deck of cards available at [https://decolonialfutures.net/radicaltenderness](https://decolonialfutures.net/radicaltenderness\).

# Acknowledgments

I express my deepest gratitude to the Musqueam people who are the traditional and ancestral custodians of the lands where I live and work.

I am really grateful for my family. I believe I have frustrated every single one of my parents’ expectations, projections, and anticipations. I believe they only stopped worrying about me when my children—their grandchildren, grew up to be incredibly resilient and responsible young adults, despite—or perhaps because of—all the challenges we faced as racialized immigrants moving between multiple countries. If anything, that, unquestionably, in my parents’ eyes, was my greatest achievement. Beyond the ties of blood, I am also extremely grateful to the family that I have been gifted: you are my lifeline. I thank my nonhuman family, the planet-metabolism itself for the opportunity to do this work, and for all the teachings, the challenges, the medicines, and the gifts that have been sent our way.

I feel really lucky and grateful to have an incredible intellectual and artistic community around me. This community involves those in the Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures (GTDF) collective, the Teia das 5 Curas network, and the youth collective (that keeps changing its name). The ideas, stories, invitations, tools, and practices presented in this book have been developed through or inspired by their existence. I feel deeply indebted to Indigenous relations for their political, existential, and ceremonial teachings, and for correcting me when necessary. I would like to thank Maria Jara Qquerar, Ninawa Huni Kui, Elwood Jimmy, Cash Ahenakew and Mabel Rowe, Keith Chiefmoon, Karen Russel, Leroy Hunt, Anne Catface and Sandra Manyfeathers, John Crier, Pajé Barbosa, Nadia, Rosa, Benicio and Gorô Pitaguary, Adriana and Mateus Tremembere, Fakho and Yoran Fulni-ô, Ubiracy Patacho, Dani Pigeau, Carl Mika, Garrick Cooper, Bronwyn Thurlow, Noemi Condori, and Carmen Ramos, among many others.… I would like to thank the artists and curators who have given life and body-wisdom to GTDF: Elwood Jimmy, Dani d’Emilia, Haruko Okano, Azul (Carolina Duque), Kyra Fay, Sonali Sangeeta Balajee, Mo Fletcher, Rachel Derrah, Harikoa Bronsdaughter-George, and Jyotsna Liyanaratne. I thank our translation and theory ninja-team of people who work tirelessly to do what is needed in relation to design, writing, organization, and coordination (including funding proposals, articles, chapters, books, seminars, workshops, concerts, courses, and more): Sharon Stein, Rene Susa, Shawn Van Sluys, Camilla Cardoso, Dino Siwek, Sarah Amsler, Will Valley, Tereza Cajkova, Ben Lickerman, Jocelyn Yerxa, Steeven Pedneaut, Renato Pereira, Agnieszka Bulacik, Ali Sutherland, Raphael Daibert, and Jeff Sha. I thank our “learning to breathe water” collaborators: Lynn Mario de Souza, Bill Calhoun, Tania Ramalho, and Lisa Taylor.

I am immensely grateful to the Musagetes Foundation, especially Shawn Van Sluys, Joy Roberts, Douglas McMullen, and Yeti Agnew for the continuous support for and personal engagement with this work. I would also like to thank Michael Barnstijn and Louise MacCallum for their generosity and vision. I am also grateful for the support of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for funding the research project “Ethical Social Innovations for Decolonial Futures” that created a platform for the GTDF collective.

I would also like to say thank you to those who are involved with social initiatives that have interfaced with GTDF and opened opportunities for mutual learning: Manish Jain, Udi Mandel, Kelly Teamey, Gerardo Lópes Amaro, and Kate Morales (Ecoversities); Alessandra Pomarico and Niko Oleynikov (Free Home University); Dougald Hine (School Called Home); Felix Marquardt (Black Elephant); Bayo Akomolafe and Nuno da Silva (Emergence network); Jem Bendell and Katie Carr (Deep Adaptation); Maikoiyo Anabi Alley-Barnes (Black Constellation); Stephanie Sobek-Swant and Mackenzie Lespérance/Smiling Water (Rare Sites); Vicki Robin (Post-Carbon Institute); Katie Teague (As Temperatures Rise); Joana Costa, La Salete Coelho, and Jorge Cardoso (Sinergias); Adam Cajkova, Kristyna Hrunanova, and Eva Malirova (NaZemi); Valentina Desideri (PAF); Zuzana Labasova (Zivica); Frances Westley, Tim Broadhead, and Dan McCarthy (Getting to Maybe); Clive Belgeonne and Rob Unwin (DECSY); Dina Bataineh (Taghmees Kitchen); Karim-Yassin Goessinger (CILAS); Timo Holthoff and Sonja Salminen (Bridge project); Christine Gibson (Healing Centre Cooperative); Xana Piteira and Ana Marreiro; and the OpEd project team.

The completion of this book would not have been possible without the editorial support of Rene Susa, Sharon Stein, Shawn van Sluys, Dan McCarthy, Will Valley, Vicki Robin, Martin Shaw, and Dougald Hine. I would also like to thank Carolina Duque, Tereza Cajkova, Dani d’Emilia, Haruko Okano, Sarah Amsler, Bill Sutherland, Felix Marquardt, Tania Ramalho, and Ben Lickerman for extremely useful comments and suggestions.

I am also grateful for the committed scholarship of fellow academics who often have to risk their careers and their health when they challenge harmful assumptions that are normalized in modern institutions. I honor their scholarship, but I am also aware that I mobilize it selectively. I have chosen certain concepts and arguments and rearranged them in creative translations that may bear no resemblance to their original use or intention. I cannot apologize for that, but I do apologize in advance for misinterpretations and misrepresentations. Since this book invites the interruption of the modern desire for canonization and canonical legacy, I list the scholars who have most influenced this work here. I only refer specifically to their work in the text or through endnote citations in the book when absolutely necessary.

**Vanessa Machado de Oliveira Andreotti** is a Latinx professor at the University of British Columbia. She holds a Canada Research Chair in Race, Inequalities, and Global Change.

Vanessa started working in the area of global learning as a school teacher in Brazil in 1994. She has led educational and research programs in various countries, including the UK, Finland, Aotearoa/New Zealand, Brazil, and Canada.

She has extensive experience working across sectors internationally in international and comparative education, particularly in areas related to global justice, global citizenship, Indigenous and community engagement, sustainability, and social and ecological responsibility. Drawing on different critiques of colonialism and human exceptionalism, her research examines the interface between historical, systemic, and ongoing forms of violence; and the material and relational dimensions of unsustainability within modernity. Vanessa is one of the founding members of the Gesturing Towards Decolonial Futures (GTDF) collective (decolonialfutures.net]]) and Teia das 5 Curas, an international network of Indigenous communities located mostly in Canada and Latin America.

She is currently directing research projects and learning initiatives in collaboration with Indigenous communities in Canada and Latin America related to global healing and well-being in times of unprecedented challenges.

Drawing on her mixed family history and the work of her arts/research/ecology collective, Vanessa invites us to develop the stamina to face difficult and painful things together with more maturity, sobriety, discernment, and accountability and to learn to activate senses and sensibilities that have been exiled by modernity and that can help us to sense, relate, and imagine otherwise.
