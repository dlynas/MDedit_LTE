# Preface

> The campaign just becomes a bunch of questions you have to answer.
> 
> And once you’ve answered the questions, you have to follow through on that answer.
> 
> —ROBBY MOOK, CAMPAIGN MANAGER, HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT, 20161

**E**ven though we have experienced an election in 2016 where the rules supposedly did not apply, anyone who hopes to pursue a career in politics—or just be a good citizen—should be familiar with some basics about the electorate and the mechanics of election campaigns. Although energy, hard work, creativity, and political instinct cannot be taught, there are specific skills that are crucial in modern campaigns. This book will teach you how to understand the fundamental factors that drive elections in America and to learn some of the skills employed by political professionals.

The goal of this book is to go beyond the spin and hyperbole of many election commentators about a particular contest. The goal is to help you understand how voters decide and how strategists persuade and to give you some of the technical skills to get an interesting job with a campaign. The book combines the insights of campaign professionals with insight from the study of previous campaigns and scholarly research. It combines theory, practice, and exploration, taking the insights of political scientists and political practitioners and rolling them into one.

This book seeks to reveal what really happens inside American political campaigns and to unpeel some myths. During each election season, the contemporary political media tends to hype the latest new campaign technologies and tactics as revolutionary game changers and election winners. In fact, they rarely are. Layered on top of this is the near-single-minded focus among scholars and journalists on presidential elections, a focus that tends to obscure the realities of nonpresidential election contests and the effects that campaigns can have on election results.

To gain a broader understanding of American campaigns, we interviewed more than 140 campaign managers and political professionals using a combination of in-depth conversations and structured questionnaires. Using insights from our research and our own experiences covering, studying, and doing campaigns, this book takes the reader on a tour of modern election campaigns as seen through the eyes of the women and men who run them. “A Textbook on Managing Campaigns, by the Managers Themselves” is how the _New York Times_ headlined a 2014 article about our research and writing.2 This book shows when, how, and why campaigns matter, using the experiences and the words of campaign managers themselves to shed new light on why this distinctly American political process, warts and all, is still the best demonstration of democracy in action.

The second edition of _Inside Campaigns_ appears on the heels of a 2016 election in which campaign managers loomed large. Rarely has the media paid such rapt attention to campaign managers as it paid to Donald Trump’s as he cycled through multiple managers, each of them high-profile and scandal-plagued, and multiple organizational setups.

It is also hard to recall a presidential election season in which the major campaigns took such sharply contrasting management approaches: there was the highly organized corporate structure of Clinton, the nimble grassroots Bernie Sanders campaign, and the candidate-in-charge campaign of CEO and populist conservative firebrand Trump. The feting and tearing down of campaign managers continued into 2017. When Senate candidate Doug Jones gave his victory speech after winning a special election and becoming the first Democrat to win a statewide race in Alabama in more than two decades, for example, three of the first people he thanked were campaign aides, and Jones predicted that his campaign manager Joe Trippi would go down in the annals of Alabama history. The second edition of this book also appears at a time when some pundits have claimed that Trump’s use of Twitter, cable news, and twenty-first-century bombast has destroyed campaign guardrails and remade how campaigns are won and lost. As our book demonstrates, the claims that Trump has changed how campaigns are waged are vastly overstated, just as similar media claims about Barack Obama’s game-changing 2008 campaign were hyperbolic and largely unpersuasive.

Based on our research, political campaigns are best described as short-term marketing and communications organizations, and this has been true for centuries. As Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager Robby Mook sees it, campaigns come down to asking and answering a series of strategic questions about how their candidate can win more votes than the other candidates. We identify five fundamental strategic questions that are most often asked in campaigns, ranging from “Who are our target voters?” to “What are my opponents and allies doing?”

However, as Mook pointed out, just answering strategic questions is not enough. The campaign manager must follow through and implement the strategy. We’ve found that campaign managers must be able to play at least ten specific roles in order to effectively execute their campaign strategies, whether the campaign is a small local effort or a large national juggernaut like Mook’s. These ten roles provide the structure for our book and open a window onto the nature of the struggle for political power in America. Depending on the circumstances of a particular campaign, some roles will be more critical than others, but none of the ten are unimportant. We begin with a brief historical case study in American campaign management and argue that the job description hasn’t changed that much. This is followed by a chapter presenting a theory of how and why campaigns matter to election outcomes. Then we begin to examine the ten roles of the campaign manager, including chapters such as Political Historian and Data Scientist, Entrepreneur and Chief Financial Officer, Field General, and Candidate Caretaker and Confidant, just to name a few.

Our interviews with campaign managers and other political professionals began in early 2011 and have continued into 2018 and include conversations with senior officials involved in the 2016 presidential campaign. Taken together, these interviews yielded a trove of original research and fresh perspectives on the electoral process in the United States. Our interviewees are as diverse and as politically balanced as we could make them. To provide generational perspective, we interviewed seasoned hands including those who began their careers in the 1970s and 1980s as well as the most recent class of managers and strategists who worked in the 2014 and 2016 election cycles. Some of our interviewees—James Carville, Clinton, 1992; David Axelrod, Obama, 2008, 2012; Ken Mehlman, Bush, 2000, 2004; Sally Bradshaw, Bush, 2016; Robby Mook, Clinton, 2016—are among the most recognizable political names in the country. Others featured in this book—for example, Jen Pihlaja, Kelly Evans, Jarryd Gonzales, Jay Howser—are less well-known, but they have had key roles in helping many of America’s most influential members of Congress, governors, mayors, and state and local officials win, or sometimes lose, their elections.

We have thousands of pages of transcribed interviews to date. In them, managers and political professionals offer remarkably candid insights about their experiences working in and running campaigns. To a degree not typically seen in political news reporting, they generously share the personal joys and disappointments of their political lives. We are sorry we could not tell all of their fascinatingly colorful stories in these pages.

Based on our conversations, _Inside Campaigns: Elections through the Eyes of Political Professionals_ describes the complex ways in which campaigns can affect election results and, more broadly, how campaigns shape the struggle to win power in American democracy. Although much scholarly literature on campaigns is focused on a single presidential election or relies on quantitative data to explore the impact of campaign activities on election outcomes, _Inside Campaigns_ takes a holistic look through the managers’ perspectives as to when, how, and why campaigns and the people running these multimillion-dollar operations seek to affect, and often do influence, election outcomes.

A great many academics dispute the idea that campaigns can influence election outcomes. These scholars assume that underlying factors either favor a candidate or they do not favor a candidate and that no amount of campaign spending or brilliant strategy or campaign tactics can change the likely outcome. The scholarly skepticism also rests on the argument that even if campaign tactics had the potential to change entrenched minds and outweigh the nature of the times, there would need to be measurable differences in the impact of the competing campaigns. And the overwhelming conventional wisdom among political scientists is simply that such differences rarely exist in competitive US races. In short, in the view of many scholars, campaigns either don’t matter because they’re dwarfed by the political “fundamentals” or opposing campaigns simply cancel each other out.

None of the campaign managers we talked with would argue that campaigns are always decisive or can turn a sure loser into a winner, but they would also not agree with these arguments. In American political campaigns, the margin—1, 2, or 3 percentage points—can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Our research leads us to believe that campaigns and the people who run them have the power to influence, in small but potentially decisive ways, the direction of an election. There is no one formula—no single play, magic message bullet, or technical wizardry—that guarantees victory. That said, in close races, campaign strategies and day-to-day tactical decision making can matter at the margin, and even a small effect can mean all the difference in the world when it comes to election outcomes.

Ultimately, our research reveals that campaigns continue to be more about the power of personal engagement, mobilization, and persuasion than about technique or technology. Of course, even the most engaging and persuasive campaign will bump up against and be constrained by the fundamental structure of the election, and campaign managers understand the limits on what they can accomplish. But campaign outcomes are not foreordained and winners are not predestined. The campaigns that can target the right voters, find the most effective ways to reach them, develop persuasive messages, and adjust their tactics and strategies according to how they are faring and what their allies and opponents are doing are going to gain an advantage that is in many instances decisive. Campaign managers who can answer the key strategic questions and who have the management skills to execute their strategies can, and often do, increase their candidate’s share of the vote.

David Axelrod told us that the most successful campaign managers and staffers strongly share their candidate’s policy positions. Unsurprisingly, the Democrats and Republicans we interviewed had very different perspectives on issues. But we found that Democratic and Republican campaign professionals do share a surprisingly strong consensus on how campaigns work and on how they should be run. Seasoned Democrats are more likely to have moved up through voter contact or field operations whereas Republicans are somewhat more likely to have press relations or communications backgrounds, although this difference doesn’t seem to color their opinions about how to win an election. Our conversations reveal a nonpartisan, shared political language, and we hope that our readers, regardless of their own partisanship, can learn equally from the Democrats and Republicans we’ve interviewed.

We often heard that working on campaigns is the only way to learn how campaigns really work, although we hope that this book conveys some of that knowledge to our readers. Most political pros told us they started out with volunteer or part-time jobs while in high school, in college, or shortly after graduating. This was certainly the career path for David Plouffe, President Obama’s campaign manager in 2008. Plouffe began working on campaigns at twenty-one, with little academic preparation. By forty, he had worked on dozens of them and had developed a wide-ranging skill set that allowed him to direct one of the most unlikely presidential campaigns in history. A similar story describes Karl Rove, the architect of George W. Bush’s election in 2000 and reelection in 2004.

Our interviews end by asking “What advice would you give to a young person who’s thinking about getting involved in politics?” Of everyone we’ve talked to, only one said “Don’t!” But politics is not for everybody, observed James Carville, noting that many college graduates simply aren’t cut out for weeks of unglamorous entry-level grunt work at little or no pay: “They should go get a job in some senator’s office,” he dismissively advised.3 For those young people who can do the work, electoral politics can provide a very fast track for twenty-somethings to gain experience and responsibility. “Five years with a company gives you one line on your resume. Five years in the campaign realm gives you several,” said Dan Centinello, who managed Chris Christie’s 2009 gubernatorial campaign.4 Although a book cannot teach someone to be a winning campaign manager, we believe that this book will let the reader, young or not so young, better understand what campaigns do and why they matter, and perhaps interest them in working in a campaign or advocating for a cause. If our readers do decide to get involved, we hope _Inside Campaigns: Elections through the Eyes of Political Professionals_ makes them more informed students and consumers of civic life and enables them to make a more valuable contribution to our democratic process.

# Acknowledgments

**T**his book is the result of a unique collaboration between a small band of academic researchers and more than 140 political professionals who have been willing to share what they’ve learned while working inside campaigns. Since 2011, the Campaign Manager Survey under the direction of Melissa Sharp has produced thousands of transcribed pages describing the backgrounds, decision-making processes, and insights of American political managers. Joining Melissa on the second edition research team were Andrea Koslow, an adjunct professor at Georgetown and American Universities, and John Jay, a former student of coauthors Goldstein and Dallek. We deeply thank Melissa, Andrea, and John for their diligent work and patience with the authors.

We are also indebted to Dr. Lara Brown, Director of George Washington University’s Graduate School of Political Management (GSPM), and other faculty and staff including Sarah Gunel, Kay Martinez, and John Brandt for giving Matthew Dallek the time, moral support, and encouragement to work on this book. Dallek’s students at GSPM, a school devoted to teaching students applied political skills, were a continuing source of inspiration as they embarked on careers in public service and political leadership.

Robin Roberts, founder of the Washington Media Scholars Foundation college scholarship program, generously provided office services and staff assistance to the authors and our research team. We are very grateful to Robin and the Washington Media Scholars Foundation for their support.

The support of the University of San Francisco and its Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good for building a program in DC that blends theory and practice has made it possible for Goldstein to work on this project and to learn and teach how campaigns and American democracy work. College of Arts and Science Dean Marcelo Camperi and McCarthy Center Director David Donahue have provided great support and guidance in building the program. Students in Goldstein’s USF in DC program and in his UCDC Campaigns and Elections class provided great feedback on the material and inspiration to continue the project over the last five years. Goldstein would also like to thank Sofia Greco-Byrne from USF and Alex Kubie from the University of Michigan for providing excellent research assistance in tracking down and analyzing 2016 election data.

At CQ Press/SAGE, we have appreciated the support and guidance of Charrise Kino, Executive Director of College Publishing at SAGE, over the past few years. Among her many accomplishments, few could be better than hiring Monica Eckman to be Executive Publisher at CQ Press. Monica is a real pro, and we appreciate her energy, insight, and deadlines as we worked on the second edition. If they had chosen a different path, we are confident that Charrise and Monica would have been top-notch campaign managers and would have fulfilled all the roles we outline in the book! We benefited from the ruthless efficiency of Copy Editor Mark Bast and Production Editor Andrew Olson. Karine Hovsepian gave us a wonderful new cover and fresh art design for the pages of the second edition. Marketing Manager Erica DeLuca and her staff patiently indulged the authors’ ideas. We thank our whole team at SAGE/CQ Press.

Finally, and most importantly, we want to thank all of the political professionals who gave their time, experiences, and insights to this project. Nearly everyone we interviewed enjoyed the process and supported our goal of providing students with a new perspective from inside American political campaigns. Many of those we talked to also provided introductions to other political professionals who were interviewed for the book. Campaign managers are most often comfortable working behind the scenes, so we are particularly indebted to those individuals who were willing to share with students their personal experiences and opinions in print and in their own words. We are also grateful to all those individuals who were interviewed and made a valuable contribution to our research but whose names and insights we were sadly unable to include in our limited pages—we apologize to them. We wish we published everyone’s campaign war stories. We heard a lot of good ones. Thank you for letting us listen.

# 1 Losing and Winning The Craft and Science of Political Campaigns

> There are three people that I want to acknowledge tonight because if it wasn’t for them, we would not be here . . . whenever the history is written about Alabama politics, remember those names, Giles Perkins, Doug Turner and Joe Trippi.
> 
> —Democratic US senator-elect Doug Jones credited his upset victory to his campaign managers in a nationally televised victory speech on the evening of December 12, 2017.1

**P**olitical campaigns are like new restaurants: Most of them will fail. Of the more than 140 campaign managers we interviewed for this book, nearly all had lost elections—and many of them more than once. Even the most experienced and successful campaign manager can lose unexpectedly and even spectacularly.

Consider the case of a campaign manager we will call “TW.” For three decades, he managed his candidate—his client and his best friend—rising from the New York legislature, to the governor’s mansion, and on to the US Senate.2 Along the way, TW had worked for other candidates who were nominated for or won the presidency.3 TW’s skills as a campaign manager had earned him national renown and a very comfortable living. He was the undisputed American political wizard behind the curtain.

Now at the peak of his craft, TW was in Chicago at the Republican Party’s nominating convention. His client of thirty years was the front-runner to win the nomination. TW was so certain of the result that he had sent his candidate out of the country on a preconvention tour of European capitals. The news media and the buzz on the convention floor held that TW’s candidate was assured the nomination. But when the voting finally got under way, TW and his candidate were stunned when they led the first roll call with only 37 percent of the delegates and were forced into a second ballot.4 The aura of inevitability so carefully cultivated with the media and party leaders began to dissipate, and there was no Plan B. On the third ballot, a dark-horse candidate wrested the nomination from TW’s grasp.5 The political wizard was no more.

The dark-horse candidate was Abraham Lincoln, and the year was 1860 (see Figure 1.1]]).6 It was only the second national convention for the Republican Party, and Senator William H. Seward of New York had been expected to emerge with the nomination. Seward’s manager was fellow New Yorker Thurlow Weed, who had earlier worked on the presidential campaigns of William Henry Harrison (1840), Henry Clay (1844), Zachary Taylor (1848), Winfield Scott (1852), and John Charles Fremont (1856).

Weed was a national figure, but even the most successful managers rarely achieve that status. This book is not about celebrity campaign managers and consultants who achieve notoriety on presidential campaigns—although we’ve interviewed a number of those. Instead, we aggregate the insights of a wide swath of people who have run winning and losing races for both parties and at all levels of politics—from the courthouse to the White House.

The managers we heard from share a number of common traits and skills, including the ability to play multiple roles in the pursuit of victory on election day. And, in this book, we examine the many responsibilities, decisions, and experiences that managers can—although don’t always—use to drive the success or failure of campaigns. This is not a how-to handbook but instead the collected insights from scores of political professionals, supplemented with our own knowledge of campaign mechanics and core scholarly findings about the fundamental factors that influence campaigns and elections in America. Through this synthesis, we can gain not only a greater understanding of what managers do and the array of roles they play but also the workings of the most important mechanism in a democracy—free and fair elections.

# A Tale of Two Managers

The science and mechanics of political campaigns have changed since Weed’s heyday. Yet many of Weed’s skills remain essential in twenty-first-century electoral politics. For example, compare Weed to President Barack Obama’s adviser David Axelrod, one of today’s best-known political strategists.

Before entering politics, both Weed7 and Axelrod8 worked in the newspaper business where they learned the degree to which the news media can shape public opinion. During Weed’s career, the printed newspaper was king. In his media world, all newspapers were partisan organs like today’s Fox News Channel, Drudge Report, MSNBC, or the Huffington Post. With almost no formal schooling, Weed started out as a teenage typesetter and press operator for the _Albany Register_ in the state capital.9 There, he learned the ways of the political machine that ran the state legislature and government offices of New York. Much like today’s political bloggers, Weed launched his own _Evening Journal_ in 1830, using the paper and his bylined column to first support the Anti-Mason Party, then the Whig Party, before finally joining the newly formed Republican Party in 1856 in opposition to the Southern-dominated Democratic Party.10

Senator Seward himself said, “Weed is Seward, and Seward is Weed, each approves of what the other says or does.”11 No candidate today would publicly say such a thing, but trust and mutual dependence between candidate and manager remains essential in politics. Even after the wrenching 1860 defeat in Chicago, Seward reached out to console Weed and sustain their relationship. “You have my unbounded gratitude for this last [campaign], as for the whole life of efforts in my behalf. I wish that I was sure that your sense of disappointment is as light as my own,” Seward wrote in a letter to Weed after their 1860 defeat in Chicago.12

After losing the 1860 Republican nomination to Abraham Lincoln, Seward and Weed both became actively involved in Lincoln’s general election campaign. Seward went on to serve as Lincoln’s secretary of state.13 Weed also continued to be politically involved. In fact, Lincoln asked for Weed’s help in supporting Republicans in the 1862 congressional elections.14

Like Weed, Axelrod’s first job was at a newspaper. After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1977, Axelrod worked for the _Chicago Tribune_, becoming the paper’s youngest political writer before leaving journalism and joining the 1984 Illinois campaign of Democratic candidate Paul Simon for the US Senate.15 After starting as communications director, Axelrod eventually was named campaign manager. The underdog Simon went on to upset the popular three-term Republican incumbent, Senator Charles Percy, in a year when Republican Ronald Reagan carried Illinois and every other state except Minnesota. In the same state where Weed lost his final campaign, Axelrod won his first.

Journalism made Axelrod a better manager and strategist, he says now. “Because so much of what modern campaigns involve is about message and communications, having been a journalist was helpful to me.” He added, “When I was parachuted into campaigns as a reporter, I went in with some presumptions. But to me the job was to get on the ground and really understand what the political terrain was . . . to figure out what people were thinking, what voters were thinking. Those skills were very helpful as a strategist and as a manager.”16

Those skills came up short in 1988 when Axelrod, now playing the role of campaign consultant instead of manager, was the chief strategist for Senator Paul Simon’s (D-IL) campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Simon’s campaign gained early momentum with a stronger than expected second-place finish in Iowa, the first round of the nomination contest. But, in the next round, Simon lacked the cash to put Axelrod’s television ads on the air in New Hampshire, which includes the expensive Boston media market. Simon came in third in the Granite State behind eventual nominee Governor Michael Dukakis of neighboring Massachusetts.

Axelrod also lost with his next presidential candidate, Senator John Edwards (D-NC). It wasn’t until the third try that an Axelrod client made it to the White House. “You have to choose your candidates well . . . . But you also have to go in knowing that none of that guarantees victory in a very dynamic process in which so many factors can impact on the outcome,” said Axelrod. “You’re never as smart as you look when you win, and never as dumb as you look when you lose.”17

# Learning and Experimenting

After President Obama’s 2012 campaign outmaneuvered challenger Mitt Romney, the postelection coverage and conversation was dominated by talk of how much more sophisticated Democrats were with modern campaign mechanics and tools like big-data analytics. And, when it came to the use of the Internet, just about everybody thought the Democrats would have an enduring advantage in this new world of new media.18

But consider the case of Gary Coby. Coby was Donald Trump’s director of digital advertising and fundraising in 2016. Perhaps his family background primed him to be receptive to Trump’s message—“Pops works at AFL-CIO,” Coby says of his father’s job at the pro-Democratic labor organization. Coby’s first exposure to Republican politics and to the digital work that is now so crucial to running a strong campaign was Mitt Romney’s 2008 run for president. At the time, he was “working at some stupid job, just paying bills.” He got connected to Romney’s digital director through a former colleague and ended up running Romney’s e-mail marketing program.

Afterward, he stayed in the digital marketing agency world, which was still essentially brand new, and thoroughly explored that frontier. He experimented a lot, and learned more. “I taught myself a lot there. I did a lot of Facebook, a lot of acquisition, a lot of PR, direct response advertising,” remembers Coby. “Just kind of learned the ropes because no one there knew what they were doing. I didn’t have a lot of oversight, I would just wander and learn.”

Eventually, he wanted to come back to campaigns. He also saw how complex the digital landscape was (and still is) and he knew he needed to learn more about the sales side, and the publishers who sell ad space as a business model to fund their journalism. He combined these two desires by going to work for a company called Inner Markets, which represented conservative publications, including Drudge Report. “It was good to get a lot of knowledge from that side and how they work their deals and what they care about,” says Coby. “It gave me a lot of good insights.” He took those insights with him to his next job, which was a big one: running digital advertising for the Republican National Committee.

From that perch, he also garnered early insight into the phenomenon that was Donald Trump. During the primary, few people in the party were taking Trump seriously. But because of Coby’s skill in using digital tools to experiment and get quick feedback, he could see that they were making a big mistake. “I was doing a lot of the ad buying to build our lists for the eventual nominee,” says Coby. “We’re Switzerland, we can’t favor any candidate. So we did a straw poll where we asked the users, the voters, who they would vote for. Very basic, but a great acquisition tool because everyone wants to share their opinion. Trump would crush that straw poll for us.”

He also talks about the e-mails the RNC would get from voters, full of palpable enthusiasm for Trump. “We get a lot of insights from those on what people are thinking, and the excitement for him versus everyone else was just off the charts,” remembers Coby.

So he started “skewing subsequent buys toward Trump people around the end of October [2015]”—a smart move. Once Trump clinched the nomination, Coby formed important partnerships with people on the Trump campaign, first Brad Parscale, Trump’s digital media director, with whom he worked to build a 100-person operation in San Antonio, encompassing teams from various vendors, and, later—once the money started rolling in—Jared Kushner.

Coby also worked nearly around the clock. And, when others couldn’t keep up, forged ahead alone, making decisions without asking for permission from above. “I’m sleeping an hour or two a night and I feel like I’m moving like molasses,” Coby remembers. “I’m like, well, we need like three dozen more people moving at this pace, and that didn’t exist. I was about at the end of my wits. But obviously it was a great opportunity for me. I could never just walk away from it. So my mind-set became, _just do whatever the hell you think is best. Don’t care about the consequences. What’s the worst case, they send me home? So what_.”

Working for the RNC, and not the campaign itself, emboldened him, though “obviously, if the presidential campaign wants me gone, I’m sure they could have gotten me fired,” says Coby. “But it freed everyone up and everyone started thinking differently.” Coby’s “test everything” mentality spread.

Another trick to keep things moving fast was using Trump’s tweets as ad copy—no approvals necessary, one coherent message. “When stuff was breaking, we were up that day. Hillary’s folks, they were taking a day or two. This is the fastest news cycle any of us have ever seen. Stuff that would last a week was lasting hours. One of the biggest things that drove action, or drives action, is relevance to the user. So if I’m thinking about the things that are popping right now, they’re much more likely to engage with the content.”

The central idea was “screw the stuff that isn’t working. I’m going to maximize what is working,” says Coby. And a number of things worked very well. The campaign relied heavily on text messaging, the fastest way to reach users, and to reach them on a device where they’re likely to share what you’re sending them. The campaign gathered high-quality phone numbers by asking people to double opt-in for rally tickets. “You had to put in your phone number, then you got a text message and you had to confirm. That was your only way to get a rally ticket. For some reason, protesters didn’t want to give up their phone number. Or at least a real phone number, right? They probably put in a phony one. Because of this, we had a massive SMS list of our best users, the people going to the rallies. We had, we got up to about 50,000 users. That list was the most fruitful list that we had on the campaign.”

The campaign raised more than $11 million with simple text messages (SMS) and sent the first-ever video text message (MMS) from a campaign, where a single message once raised half a million dollars on its own. It also created a “Big League Truth Team” for rapid response during debates, texting a select group of supporters and pushing out links for sharing on social platforms.

They also innovated with live-streaming on Facebook and YouTube—sparked from Kushner’s idea to stream a millennial event in Ohio—mainly around the debates. The “Trump Tower Live” program was “basically doing a newscast in Trump Tower,” says Coby. “We knew we weren’t getting a fair shake in the media, so the whole mantra of Trump is direct to the people. That’s what Twitter is, right, so let’s keep rolling that ball down the field. When you can produce content that is very raw and authentic, people trust it way more. That’s essentially what we’re doing. It’s unfiltered, unmanipulated. We’re honest. We really hit a home run when we did that for the third debate, which was our biggest online fundraising day of the campaign. We raised nine million that day.”

There was more. “Snapchat did really well for us. Twitter was hit or miss. AOL was great for us,” says Coby. “We did a ton of Google search, obviously. We spent like six figures every day, net positive, on Google search.”

Coby also pressured big traditional tech vendors—Google, Twitter, Facebook—to commit time and personnel to the campaign’s effort, particularly the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. “I told them that if they didn’t put people on the ground with us, we weren’t spending money with them,” says Coby.

The volume of messages the campaign sent out, the spirit of experimentation, and most of all the pace of the campaign was a significant change for the Republicans from past elections. “You know, I worked on the last couple presidential cycles and was on the ground with the Romney campaign, and other campaigns. There’s so much bureaucracy. There’s so much slow-moving decision making, and safe decisions,” says Coby. “In this campaign, we just embraced following the numbers and whatever worked, worked. We had this amazing cover fire of a candidate that drew a lot of attention. Press was heavily focused on him. If we did some stupid ad or stupid e-mail that might traditionally get an article, no one was paying attention to that. So we were free to really test and run wild. Also, expectations were very low. They expected us all to just suck.”

# Why Campaign Managers Do It

Most managers and staffers suffer lows between the highs—and only a handful enjoy the high of winning a presidential election. As Gary Coby discussed, they talk about insane work schedules and a world in which the news media loves, then hates; supporters believe, then doubt; and campaign decisions are second-guessed by the press and by everyone else. Candidates are subjected to personal attacks that seem unfair, there’s never enough money, and there’s always a good chance of ending up an unemployed loser. So why do most campaign managers and staffers keep coming back for more?

For many, it’s the prospect of the thrill of victory. “I mean, it’s just sickness, we’re all infected with it,” said Joe Abbey, who ran Democrat Ned Lamont’s unsuccessful campaign for governor of Connecticut in 2010. “The rush of a campaign, man, election night, when you win. There’s no other feeling like that in the world. . . . You’re exhausted, you haven’t eaten real food in months, and you’ve poured your whole life into a cause and you win.”19

Win or lose, campaign managers also are rewarded by the chance to develop an uncommon bond like Seward and Weed shared, almost a codependence, with a candidate they believe in. In exchange for investing life and career in electing their candidate, the manager becomes the candidate’s whisperer and keeper. This bond provides its own sort of high. “Campaign managers get a bad rap that they’re mercenaries. Well, we’re not,” said Martha McKenna, who ran Democrat Sheila Dixon’s winning 2007 race for mayor of Baltimore.20 “I think of it as the most brave and courageous thing to do to put your name on the ballot. And it’s something that I don’t think I could do. But when you’re the campaign manager and you’re entrusted with that person’s name and reputation, that comes with seriousness and a responsibility that’s both important and exhilarating”21 (see Box 1.1).

Box 1.1 David Axelrod’s Three Key Qualities in a Candidate–Manager Relationship

“If you have these three elements, you have the makings of a strong manager and a strong candidate–manager relationship”:

1. **Values:** The manager and the campaign must consistently reflect the candidate’s values.
2. **Competence:** The manager must be strategically and tactically sound.
3. **Control:** The candidate trusts and delegates control of the campaign organization to the manager.

Some campaign managers do it clear-eyed as a career-building investment that can pay off with other professional opportunities. There’s always the prospect of a staff job after a winning campaign. Managers also come into close contact with the lawmakers, businesspeople, and wealthy donors who make up a candidate’s surrogate bench or inner circle. Losing a race doesn’t preclude a campaign manager from making a good impression with these future potential employers or clients. “I can’t tell you the millionaires that I know that started doing campaigns,” Screven Watson told us.22 Watson ran Democrat Rod Smith’s unsuccessful 2006 campaign for governor of Florida and was later hired as a lobbyist. “I’m not one of them, not smart enough, but the people that got involved in the campaign and got identified as a talent, they got sucked up.”23

Campaign managers are the field marshals in America’s ceaseless war for governing power. Many people understand that elections have significant consequences, but few have any idea of what it takes to win one. Most scholarly work on the subject has focused on factors that drive how people vote. In the process, some scholars have concluded that campaigns don’t much matter (see Chapter 2]], Political Math: How Campaigns Matter). Other research has been conducted on the effects of big-ticket campaign tactics such as television advertising and voter mobilization.

Box 1.2 From the Campaign Manager Survey: The Candidate–Manager Relationship

Like Seward and Weed, and Obama and Axelrod, the right relationship between a candidate and their campaign manager is an important part of electoral success.

The manager’s got to do that.29

Until now, almost no attention has been paid to the unique role of the manager and what it teaches us about elections in America. This book is not intended as a substitute for hands-on experience but as a means to constructively share managers’ experiences and to understand campaigns and elections through the eyes of those who manage them. This book also serves as a window into how campaigns affect who wins and who loses and the struggle for power in modern American democracy. According to Steven Law, manager of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) 1990 campaign and now of American Crossroads, one of the highest-spending advertisers in Republican politics today, “You just don’t get campaigns until you work on campaigns.”30

# What Campaigns Do

Based on our conversations with campaign managers, we developed a flowchart model describing what happens in campaigns (see Figure 1.2]]). This is not an organizational chart describing jobs and personnel. Instead, it is a dynamic model showing what campaigns do on a day-to-day basis, describing key activities, five core questions that drive the campaign, and the tracking loops that campaign managers use to measure their expected performance on election day. These feedback loops are critical to the success of a campaign and are another area in which political campaigns differ from consumer marketing campaigns. The consumer brand manager has the luxury of daily sales data, but the political campaign manager can never be sure of which voters are sold on their candidate and will not see any hard sales numbers until election night.

The questions are ones that virtually every candidate running in a competitive election—whether it’s a presidential or city council race—must ask and answer to be successful: (1) “Who are our targets?” represents the coalition that the campaign must assemble in order to reach 50.1 percent of the vote (assuming a two-person race). (2) “How do we reach them?” involves the methods available to a campaign to mobilize and persuade their targeted voters with their limited resources. (3) “What do we tell them?” reflects a need on every campaign to drive a clear message about why its candidate deserves a voter’s support and why the opponent would be harmful to the voters’ interests. (4) “How are we doing?” encompasses the feedback loop that helps managers track their progress and adjust the campaign’s tactics and strategy according to how they’re faring. (5) “What are they doing?” sheds light on what the opposing side is doing to target, mobilize, and persuade their own voters and whether attacks by the opposition need to be answered; increasingly, nowadays, “What are they doing?” also spurs a conversation about the influence of super PACs (political action committees) (friend and foe) on voters’ views of the candidates and the issues. Taken together, these questions guide the strategic decisions and tactical choices that each campaign manager and their team must make. These five questions structure each campaign’s quest to win the election.

![[10.jpeg]]

Figure 1.2 What Campaigns Do in Five Questions

## The Targeting and Retargeting of Voters

What will the candidate’s winning coalition look like? This “Who are our target voters?” question must be the starting point of every campaign. Targeting voters who support a candidate but may or may not vote, as well as targeting likely voters who remain undecided in their choice, remains a central element of any campaign operation. That’s why we put “Who are our target voters?” at the top of Figure 1.2]]. Without knowing what a winning coalition looks like, the campaign can’t create a strategy, refine its message, and allocate its finite resources to conduct its campaign activities. When Thurlow Weed was managing William H. Seward’s US Senate campaigns, members of state legislatures—not individual voters—did the electing. Weed could keep a list of all the eligible voters in his coat pocket along with updates on each voter’s concerns, when they were last contacted on Seward’s behalf, and the latest estimate of how they were likely to vote.

Today’s campaign manager also can keep a detailed and updated voter list in his or her pocket, but that list could contain millions of names and would be on a mobile device or portable data drive. The growing affordability of computing power and data storage means campaigns can target and track millions of individual voters. They must set aggregate vote goals by precinct and other geography, by party identification, by demographic group, and for other buckets of voters.

Beyond that, today’s sophisticated campaigns start by building a voter file that is maintained, enhanced, and updated in a database management program. Based on voting history, party registration (when available), and other individual information, the campaign can describe its winning coalition voter by voter. The voter database is continually updated with results of phone calls, door-knocking visits, and other forms of direct voter contact that can include use of online and social media, volunteering and donating habits, and other one-on-one touch points (see “Internal Tracking Tools” feedback loop in the model). The “human touch” in modern campaigns is very much data assisted.

Axelrod and his team of Obama managers invested millions to build the most sophisticated and dynamic voter database in political history. They also built a culture of data analysis–driven decision making, hiring dozens of data analysts who provided Axelrod and other senior staff the daily intelligence they needed. After most news reports said Romney “won” the first presidential debate with Obama in early October 2012, public opinion polls showed the race tightening with Romney moving ahead in some surveys for the first time. Yet at the Obama headquarters in Chicago, confidence was unshaken. Based on thousands of nightly interviews with samples drawn from their voter database, Obama’s analysts concluded that Romney’s gains were among voters who should have been supporting the Republican in the first place.

Axelrod publicly offered to shave his mustache if Obama lost the election—but only after checking one more time with the campaign’s chief data scientists. Ironically, it was some of these same data scientists who were predicting an even more comfortable Hillary Clinton victory in 2016. Although their math skills were the same, they mistakenly assumed that the structure of the electorate—which voters would show up and in what numbers—would look similar with Clinton on the top of the ticket as it had with Obama on the top of the ticket.

## Messaging and Creative Strategy

In twenty-first-century American politics, campaigns—for public office or to influence public policy—are often won and lost at the margins by the side that does the best job of developing, testing, and delivering the most compelling messages possible to their targeted voters. Every campaign needs a narrative arc, both about its own candidate and her positions on the issues, and about the opposing side. What traits, experiences, or positions does the candidate possess that appeal to the target voters? How would the candidate improve these voters’ lives, and how would the other side affect voters’ lives in a negative way? Getting back to the campaign-as-marketing operation analogy, campaigns need to test what sort of branding (in the form of logos and other graphics) and look and feel (for its events) it should have.

All of this occurs through a creative testing process (“What do we tell them?”) that involves the manager overseeing a team of advertising consultants, pollsters, graphic artists, and often the candidate and the candidate’s family. This process yields the messages that the campaign uses to appeal to its targeted voters. Although the overarching message is typically held constant and ideally doesn’t change much (think Obama’s 2008 “hope and change” message or Trump’s “make America great again” message), the campaign can tailor messages to discrete audiences based on their distinct concerns and particular political passions.

## Communications Strategy and Budget

This is the “war room” side of the communications operation—the constant grind of media and social media outreach, the rapid response operation, event planning. It’s also the purse string side of the operation.

Advertising is typically the single biggest expense of any campaign. Many campaigns deploy a mix of television, radio, and digital along with direct mail. Print advertising is rarely used anymore, though in races in prohibitively expensive media markets, campaigns may forgo TV and invest more heavily in the other forms of advertising.

Opposition research—essentially, a book on the exploitable weaknesses of one’s opponent—also falls under this category. The first target for any opposition researcher is the researcher’s own candidate. The vastness of the Internet makes this process both easier and tougher: It’s easier to conduct extensive research on one’s own candidate and identify any potential issues that might be thrown at a candidate. However, one can never be sure she has found everything. Once one has achieved as much certainty as possible, the researcher sets his or her sights on the candidate’s opponents.

## Fundraising

With advertising typically being the single biggest expense of any campaign, managers can feel at times as though the fundraisers basically exist to pay for advertising. It’s actually a more reciprocal relationship (see the “Donor Relationship Management” loop in the model). Advertising, particularly on TV, can be a shorthand way of telling potential big donors that your candidate is “real” or viable.

At the same time, not all advertising is aimed at persuasion. As Gary Coby told us, digital advertising has become an effective way to raise smaller contributions because online ads can link through to fundraising forms that appear alongside information, even videos, about the candidate. As critical as those massive contributions from big donors are for building a substantial financial foundation for a campaign, the smaller contributions become the fuel that keeps the campaign going. Small donors can be solicited over and over again before they reach the fundraising cap; small-dollar donors tend to view their contributions as an investment and are more likely to help in other ways, either financially or by volunteering to knock on doors or make phone calls.

Media coverage of the candidate also tends to boost fundraising—and not just when the news is good. Savvy campaign communicators can turn bad news into effective fundraising pitches, especially over the Internet for the kind of small-dollar contributions that are relatively easy for a candidate’s faithful to give.

# The Roles and Goals of a Campaign Manager

Campaigns are one of the most consistent growth industries in the American economy, with the most recent fundraising and spending totals smashing all records and dwarfing what was conceivable only a few years ago. The total cost of congressional and presidential races combined approached $7 billion in 2016 (see Figure 1.3]]), and spending will surely exceed that amount in 2020.31

Meanwhile, more and more media outlets obsessively cover how much money is being raised and spent, and they minutely track all of the activities that comprise modern campaigning. Whereas the flowchart model (Figure 1.2]]) captures the dynamism of a campaign’s inner workings, the following chart (Figure 1.4]]) offers a succinct take on the core activities that appear on any campaign manager’s to-do list.

But, stepping back for a moment from the campaign’s activities, we must ask some hard questions about the nature of modern elections: Do they matter? Is most of the money raised and spent squandered on useless activities? Do any of the activities referred to in Figure 1.4]] have a measurable impact on determining losers and winners? Some political scientists who study campaigns have argued that campaign activities have minimal to zero effect on the ultimate election results. In other words, they say that all of the money raised and spent, and all of the enormous effort expended on electioneering, tend to cancel each other out. They also argue that the fundamentals of the campaign—indicators such as the gross domestic product, presidential approval ratings, the partisan distribution of a given state or district—are the biggest drivers that determine election results.

But let’s frame the “so-what” issue in a different light: If campaigns are typically humming with activity (raising funds, researching opponents, targeting voters), what does it all add up to? _Do campaigns matter? If campaigns do matter, how do they matter?_ Why should we study campaigns? Why _do_ campaigns? Why do accomplished women and men devote so much time, sweat, and money to activities that perhaps at best have a meager effect on electing candidates to office?

This is no idle theoretical debate. As you will find in Chapter 2]] and elsewhere in this book, campaigns matter—and in particularly crucial ways that depend on the political climate, the nature of the electorate, and other variables, some of them under the campaign’s control. Our 100-plus interviews with America’s foremost campaign managers yield some insights into how and why campaigns make a difference at the electoral margins and show that pundits are prone to overplaying the effects of campaigns, whereas the majority of political scientists tend to underestimate the effects of campaigns.

Looked at another way, all campaign managers need to answer the five questions featured in the workflow campaign model (Figure 1.2]]), and how well a campaign is able to answer these questions can be, and often is, determined on election day: _Who are our target voters? How do we reach them? What do we tell them? How are we doing? What are they doing?_ These core questions, deceptively simple sounding, are actually rather complicated. They frame the roles that ultimately all campaign managers must fill in order to be effective at their jobs. In addition, campaign managers not only have to answer these questions, but these questions are interdependent, and managers must wear multiple hats as they structure their campaigns to put their candidates in a position to win their elections.

![[13.jpeg]]

Figure 1.5 What Campaign Managers Do: Ten Key Roles the Campaign Manager Must Play

Campaign managers have to play a series of roles so that they can answer these questions and run their campaigns effectively. Ultimately, the campaign manager is responsible for the smooth and synchronized functioning of the workflow and performance of any campaign. Although a manager’s particular experiences might make him or her an expert in a certain part of the process, most managers are generalists who can wear many different hats. In their conversations with us, they have described an array of roles they’ve had to play that may be more varied and complex than the expectations for the average CEO of a Fortune 500 company. We’ve grouped these roles into chapters (see Figure 1.5]]) that correspond to the ten roles.

These ten “hats” that any successful campaign manager must wear will guide us as we explore how campaigns function and how they can affect the outcome of elections. Managers that excel in these roles and ask and effectively answer the five questions do not guarantee that their candidate will triumph, of course. But they can give their campaigns the kind of organization, messaging, strategic direction, and steadiness that in modern American politics is necessary to compete in some of the hardest contests our society knows, contests with tens of millions of dollars as well as issues of war, peace, the economy, and civic society often riding on the outcome.

# 2 Political Math How Campaigns Matter

**N**o presidential election was closer—and no result more hotly contested in recent times—than Gore’s 537-vote loss in Florida to Bush in 2000. After 2000, does anybody think that Gore or Bush would ever say that marginal differences in the vote don’t matter? Or that they don’t affect election results, let alone the course of history? Virtually every campaign manager has been on the losing and winning sides of some narrowly decided elections. Although these contests were not as high profile as the Gore-Bush race, they were seared into the brains of the managers who ran the races, convincing them that marginal differences in performance and share, all structured by particular fundamentals, absolutely were, and still are, the difference makers in whether they lost or won.

The fact is, the Gore-Bush result was not even all that much of a freak occurrence, either. The political landscape is strewn with the names of would-be victors who lost by excruciatingly tight vote margins and sure winners who became ignominious losers. Gore and Kerry led Democrats to two bitterly close defeats in the 2000 and 2004 presidential races, and Republican Senate candidates experienced something similar when they lost where they should have won in Nevada and Delaware in 2010, in Indiana and Missouri in 2012, and in Alabama in 2017. In Virginia, control of the state assembly in 2017 was decided by picking a name out of a hat when the deciding legislative race in the state ended in a tie—each with 11,608 votes.

Among scholars, however, the notion that campaigns and candidates matter is not uncontroversial. In fact, the notion that elections are primarily determined by a set of structural, underlying economic, demographic, and partisan fundamentals, completely outside the control of candidates and campaigns, dominates scholarly conventional wisdom. For example, in an article that garnered significant media attention, Kalla and Broockman found no evidence “that persuasive contact activates a candidate’s supporters to turn out.”1 They contrasted their finding with what they categorize as the conventional wisdom of campaign professionals: “Campaigns spend a great deal of money advertising to voters and the firms and consultants who profit from these activities argue that their effects are large.” In media coverage of the article, one of the authors doubled down on this maximalist characterization of campaign manager thinking. “A lot of campaign operatives think there’s this big pool of moderate, undecided voters that we can spend money on to persuade them to our side.”2

Campaign managers tend to roll their eyes at such absolutist scholarly characterizations of campaign effects. In fact, we talked to over a hundred campaign managers, and not a single one suggested to us that campaign effects are “large,” and none seemed to believe that there are big pools of “moderate undecided voters.” Consistent with decades of scholarly research, to a person, they agreed that the fundamentals greatly matter, but they also believed that they don’t explain _every_ last percentage point of election outcomes. Put another way, although a massive effects “fantasy” world may be the reality of cable television news, it is not the reality for most campaign managers with whom we spoke. In fact, it is not the reality if one carefully reads the scholarly research.3 The fundamentals leave ample room for marginal effects of turnout or persuasion.

In other words, campaign managers understand that the fundamentals matter, but they also believe the fundamentals don’t point to a clear and obvious winner in many competitive elections. Based on their extensive practical experiences, campaigns, they conclude, have the ability to mobilize and persuade voters and affect the margins of the vote total.

Are those who say fundamentals matter most and campaigns hardly register on the results correct? Are those who say mobilization is most vital correct? What about those who say persuasion is the most important factor? Put differently, do political campaigns matter? If they matter, then do they matter by mobilizing their side’s partisan voters or by persuading swing voters to vote for them? This is no idle academic debate. How operatives and academics answer these questions has consequences in the real world. This debate has not only defined how political scientists have explained election outcomes, but it also is now shaping how the men and women in charge of campaigns spend their resources and plot and execute their strategies.

# The Fundamentals

Kalla and Broockman are not alone in their belief that campaigns rarely have effects that decide election results. A great many political scientists argue that the “fundamentals”—the performance of the economy, an incumbent’s approval ratings, and the partisan composition of the electorate—ultimately sort winners from losers, not the hundreds of decisions, large and small, that campaign managers and candidates make. Some of the leading scholars of the field have made claims along these lines:

> Almost all politicians and journalists and citizens way exaggerate the effect of the campaign. Most voters don’t change their minds, period.4
> 
> —Michael Lewis-Beck, University of Iowa

> When you’re in the middle of a campaign, there’s a tendency for people, especially the media, to overestimate the importance of certain events. [Gaffes, advertising, debates, etc. have no measurable impact on voters’ decisions.] The media are interested in getting people’s attention, but a lot of the stories you read or see are focusing on things that are trivial. The way campaigns play out is largely determined by fundamentals.5
> 
> —Alan Abramowitz

> The assumption is that the major parties basically nominate reasonable candidates that are both well-funded and reasonably well organized. They have equally good pollsters, media advisers, strategists. Therefore, they tend to cancel each other out.6
> 
> —James Campbell

> Both sides are pulling very hard. If, for some reason, one side let go—meaning they stopped campaigning—then the other side would soon benefit. But of course the candidates do not let go and that makes it hard to see that their efforts are making a difference. . . . We argue that it means they are equally effective.7
> 
> —John Sides and Lynn Vavreck, _The Gamble_

> The scholarly consensus, specifically on _direct persuasive effects of media on vote choice_—the type of effect that most fascinates the public and the media—is still that media’s impact is marginal at most. . . . There is little evidence of direct persuasive effects [on national campaigns from] the slick, highly professional advertising that most Americans think of as powerful.8
> 
> —Diana C. Mutz

> There’s always more ocean, and there are always more plausible-sounding special explanations for Obama’s victory—including demographic shifts, early ads, clever microtargeting, and a fortuitous storm, among many others. Some of them may even have merit. But what all of them have in common is that they are superfluous. In 2012, as in 2008, Obama’s electoral performance was quite consistent with what might have been expected on the basis of political fundamentals.9
> 
> Larry Bartels

Such scholarly doubt—and even exasperation at the way the media cover the ticktock of a campaign—is rooted in several assumptions. Scholars argue that the nature of the times (the state of the economy) and the partisan distribution of likely voters are the key fundamental factors influencing election outcomes. Scholars assume that underlying factors either do or do not favor a candidate and that no amount of campaign spending or brilliant strategy can change the likely election outcome. The scholarly skepticism also rests on the theory that even if campaigns had the potential to change entrenched minds and outweigh the nature of the times, there would need to be measurable differences in the impact of the competing advertising campaigns.10 And the overwhelming conventional wisdom among political scientists is simply that such differences rarely exist in competitive US races. The two sides, in other words, tend to cancel out each other’s activities.

Campaign managers also make a key point about the structure of this debate about campaigns and their effects on election results. They say that although most of the scholarly research is on presidential elections, these are the contests in which fundamentals are likely to matter the most and campaigns are likely to matter the least. Of course, there are many thousands of nonpresidential elections in the United States every year that not only determine control of the US Congress but state legislatures, city councils, city halls, and governors’ mansions across the nation.

“Maybe [the notion that campaigns have little effect] has some validity on a presidential level,” one campaign manager we talked to argued. “But on state and local levels, I think the campaigns make all the difference. I can point to survey data showing that specific ads and messages moved voters and made differences in almost every campaign I’ve worked on.”11 Down-ballot races—races for city council, school board, mayor’s offices—are more susceptible to campaigns’ effects than higher-profile (congressional) races because the quality of the campaigns varies more widely at the local level, according to some campaign managers. And campaigns that are held during off years (when neither presidential nor midterm elections are taking place) can have a bigger impact on elections because there are few national races shaping the political environment and interfering with the state and local campaigns’ messages.

Consider how campaign managers replied when asked for their views on how campaigns have the ability to influence results:

> I think the further you go down the ballot, the more important it is. I think at the presidential level, it’s probably true that 80 percent of what occurs is out of the campaign’s control, but the 20 percent that is does matter. As you go farther down, the more impact it has.12
> 
> —Carl Forti, American Crossroads

> There is an idea informed by academic literature that says campaigns don’t have a massive effect on [elections]. But I think it’s important to drill down to the small number of actual competitive campaigns—and the small number of voters in your persuasion or mobilization universe. Most successful campaigns don’t need to involve moving huge percentages of the electorate. For example, I think that field organizing is really important, but field has never been shown, even in super low turnout special elections in awful weather, to move more than 5 to 6 percent of the vote. But that’s a huge amount if 20 percent of the electorate’s the only part that’s up for grabs. Campaigns can make a critical difference when focused appropriately—and real analysis should understand these areas of focus.13
> 
> —Todd Schulte, campaign strategist

> I think they have a ton [of impact]. Now I’m in the business to run effective campaigns, so I guess take that with a grain of salt, but to some extent they’re right. I mean, you have certain waves. But a campaign’s effectiveness is whether they can be in place to catch that wave, whether they’ve raised enough money to deliver their message, whether they’ve found enough volunteers and activists to, you know, generate momentum on a grassroots level.14
> 
> —Graham Shafer, Van Hilleary for Governor, 2002 (TN)

> Particularly in your open seats and swing state statewide elections, campaigns absolutely matter. In 2010, you look at campaigns like Rick Scott in Florida who was relatively unknown and running against a well-known statewide elected candidate in Bill McCollum. Marco Rubio, nobody knew who Marco Rubio was but they ran a heck of a campaign. If there was no campaign, Charlie Crist would have blown Marco Rubio away. But campaigns, at the highest levels, at the most expensive levels, in the congressional races above absolutely matter. If you’re not raising money, executing a paid and earned media plan, others will define you. . . . Say you’re a popular governor . . . your approval rating is at 60 percent. Does a campaign really matter if you have a weak opponent? Probably not . . . until something happens and your approval dips into the low fifties or high forties. What if you throw somebody with $50 million, no name ID, and is running against somebody that’s teetering on a 50 percent approval rating? Then you have big problems. Absolutely it matters. . . . The higher the profile, the more competitive the state and the stronger people feel like the outcome affects them, in a congressional, senate, governor’s, more money will be spent and the more the campaigns matter.15
> 
> —Kyle Robertson, Rick Snyder for Governor, 2014 (MI)

> I know they matter. . . . I’ve run really good races in bad years and we were going to lose no matter what. But do I think that had we run a terrible race, we would have gotten 40 instead of 46 in a race? Probably. It just meant that there was no real way to get to 50+1, you know?16
> 
> —Mark Harris, Pat Toomey for US Senate, 2010 (PA)

# The Role of Fundamentals: From Demographics to Party ID

Let’s go deeper on the question of fundamentals. How do scholars and nonscholars define them? The fundamentals of race and ethnicity and gender are often the metrics by which they segment the electorate into discrete chunks of voters and then from there figure out the odds each side has of victory ahead of election day. To such observers, the crucial point is to estimate the size and the turnout percentages of different racial and ethnic groups (e.g., blacks, whites, Latinos) in the electorate.17

As political professionals and scholars try to forecast how future presidential races will unfold, no question is more momentous than whether the surge in minority turnout, the demographics, will continue to favor the Democrats. Will future Democratic presidential nominees enjoy the same advantage in the demographic composition of the electorate that launched Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012, or without Obama on the ballot will Democrats struggle to get nonwhite voters to the polls as they did in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections and the 2016 presidential election—even as their percentage of the eligible electorate increases?18, 19

Demographics are a powerful way to think about the shape and predispositions of the electorate (the number and kind of eligible voters and the breakdown of the voters who actually show up and vote on election day), and demographics can correlate fairly strongly with vote choice and are sometimes used for targeting by campaigns (See Table 2.1]]). But _partisan affiliation_ is a more proximate cause, more strongly correlates with voter choices, and is the most common metric used for targeting by the campaigns themselves. Party ID is how campaign managers typically look at the fundamentals of the electorate and see which side, based on the fundamentals, holds an edge in any given contest.

Table 2.1 ![[15.jpeg]]

_Source:_ Data from adjusted percentages; 2004, 2008: [https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p20-568.pdf](https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p20-568.pdf\); 2012, 2016: Center for American Progress; US Census Bureau.

Consider the following tables. They demonstrate how elections can be about simple math—calculating how many Republicans, Democrats, and independents will turn out and what percentage each side needs to reach a winning margin. The figures within the parentheses show what percentage of the electorate was Democratic, Republican, and independent. The percentages in the columns represent what proportion of each partisan group voted for the Democratic or Republican candidate. For example, as shown in Table 2.2]], in 2008, Democrats comprised 39 percent of the electorate, and candidate Obama won the support of 89 percent of these Democratic voters.

In 2012, the election was more competitive, but Obama still won 51 percent of the popular vote.20 Romney improved on McCain’s (and Bush’s) showing, winning independents by 5 percentage points. But these gains weren’t enough to offset the ultimately decisive 6 percentage point advantage that Obama held over Romney in Democratic versus Republican share of turnout, as Table 2.3]] illustrates. In 2016, Democrats only had a 3 percentage point advantage in the composition of the electorate. Although Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote, her margin was narrower than Obama and did not translate into victories in enough states to earn a majority in the Electoral College (see Table 2.4]]).

Table 2.2 ![[16.jpeg]]

Table 2.4 ![[18.jpeg]]

The 2010 and 2014 House election results (see Tables 2.5]] and 2.6]]), in contrast, demonstrated how the partisan split of the electorate worked to benefit the Republicans during lower-turnout midterm congressional campaigns. Unlike the turnout advantage Democrats held in 2008 and 2012 and to a lesser extent in 2016, the midterm electorates were evenly divided between Republican identifiers and Democratic identifiers, and this evenly distributed partisan composition ultimately helped the Republicans to big midterm victories.

Clearly, fundamental factors—partisan composition of a district or state, incumbent approval ratings (basically, a voter referendum on how an officeholder is performing his or her duties), or economic performance (voters’ sense of how the economy is affecting their lives)—are key drivers in most presidential and congressional campaigns. No one really controls these factors; hence, they are called fundamentals. And, as some campaign managers acknowledge, the underlying circumstances (described in this paragraph) explain almost every last percentage point of recent election results.21

# Share and Performance

But, as much as the fundamentals help us understand election outcomes and shape campaign strategies, the fundamental factors such as demography, party ID, and economic performance are in most cases not enough by themselves to explain fully why one side loses and the other side wins. Both _share_ (mobilizing one’s partisans to vote) and _performance_ (persuading swing voters to vote for one’s candidate) can and often do influence election outcomes; in other words, the campaigns’ activities to try to improve their share of the electorate and their performance among swing voters could be difference makers on election day.

In a basic calculus every campaign manager must make, elections can be won or lost by how well the campaign succeeds at the following five goals:

1. **Get a large share of the votes from your own identifiers.** Democrats, for example, need to lock down the Democratic base and must shoot to get at least 90 percent of the Democratic vote. Republicans must do the same with their own partisans.
2. **Get high turnout from one’s own identifiers.** Most Democrats are going to vote for Democrats, and most Republicans are going to vote for Republicans. But it is crucial for both political parties to generate as much turnout from their side as possible to maximize their vote totals.
3. **Get some of the other candidate’s supporters.** It is very difficult to convince members of the opposite party to vote for one’s candidate. But if it happens, it can make a big difference; not only do these votes count for one’s candidate but they are also subtracted from the total of the opponent.
4. **Lower turnout among the other candidate’s identifiers.** If the opponent’s base is angry or unenthusiastic, it can cost him or her votes. Getting one’s opponent’s supporters to vote for one’s candidate is the best possible scenario, but getting them to refrain from voting at all is the next best option. That’s why laws governing elections and absentee ballots and registration rules matter so much to parties and their strategists. When Republicans and Democrats battle over voter ID rules, the Democrats are not simply fighting to protect democracy and Republicans are not protecting integrity; both sides have a direct electoral stake in such rules because the rules affect the composition of the electorate.
5. **Win swing votes.** Even if one believes that there are relatively few swing voters, there are not _zero_ swing voters, and their behavior can be decisive at the margin in a close election. The main driver of partisan loyalty, voter turnout, and the division among independent or undecided voters (no matter how few there may actually be) is the nature of the times. But having said that, most campaign managers are trying to get _a little more_ turnout of their supporters or persuade _a few_ “undecideds” to come their way.

Another way that campaign managers approach this problem is to think in terms of possible Democratic and Republican targets, as Figures 2.1]] and 2.2]] illustrate. Democrats aim to mobilize their party members and maximize their loyalty or performance while also trying to earn the votes of independents. Republicans aim for the inverse.

Consider just how hard it is for a campaign manager to assess the electorate and chart a winning path. Say the candidate is a Democrat running for statewide office in a heavily Republican state, like the 2017 special election in Alabama. The campaign manager must employ multiple strategies that involve both turnout and persuasion, share and performance. In the Alabama contest, Democrats could not hope to win the Senate seat by re-creating the composition of the 2012 or 2014 electorates. Instead, they needed to turn out their own identifiers in high numbers (largely black voters), get a large share of their partisans to vote for them, win swing voters, and depress turnout on the other side or persuade some of the other side’s supporters to vote for them. Even the most astute campaign manager would have a tough time pulling off such a feat. But with a particularly weak Republican candidate, Democrats were able to pull off the “quadruple bank shot.”

![[21.jpeg]]

Figure 2.1 Expected Targeting by Democrats in Competitive Races

![[22.jpeg]]

Figure 2.2 Expected Targeting by Republicans in Competitive Races

Ultimately, each manager in a competitive race faces a series of hard choices, illustrated by the five goals and two tables described previously.

Campaign managers recognize that the structure of a state or district (and thus the predispositions of the electorate) influences which and how many of these strategies will be used. Although there might be a variety of theoretical solutions to the algebra word problem of 50 percent plus 1, realistically, campaign managers have limited time, money, and resources. After evaluating the fundamentals, campaign managers must decide on the best strategy: How strongly should they pursue each of the five goals listed previously? Should they try to get people who are going to vote for their candidates—but may not be inclined to show up—to go to the polls on election day? Or should they attempt to win over people who are going to vote but who may vote for the opposition? If a candidate gets a very high percentage of the vote from her own identifiers and they show up to the polls in droves, then she may not even need to worry about winning over swing voters or members of the opposing party.

## Campaign Math

Typically, campaign managers have to solve some basic election math to figure out how best to achieve the marginal edge that will carry their candidate to victory. Remember that the goal is to win, of course, and that winning means earning 50.1 percent of the vote. Therefore, campaign managers can solve the basic algebra problem by looking at the following table (Table 2.7]]) and then solving the mathematical formulation that follows.

How does that math work in the 2016 election? Using the exit poll results we reported in Table 2.4]], we can do a little math and multiply the proportion of the electorate for each party category by each candidate’s performance among that category. Doing this, we get a one-and-a-half-point Clinton victory in the national popular vote.

Table 2.7 ![[23.jpeg]]

Democratic total = (X*A) + (Y*C) + (Z*E)

Republican total = (X*B) + (Y*D) + (Z*F)

> Clinton total = (.36)(.89) + (.31)(.42) + (.33)(.08) = .3204 + .1302 + .0264 = .477
> 
> Trump total = (.36)(.08) + (.31)(.46) + (.33)(.88) = .0288 + .1426 + .2904 = .4618
> 
> Clinton total = 47.70%
> 
> Trump total = 46.18%

The battles for Congress and president are of course not decided by a national vote but state by state and district by district. And managing campaigns and winning elective office are exercises in influencing the letters, influencing share and performance in individual states and districts. Solving these algebra word problems are far from theoretical undertakings. Democratic campaign operative Steve Rosenthal, for example, summed up his approach to influencing the letters as illustrated by the equations just highlighted:

> I start in any campaign [trying] to begin to visualize a state or a district in terms of how many people voted here. Is this a presidential year, is it a midterm year, is it an off year? How many people have voted in each of the last several elections in those presidential, midterm, off-year elections? What’s happened to the population over the last few years? Is it going to change? What’s the turnout likely to be? What’s 50 percent plus 1 of that turnout? We generally set a vote goal of 52 percent and then begin to work from there. . . . Let’s take a look at a state like Ohio, for example, and understand Barack Obama won it, Ted Strickland won it and lost it, Sherrod Brown won it. Can we overlay the results of those elections and begin to understand the difference between what the path was that each of them took to get there? And now I’m approaching the state with a new candidate. What’s the path that I’m going to use? Where are the votes, geographically, demographically, that are going to get me the majority that I need to win?22
> 
> —Steve Rosenthal, founder, the Atlas Project

In other words, Rosenthal is seeking to improve one side’s performance among those voters open to being swayed and/or expanding one’s share of partisan voters who show up to the polls. The mathematical functions underscore the dynamism of the interdependent factors that make up the marginal variation in many close races—a difference between losing and winning. Although these math formulas may seem relatively straightforward (i.e., solve the algebra problem and win first place), winning 50.1 percent of the vote requires influencing the letters through any number of distinct ways. The choices managers make depend on the predispositions of the electorate, the political environment, which voters campaigns need to reach, and what the most effective messages will be.

Again, the math depends on the state or district. Let’s say the candidate is a Republican running for statewide office in Utah, which is one of the most solidly GOP states. The only options the manager will need to focus on are getting a large share of the voters from your own identifiers and getting high turnout from your own identifiers. In simpler terms, make sure Republican voters support the candidate and get them to the polls. There is no need to worry about Democratic turnout or party loyalty because there are vastly more Republicans than Democrats. In fact, in this scenario, there is not even any need to worry about independents. The same math works in states like Rhode Island or Massachusetts, only with Democrats as the dominant party.

In the weeks leading up to Election Day 2016, accounts suggest that Clinton operatives were confident in their math. They believed that Democrats would have an advantage in share that equaled or exceeded that of Obama in 2008 and 2012. They believed that Democrats would be as loyal to their nominee as they had been in the past two contests, and turn out in similar numbers. And they believed that Republicans would be less loyal to their nominee, Donald Trump.23

Furthermore, they believed that a “blue wall” of states anchored by Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan made it virtually impossible for Trump to find a path to 270 Electoral College votes. Pennsylvania and Michigan had gone for the Democratic nominee for president in the last six elections, and Wisconsin had supported the Democrat for president in the last seven elections. Ronald Reagan was the last Republican to win Wisconsin, and Obama had won each of the three states by a comfortable margin in 2012: Pennsylvania by 5 points, Michigan by 9 points, and Wisconsin by 7 points. As Obama’s 2012 field director commented just days before the 2016 election, “They [the Clinton campaign] have built up multiple firewalls to defend themselves.”24

Trump, of course, won all three states and the presidency, and stories about the strength of the Democratic blue wall were quickly replaced by stories of how Trump shattered the blue wall.25 There have been analyses, punditry, and “tell alls” that attempt to explain Clinton’s loss, in general, and, in these three states, in particular.26, 27

Ironically, in the same way that there is a divide between those who say that campaigns matter and those who say they do not, there is also a divide among those who think campaigns can matter. Both in general and in commentary on 2016, some journalists and academics stress the preeminent role played by share (mobilizing one’s partisan voters to turn out and vote in greater numbers) in influencing election results. Still, other analysts and observers are more wedded to the theory that performance (maximizing the support of one’s own partisans and persuading independent and undecided voters to support their side) is the optimal path to winning elections.

By single-mindedly focusing on share (mobilization), performance (persuasion), or fundamentals as the explanatory factor in elections, to the exclusion of almost everything else, some political scientists and journalists are guilty of creating a narrow analytic framework that ignores mounting evidence that all three schools of thought have something important to say about why campaigns matter and how certain candidates win elections. Although all three schools of thought uncover truth about why candidates win and lose elections, none of these schools in and of themselves provides a sufficient theoretical model for explaining election outcomes in contemporary American politics. An analysis of the dance of share and performance in each of these states demonstrates that there is not a single solution or explanation for how campaigns get to or do not get to 50 plus 1.

# Blue Wall Math

As previously stated, Barack Obama won Michigan in 2012 by 9 percentage points. In Michigan in 2016, Donald Trump narrowly won. Hillary Clinton did 6 percentage points worse than Barack Obama garnered in 2012 whereas Trump beat Mitt Romney’s total by 1.5 percentage points. (Because third-party candidates did better in 2016, the losses and gains do not match up.) What happened? What explains the roughly 10 percentage point swing in Michigan and its movement into the Republican column in 2016?

Table 2.8 ![[24.jpeg]]

Obama Michigan total = (.40)(.95) + (.30)(.48) + (.30)(.04) = 53.6%

Romney Michigan total = (.40)(.04) + (.30)(.49) + (.30)(.96) = 45.1%

Table 2.9 ![[25.jpeg]]

Clinton Michigan total = (.40)(.88) + (.29)(.36) + (.31)(.07) = 47.81%

Trump Michigan total = (.40)(.09) + (.29)(.52) + (.31)(.90) = 46.58%

_Source:_ National Election Pool Exit Poll.

Tables 2.8]] and 2.9]] show partisan shares and candidate performance for the last two presidential elections in Michigan. Comparing shares in the tables shows that the partisan shape of the electorate in 2016 (Democrats plus 9) was virtually identical to what it was in 2012 (Democrats plus 10). In both years, Democrats and Republicans also overwhelmingly supported their respective nominees. Still, Obama won Democrats by 91 percentage points (95 percent to 4 percent) in 2012, whereas Clinton’s 79-point margin (88 percent to 9 percent) was 12 points less than Obama’s.

In, 2012, Michigan’s self-described independents split their votes—49 percent for Romney and 48 percent for Obama. In 2016, they swung decisively for Trump as he won them by a margin of 52 percent to 36 percent. The explanation for the swing toward Trump in 2016 in Michigan was performance—Clinton in 2016 did worse among both Democrats and independents than Obama in 2012.

Tables 2.10]] and 2.11]] highlight the relative contributions of each group and each factor over the two elections in Michigan. The tables summarize the share and performance math and show the net percentage points generated for each candidate for each partisan category. For example, Democrats comprised 40 percent of the electorate in 2016 in Michigan and Clinton won the votes of 88 percent of Democrats. Doing the math, multiplying her 88 percent performance among Democrats by their 40 percent share of the Michigan electorate yields 35.2 percentage points from Democrats for Clinton in 2016. This was about 3 percentage points less than the 38 percentage points Obama generated from Michigan Democrats in 2012.

Because Democrats comprised the same share of the electorate in both years, this drop was completely attributable to Clinton’s weaker performance with her own partisans. Furthermore, her weaker performance with independents in Michigan explains another 4 percentage points; Obama generated 14 percentage points from independents in 2012 whereas Clinton only generated 10 percentage points from independents in 2016.

Now take Pennsylvania. The state went from a 5 percentage point Obama victory in 2012 to a 1 percentage point Trump victory in 2016. In Pennsylvania, Clinton did 4 points worse than Obama, and Trump did 2 points better than Romney, with third-party candidates comprising the rest.

Table 2.12 ![[28.jpeg]]

Obama Pennsylvania total = (.45)(.91) + (.20)(.45) + (.35)(.07) = 52.40%

Romney Pennsylvania total = (.45)(.09) + (.20)(.50) + (.35)(.93) = 46.60%

Tables 2.12]] and 2.13]] summarize the partisan shares and candidate performance for 2012 and 2016 in Pennsylvania. Unlike Michigan, however, in Pennsylvania, the shape of the electorate was different in 2016. In 2012, Democrats enjoyed a 10 percentage point lead in partisan identifiers (45 to 35 percent). In 2016, however, that advantage shrunk to 3 percentage points (42 percent to 39 percent).

Table 2.14 ![[30.jpeg]]

Table 2.15 ![[31.jpeg]]

Tables 2.14]] and 2.15]] summarize the share and performance math and document the net percentage points generated for each candidate for each partisan category in Pennsylvania in the two contests. As the tables show, Clinton netted 36.5 points from Democrats—4.5 fewer points than Obama from Democrats. She did perform slightly worse among Democrats—winning Democrats by 76 points (87 to 11) compared to Obama’s 82-point margin (91 to 9) margin. Nevertheless, most of the Trump swing in Pennsylvania can be attributed to the fact that Democratic turnout was lower as compared to 2016 and that the shape of the electorate was less friendly to Democrats in 2016 than it was in 2012.

The math that broke the blue wall was performance in Michigan and share in Pennsylvania. In Wisconsin, it was both. The electorate in the Badger state was less Democratic in 2016 than it was in 2012 and Trump performed much better with independent voters than Romney.

Table 2.16 ![[32.jpeg]]

Obama Wisconsin total = (.37)(.95) + (.31)(.49) + (.32)(.05) = 51.94%

Romney Wisconsin total = (.37)(.04) + (.31)(.47) + (.32)(.95) = 46.45%

Table 2.17 ![[33.jpeg]]

Clinton Wisconsin total = (.35)(.91) + (.30)(.40) + (.34)(.06) = 45.89%

Trump Wisconsin total = (.35)(.07) + (.30)(.50) + (.34)(.90) = 48.05%

_Source:_ National Election Pool Exit Poll.

As Tables 2.16]] and 2.17]] show, both candidates in 2016 performed a little bit worse with their own partisans than Obama and Romney did in 2012. More significantly though, the shape of the electorate went from plus 5 for the Democrats to plus 1 for the Democrats, and Trump performed much better with independents in 2016 than Romney did in 2012. These were the two main drivers that moved Wisconsin from a solid-blue plus-9 win for the Democrats in 2012 to a plus-1 win for the Republicans in 2016.

Tables 2.18]] and 2.19]] help quantify the exact contribution of both factors in Wisconsin. The drop in Democratic share led to a 3 percentage point decline in Clinton’s vote while the fact that independents swung from plus 2 for Obama to plus 10 for Trump accounted for another 3 percentage points. In all three states, when compared to the 2012 results, the campaigns, and the candidates, mattered. Although the fundamentals may have slightly favored the Republican nominee, fundamentals alone are not enough to explain how Trump shattered the Democrats’ blue firewall. It was the complex interplay of the two campaigns that helped effect marginal shifts in share and performance in the three states, and the results helped put a reality TV star and real estate mogul in the White House.

# Political Math Makes Winning Margins

In the end, understanding “the math”—the complex array of factors that determine election outcomes—has implications for those running campaigns and students hoping to understand how campaigns matter. The three schools—fundamentals, share, and performance—all help to explain how candidates fight, win, and lose American elections. But none of these camps by themselves allows for a wide-enough telescope that sufficiently captures the complex angles and dynamics that constitute national election campaigns. In most races, campaign managers are targeting their side’s own voters, seeking to persuade a small minority of swing voters, and trying to depress turnout or win votes from the other side. Their hope is to win an additional 1 or 2 percentage points—a small margin at first blush—but as Al Gore or John Kerry and countless losing congressional candidates and campaign managers well know, even a tiny margin can mean the difference between the Oval Office or a House or Senate seat and nothing. “On the margins is where a lot of the important shit in life happens,” says Jim Bognet, a veteran California Republican campaign manager.28

Campaign managers told us that they based their efforts on the dance of share and performance, with fundamentals always on their minds. Managers also told us that campaigns have the power to increase in small but potentially decisive ways the number and partisan distribution of voters who show up to cast their ballots, or their side’s so-called partisan _share_ of the electorate. In addition, campaign managers told us that campaigns can have the ability to improve their _performance_ among persuadable (or swing) voters, convincing undecided voters to vote for their candidate. They added that campaign activities focused on mobilizing partisans (again, referred to as “share”) or those focused on persuasion (or what we call “performance”) can often be the difference between winning office and losing a tight election, all while paying attention to the fundamentals shaping the electoral terrain.

The campaign managers interviewed for this project repeatedly argued that there is no pure formula—no single play—that guarantees victory. In this chapter, with this argument in mind, we reviewed the scholarly conventional wisdom on campaign effects. We explained how even in a world where fundamental factors explain many elections outcomes, there is room for meaningful campaign effects at the margin. And we aimed to explain the “complicated reality” of campaign effects, especially as these factors unfolded in the blue wall of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin in the 2016 presidential election. The vast majority of campaign managers believe that those campaigns that are able to alter even slightly one side’s share (mobilizing one’s partisans) and performance (persuading swing voters) can be decisive in highly competitive elections. Often, they are right.

# 3 Political Historian and Data Scientist Charting a Path to Victory through Information and Analysis

**E**ver since precinct captains first made handwritten lists of how their neighbors were likely to vote, data have been the DNA of campaign strategy, shaping how campaign managers approach virtually every aspect of their jobs. Campaigns need access to data, research, and other forms of information to determine the mathematical path to victory and to create and deliver campaign messages. Keep in mind the five questions that campaign managers must answer—outlined in our campaign flowchart (see Figure 1.2]] in Chapter 1]]).

1. Who are our target voters?
2. How do we reach them?
3. What do we tell them?
4. How are we doing?
5. What are they doing?

Various sorts of data and research help campaign managers answer these five questions. Armed with data, campaign managers are able to strategize more effectively and envision a winning coalition before any votes are even cast. Data present the candidate with a road map by enabling campaign managers to assess their candidate’s strengths and their opponent’s flaws as well as targeting campaign messages to various voting blocs that both mobilize core supporters and persuade swing voters. For example, as we will discuss in much greater detail, today’s analytically enhanced voter files and computer models can be used to figure out in advance the people who are most likely to vote and for whom, and can suggest the best ways to mobilize and persuade them. More generally, driven by technology, the amount of political data available to today’s campaign managers has exploded. And so have the skills needed to manage those data. Take a look at the job posting for the 2012 Obama campaign that is reproduced in Box 3.1.

Box 3.1 Job Recruitment Listing by the 2012 Obama Campaign

But answering the basic campaign manager questions doesn’t necessarily begin and end with “big data.” Laura Quinn, the cofounder and CEO of Catalist, a leading data services provider to progressive organizations and candidates, said, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. When it comes to data, that’s really true. . . . It’s bringing together the quantitative and the qualitative that really is the strategic exercise. You’ve got to have both. It’s the context along with the statistics that give you the best insight.”1

She reminds us of the value of the data’s context. In this same vein, in a series of after-election “tell alls” or “told you sos,” top Democratic strategists argued that the very same people who hired or filled the positions outlined in the successful and lauded Obama campaign of 2012 became too enamored with the data and models and failed to open their eyes to the differences in the political environment in 2016. They have a point, but we shouldn’t overdo it. Data alone are hardly enough to get campaigns to 50.1 percent of the vote. Campaigns, or at least the best ones, use data in context. They pay attention to data _and_ the fundamentals. They focus on who they are trying to reach, what they are telling them, and how to reach them. They consider what the other side is doing and how their own campaign is faring. We are not arguing that data and analytical skills are incidental, or nonfactors, in determining winners from losers. Data matter. Yet campaigns that fail to address the underlying campaign contexts and address the bigger questions, campaigns that rely so heavily on data, can sometimes miss the political environment and only see what the numbers are telling them.

In sports, fans and critics tend to view the winners as always brilliant and the losers as always stupid. Much the same can be said about how pundits and strategists talk about the aftermath of any hard-fought, consequential campaign. Yet, as in sports, such a binary view is often hyperbolic and wrong. Big data was invented prior to 2012, and the smart data analysts on Obama’s 2012 campaign were not as brilliant as they were portrayed after he won reelection that year. Nor were these same analysts as dumb as conventional wisdom had it in 2016. In fact, part of the 2016 mistake is that not all the campaign’s data tools were used; the Clinton campaign, for instance, didn’t conduct extensive polling. Most importantly, as Stanley Greenberg suggested, the Clinton campaign paid too little attention to the political context.

As campaign manager Jen Pihlaja put it, all campaigns need to rely on “research” from start to finish if they are going to find success, but it must be put into context. The data hat worn by campaign managers involves them learning “the patterns of what’s happened in campaigns before and [about] the voters and the numbers,” she added. All managers need to assess a candidate’s strengths and flaws and figure out who will actually go to the polls.2 This chapter outlines some of the tools campaign managers use to go about doing that.

# The Secret Ballot Problem

There is an apocryphal (we think) story that Haley Barbour, the former Mississippi governor and Republican National Committee chairman, tells about a small Mississippi town in the 1930s and 1940s when the South was solidly Democratic.3 The town prided itself on being solidly Democratic. In fact, in every recent presidential election, there had been only one single Republican vote cast in the whole town, but no one would confess they had done it and—thanks to the secret ballot—there was no way to find out. For years, speculation centered on the town’s aging postmaster who had been appointed by Republican president Calvin Coolidge. Finally, the postmaster passed away. But when the next presidential election rolled around, the single Republican vote was still there. “Damn it!” said the town’s Democratic mayor. “We’ve buried the wrong Republican.”4

The secret ballot is the foundation of American democracy, but it’s a problem for campaign managers who are making voter targeting decisions. When someone votes in an election, the fact that they voted is recorded by election officials on the precinct voter rolls. Although campaigns are able to see who did and did not turn out to vote in the past, they can never really know who someone voted for. So campaigns are forced to make informed guesses. In the past, precinct captains made judgments based on their past conversations with their neighbors. Today, these predictive guesses are more likely to be made by a computer analysis of data drawn from voter data files that are either purchased from a commercial vendor or provided to a campaign by political parties and friendly political organizations.

At the core of virtually all the new techniques used in modern political campaigns is the voter file—lists of registered voters that contain the identities, contact information, demographic characteristics, and voting turnout history of virtually every registered voter in the country. Consider just a few examples of how campaign managers can use the voter file, bulging with data and information, for core campaign tasks: The voter file is the scaffolding of all the “big data” methods of modern campaigns. When it comes to microtargeting, campaign managers use models built off the voter file to prioritize certain voters over others for contact and to better allocate their resources. Furthermore, it is the source employed by on-the-ground field organizers to find and contact the chosen voters. And the file also plays a role in the massive juggernaut that is political advertising. Campaign professionals integrate vast amounts of information on television viewing habits with the voter file to provide insight for media buyers on which shows they should place advertising to target particular sets of voters.5 And, finally, the voter file is used to help find the money to pay for all the things that campaigns must do. In other words, an analysis of a voter file may suggest that certain voters are not turnout targets but that they may be ripe for fundraising appeals.

For the past decade, the two major national parties have also been working on assembling large databases with information about individual voters. These lists contain records of individuals, with information added in to describe their voting patterns and consumer habits. Oftentimes, parties will cold-call voters on their lists to determine whether they are Democrats or Republicans and code them as such in their database. Other times, parties will look to see if a voter voted in an election that had, say, only a Democratic primary and make an educated guess that the voter in question is a Democrat. Once all the information is merged into a master database, it can give campaigns a fairly accurate profile of a voter, so the campaign can determine the probability that a potential voter on the file will vote and the probability that a potential voter will vote Democrat or Republican.

In addition, once the records are established, those voter entries can be merged with other publicly available information about them. For instance, if a voter applied for a hunting license, that voter might be coded as a “hunter” or put in a “pro-gun” category. If the state keeps a database of public teachers, a voter on that list might be coded as “pro–public education.” One campaign manager interviewed for this book was surprised at the sheer number of categories included in his state’s voter target list. His campaign, he said, was able to target motorcycle riders by assuring them that his candidate had fought a law requiring riders to wear helmets. This helps campaigns tailor a message specifically to the voter’s interests and preferences.

# Focus Groups, Polls, and Other Forms of Information Gathering

To assemble a winning coalition, campaign managers also rely on metrics generated from focus groups, public opinion surveys, opposition research, and other sources of information. The insights gleaned from these sources guide campaign strategies and voter outreach efforts. Democratic campaign manager Jen Pihlaja argued that interviews conducted with small groups of voters, especially those who are undecided, independents, and of various ages and backgrounds—focus groups—yield invaluable qualitative information that inform her campaign recommendations. It is useful, she said, when voters watch visual clips of her candidate or view campaign advertisements that have not yet aired. She can learn how voters perceive her candidate and the opposition candidate, learn how effective particular messages are, and gain a window into the minds of persuadable voters, who are among the most crucial audience in a lot of close elections. Pihlaja described how findings from focus groups have helped her present her candidates in a more positive light and figure out how much to use the candidate to communicate with voters directly. In brief, the results of focus groups enable her to maximize the impact of the campaign’s message.6

Although consultants, pollsters, field operatives, and other political specialists tend to be well represented on the typical campaign for high office, the campaign “manager has to be in charge” of the flow of information and the personnel, said Democratic campaign manager Martha McKenna. McKenna, who started as a campaign manager at EMILY’S List, which seeks to elect women leaders to public office, described polls as even more useful than focus groups and said that finding a top-tier pollster is one of the most crucial tasks facing campaign managers. Polls, she argued, help campaign managers analyze candidates’ strengths and flaws, give managers snapshots of a candidate’s unfavorable and favorable ratings, measure popular views of their job performance, and reveal head-to-head matchups. Most managers prefer to see a series of polls showing trends over time (rather than seeing a single snapshot in a particular moment), and campaigns now are even using automated dials to test candidates’ pluses and minuses.7

Not all campaign managers see as much value in public opinion surveys, however. Jim Bognet, who ran David Dewhurst’s 2012 Senate campaign in Texas, cautioned about internal campaign polls conducted by the campaign’s pollster:

> [They] can be frankly so misleading. You know, in the US Senate race, my candidate for twelve or thirteen months of the election was always ahead, but yet he ended up losing the runoff because, among other things, some candidates that are not politically savvy candidates don’t know how to read the whole poll. You know, the topline numbers only show you where you are, not where you’re going. So my candidate saw that he was ahead, was complacent about it, not realizing that the internals showed really bad stuff in the outlook. So I would say that oftentimes polling is misread, by the candidate especially, and it has a very deleterious effect. Polling can unfortunately show the width of support instead of the depth, and unfortunately give a lot of false positives to candidates and cause them to be complacent.8

California-based campaign manager Erik Weigand suspected that one pollster under him had asked leading questions that wound up creating the false appearance that their candidate was performing better than he really was. When polls find unexpected nuggets of data, they often force campaigns to shift their strategy. During one of his races, Weigand received polling that revealed a tighter contest than had been foreseen, and this result, he said, “brought . . . a little bit more . . . attention to the race” and lit a fire under the candidate and his team.9

Research also helps campaign managers craft their messages and decide how to spend the campaign’s limited resources. Indeed, Weigand observed that one of the most crucial pieces of information was “any dirt on other candidates. . . . Most of the research that we did was on just strictly going after our opponents, trying to find out any dirt.” One of Weigand’s campaigns discovered that its opponent had voted to raise taxes, while claiming that the vote occurred late at night and he didn’t know what he was voting for. The research led to an effective line of attack: their opponent became “a sleepy” politician who was unable to “focus when it’s too late.”10

Campaign managers with a deeper, more sophisticated research effort tend to have the upper hand over their rivals. Research involves not just studying up on the other side’s vulnerabilities but also coming to grips with one’s own weaknesses. Candidates are typically uncomfortable with the idea of having others sort through their potential weaknesses, and some campaign managers we interviewed were themselves reluctant to go on the record about examples from a specific campaign in which they had been involved. The process can often require negotiation between the candidate and his or her manager and sometimes can involve lawyers, accountants, and others familiar with the candidate’s personal life. Candidates need to be assured that the counteropposition research dossier or “self-book” is necessary to help their campaigns prepare for and parry attacks from their political opponents. (See [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/07/opinion/campaign-stops/a-users-guide-to-the-dark-art-of-politics.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/07/opinion/campaign-stops/a-users-guide-to-the-dark-art-of-politics.html\) for an excellent description of what self and opposition candidate research is—and is not.)

A self-book was especially important to Jeb Bush’s successful 1998 campaign for Florida governor. This was Bush’s second try for governor. In 1994, the Democratic candidate Lawton Chiles had unleased a series of attacks on Bush’s business career and investments. Anticipating more of the same in 1998, campaign manager Sally Bradshaw and a team of researchers prepared a detailed precampaign document that catalogued likely attacks and responses, along with supporting documentation. “How do we build a sort of firewall for him on those issues?” said Bradshaw. “We spent a tremendous amount of time.”11

Using data to target blocs of the electorate also means sending different messages to different people in different geographic regions. This can be tricky when trying to drive out the candidate’s base because not all members of a specific party might see eye to eye with other factions within the same party. As one Colorado political operative put it, the more bohemian, environmental liberals in Boulder may be completely different from the blue-collar, pro-union Democrats who populate a city like Pueblo. In states with a number of large cities, it is possible to send different messages to different media markets, but this, too, requires segmenting the state and sending distinct messages into distinct markets. This was a strategy employed in 1994, when Lawton Chiles ran for Florida governor and targeted voters by region. Here, too, data shaped the campaign manager’s decision-making process.

> Florida’s a big state, and we broke down a lot of our advertising by geographic region. And clearly the tone and the message in the north Florida campaign, although always consistent, were very different than the way we’d do it in south Florida. I mean, we had Sam Nunn, the senator from Georgia, and lots of people like that doing testimonials for Chiles on the north Florida televisions. And in south Florida, it would be much more urban-centric focus in terms of what our message was. I mean, in Florida, whether it’s a luxury or a burden, you have the ability to talk about several different things in several different markets.12

Koch further mentioned that at the end of the campaign, Chiles brought in both African American and Hispanic consultants to make sure the campaign was properly targeting those groups. That year, Chiles defeated future governor Jeb Bush by barely more than 1 percent.13

Aside from tailoring mass media messages for specific groups (there is a full chapter in this book about advertising targeting) and going door-to-door, campaign managers can use the Internet, direct mail, and mass phone calls (i.e., “robocalls”) to target voters. According to China Gum, campaign manager for Raul Labrador for Congress, direct mail is the best targeting tool because it can be tailored and mailed very specifically. “Direct mail is my preferred method of voter contact,” Gum said. “It’s effective and efficient, as the campaign can target particular groups with a more defined message.”14

Direct mail is usually done through a mail vendor, which will help design the piece and mass mail it. Sometimes, a campaign may want to obtain its own postal mailing code to receive cheaper bulk rates; other times, a mail vendor will simply use their code.

One longtime campaign manager suggested doing direct mail early in the campaign, to cut through the clutter:

> I’m a huge direct mail fan, but I’m also a huge microtargeting fan. I like getting mail that’s tailored to me. I like seeing that you may be Obama or you may be Bill Nelson, but that you realize that I’m in north Florida.
> 
> I’ll give you an example. It was a statewide, but I had regional mail pieces that were trying to build a hospital. You find an issue that has regional appeal. And in north Florida, there was this big issue in these seven particular counties about trying to have a regional medical center. Well, we mailed those seven counties about that issue. Nobody six counties away gives a rat’s butt about it, but it mattered to those seven counties. It takes time. It’s work. It may cost you a little more.
> 
> Or maybe it’s point number one and point number two are the same issue around the state, but point number three—it is a regional point. So you’re doing a gang print. But point number three is different on this set other than that one, you know. But even more than that, and what I’m saying to you is more theory than I ultimately practice because sometimes the hassle of it becomes too much. I love early direct mail. I do not like late direct mail when every judge candidate, every mosquito district candidate’s in the mailbox.15

As discussed earlier in this chapter, targeting voters through the Internet is much more art than science—and it’s likely to remain that way for the foreseeable future. Large search engines are just beginning to explore the ways specialized content can be delivered to viewers:

> [Campaigns are] getting a lot better at targeting people on the Internet. Before, I feel like it was more of a buckshot. And now, it’s a pinpoint shot at certain demographics and whatnot.
> 
> When you think about it, I don’t think it would be long before you see campaign ads on Hulu, you know? I actually recently opted not to buy cable at my apartment. I just have broadcast TV and I’ve got an Xbox that streams Hulu through it. So I can watch my shows on Hulu and I’m getting the same sort of commercials as television. There’s not a wide variety of commercials on there and I don’t think it’ll be long before we start seeing more people spending money on commercials on Hulu and you start seeing political campaigns putting commercials on there.16

Finally, campaign managers can deploy robocalls in which a company is paid to automatically dial voters and leave a voice message with them. These prerecorded messages are oftentimes notable people supporting a candidate’s campaign—such as Bill Clinton endorsing a Democratic candidate. Some campaign managers, however, think robocalls are a nuisance to voters and can backfire:

> Robocalls are dead thirty days out, maybe forty-five days out. Just don’t even use them. People are pissed they’re getting so many of them. And that’s not just the urban areas. Now it’s more event-driven. It’s more “push 1 if you’d like to be on an e-mail list” or get a polling sample. I’m trying to collect data.
> 
> It’s a waste of money unless it’s Bill Clinton or Bono or some rock star. I still get seniors [who say], “You’re not going to believe who called and left me a message.” Really? Bill Clinton called you today? Jesse Jackson. Yeah, you know, and the candidates cannot exist without them.17

# Who Are Our Target Voters?

Chapter 2]] reviewed the fundamental factors that determine election outcomes. The most fundamental factor that drives all subsequent campaign decisions is the composition of the likely electorate—who will show up at the voting booth and in what numbers. But, according to Republican campaign veteran David Carney, a New Hampshire native who got his first political paycheck in college while working on John Sununu’s unsuccessful US Senate campaign in 1980, “You’d be surprised how many times I’ve asked candidates, managers, consultants how many votes they need on election day and they don’t know. I mean, they can’t give you a number, like ‘I need 2 million and one votes out of the 4 million votes on election day from 7 million people registered to vote.’” Once the campaign knows that number, Carney said, they can then begin to break it down by groups of voters and by smaller units of geography. Ultimately, the campaign can target individual voters on the voter file.18

Campaign managers must start their races by trying to determine what that composition will need to look like for them to win the election. They attempt to understand how they might influence that composition and where their most plausible path to victory lies. Campaign managers have to find their universe of voters and determine where their votes will come from. More often it starts with mastering the recent voting history of the local political geography. As political pros often tell us, the best predictor of the next election is what happened in past elections.19

Take a look at the following table. The information comes from a firm that analyzes voter lists and looks at the voter file in Florida. Florida is a state where one has to register by party and where it is possible to examine in which elections particular voters take part. Although registered is not the same as self-identified partisanship, you can assume that 90 percent is a baseline level of performance or loyalty proportion for registered voters. In other words, around 90 percent of registered Democrats will vote for a Democratic candidate and 90 percent of Republicans will vote for a Republican candidate.

Table 3.1 ![[37.jpeg]]

A first step for a campaign manager would be to use these data to sketch out a path to victory. They have to determine what turnout and share will be (or what they need it to be) for each of the voter groups and what sort of performance they need out of each of the groups. As you can see by looking at the table, Democrats have a structural advantage in presidential election years and Republicans have a structural advantage in midterm elections. This is because “Frequent voters” tend to be a little bit more Republican whereas more casual voters tend to be a bit more Democratic. For a Republican to win in a presidential year, he or she would have to do well with independents or get a disproportionate number of casual Republican voters to the polls. For a Democrat to win Florida in a midterm year, he or she would have to do well with independents and convince a sizeable number of Democrats who typically come out only in presidential years to come out in a midterm.

# How Do We Reach Them?

Ask campaign professionals how they reach their target voters, and most of them will start talking about television or digital advertising. Laura Quinn, who has spent her career working for Democrats and progressive causes, is different. She is more likely to talk about old-fashioned phone calls and door knocks instead of electronic media. For her, campaigns begin with making a list of voters and putting them in order from the most likely supporter to the least likely. “I really like to have all my lists lined up from the best guy down,” said Quinn. “I’m calling my best prospect and working down the list.”20 When Quinn talks about phone calling and door knocking, she can sound old-school and old-fashioned. She admits that some of the young Democrats she works with have compared her to Granny, the shotgun-toting, country-come-to-town character from the 1960s hit sitcom _The Beverly Hillbillies_.21

![[38.jpeg]]

Figure 3.1 Campaign Communications Channels

In fact, Quinn is far from being old-fashioned. She’s the chief executive officer of Catalist, one of the country’s most successful political technology and data agencies. The lists she talks about getting “lined up” are drawn from her data files that include almost every adult in America. Catalist’s mission is “to provide progressive organizations with the data and services needed to better identify, understand, and communicate with the people they need to persuade and mobilize.”22 Headquartered in modest offices in downtown Washington, the firm’s clients include Democratic candidates, Democratic campaign committees, and independent advocacy organizations that typically support Democratic candidates.

If Quinn is old-fashioned, it’s her belief in the political power of direct contact, one of our five campaign communications channels (see Figure 3.1]]). Despite words like _cutting-edge_ and _dynamic modeling_ found on the Catalist website, Laura Quinn holds firm to the belief that “at the end of the day, the exercise is still an exercise in persuasion.”23

Catalist provides data and analytics services to campaigns, civic organizations, and advocacy groups to get their message to broad target audiences, but in the end, the data always point them toward individuals. Specific unique transactions like voting history, civic information, and commercial behavior all add up to understanding people and their participation in civic life, Quinn said.24

One of the biggest changes Quinn has seen in the past thirty years is the exponential growth in the amount of information available to political marketers. It has increased tremendously due to cheaper data processing and advances in technology, allowing political organizations, commercial entities, and companies like Catalist to listen and understand people in a more refined way. This change has given groups the capacity to target messages to subsections of populations in ways they never have before. However, Quinn said, “It requires more discipline now to personalize a message, but still to have it in service to a larger narrative. . . . You’ve got to be saying something in a way that meets them where they live and demonstrates you really have been listening to them.”25

Although this idea of personalization is not new to political campaigns, the capacity to do so has expanded not only horizontally to a greater number of campaigns but also deeper to a more minute, individual level. Today, state or party voter files can be augmented with door-to-door responses and then quickly categorized, all through the same company and program. Yet, Quinn said, “It’s even more challenging now because the expectation of personalization has gone way up.”26 With continually clearer _resources/books//Inside Campaigns; Elections Through the Ey - Will Feltus of individual voters, all types of organizations have begun using these personal connections in marketing their products and ideas.

Even in the political off-season, Catalist keeps up with millions of personal political behaviors not only for nonprofits and advocacy groups still working but also to maintain an up-to-date universe of data—a feature that sets them apart from other voter file vendors who gather their database just before election cycles. Nonetheless, Quinn made it clear that it is not data alone that carry you across the finish line but insisted, “You have to be able to ask the data the right questions. You have to see the numbers against the context.” She continued to explain that advances in data storage and analytics isn’t the end, but instead that “bringing together the quantitative and the qualitative that really is the strategic exercise . . . that gives you the best insight.”27

From the first computers and fax machines in campaign headquarters, campaign managers have had to adjust and learn new technology and techniques to keep a clear path to victory. Yet campaign managers across the country agree that it’s the campaign that uses the combination of historical knowledge and cutting-edge technology that wins. Quinn recognized that there may be “a whole new set of tools” but that “ultimately the same sort of ability to bring qualitative context to the numbers . . . that’s not going to change at all.”28

# What Do We Tell Them?

Mitch Daniels didn’t want to waste money putting ineffective ads on television. Back in early 1983, Daniels—who would later become governor of Indiana and president of Purdue University—had just become the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and was charged with protecting the GOP’s narrow majority in the US Senate. Daniels was looking for a way to test political television ads before they were aired. In the 1984 elections, Daniels would be responsible for allocating millions of television advertising dollars to Republican Senate campaigns across the country, and he wanted a research-based method for evaluating the countless TV spots that would be produced by campaign media teams in key Senate races. Daniels made it clear to Republican Senate campaign managers that he wouldn’t release any money to air a spot unless it passed muster with his political ad testing system.

But first Daniels had a problem: In 1983, there was no systematic research methodology for testing political TV ads. Some campaigns, when they had the money or the time, would screen spots for focus groups of eight to twelve voters, but Daniels considered focus groups too subjective and unstructured. Watching the focus group behind a one-way mirror, the campaign media consultant could usually convince campaign management that their spots “would work” even in the face of negative feedback from group participants. Daniels wanted a less subjective approach and thought he could find his answer on Madison Avenue where large consumer advertisers used more rigorous quantitative methods to “copy test” alternative creative executions before they invested millions in a new media campaign. Copy testing methods were either “forced exposure,” where ads were shown to people in groups or individually, or “in-home exposure” where test spots were aired in television programs followed by telephone interviews with those who said they had watched the program. Both methods had advantages and drawbacks, and a large consumer marketer was likely to use both.

To help develop and manage his new political ad testing program, Daniels hired Paul Curcio, a young Madison Avenue advertising executive. Daniels and Curcio prepared requests for proposals (RFPs) and sent them to several consumer ad research firms as well as to some Republican polling companies. Looking at the responses, they first discarded the in-home exposure method because of the long turnaround time. It could take several days to arrange this kind of research, get the test ads on the air, and then conduct telephone surveys with target voters who might have seen the test ads. Political campaigns needed a much faster turnaround time than did consumer advertisers. Daniels and Curcio would have to go with forced exposure.

The winner of the contract wasn’t located in New York City or Washington, D.C., but in Detroit, Michigan. Detroit was the home of Market Opinion Research headed by pollster Robert Teeter. Teeter’s firm had just completed a successful 1982 focus group program testing ads for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). The NRCC methodology emphasized the use of preprinted questionnaires. Instead of beginning with focus group participants talking about ads they’d just seen, the NRCC focus groups started out with a written questionnaire. Focus groups were given questionnaires with 0 to 100 thermometer scales printed on them. Participants used the scales to rate TV, radio, and print advertising on believability, likability, information content, and whether the ad would have a positive or negative impact on other viewers. Written questions asked what the main message of the ad was and allowed participants to comment on why they liked or disliked the ad. Other thermometers were completed before the groups began and after the groups were finished to measure shifts in attitudes that might be attributable to the advertising. No discussion or comments were allowed until the end of the sessions to keep participants from influencing each other.

Building on their 1982 experience, Teeter’s Detroit ad test team won Daniels’s and Curcio’s 1983–1984 Republican Senate contract by proposing to take the newest data processing technology to each ad test site. The Compaq had just been released in the spring of 1983 and would become the first commercially successful portable computer. A statistician and computer programmer on Teeter’s staff, Dr. James Leiman, wrote a custom data entry and data analysis program that would run on the Compaq and on the IBM personal computers used at the NRSC Capitol Hill headquarters in Washington. Ad test participants would complete their written questionnaires. These would be immediately collected and manually entered into the traveling Compaq. The results would be assessed that night by Curcio and the ad test team and then the results delivered to Mitch Daniels at NRSC headquarters.

Paul Curcio, the ad tester, is now a political ad maker. He remembers that the NRSC tests were most useful for pointing out potential problem ads—the “dogs” that shouldn’t be aired. Negative spots always received lower scores than positive spots, although that didn’t necessarily disqualify the spots from being aired, particularly if the negative ad was seen as believable and people could remember the ad’s message when they were telephoned to measure message recall after the tests.

One thing that quickly became apparent was that the ad makers weren’t always big fans of the ad testing process, and Curcio said that’s true today: “It may be mildly uncomfortable for the media consultant to have their client sitting behind the mirror and looking at the data and having these people respond poorly.” Some media consultants feel that their judgment is more valuable than how fifty or so target voters respond to an ad in an artificial environment. “It’s a threat to their power,” said Curcio.

![[42.jpeg]]

**Evolving data technologies have enabled new political research methods**. In 1983, the new portable Compaq computer made it possible for traveling Republican ad test teams to enter focus group data on-site, resulting in much faster turnaround times. Called a “suitcase computer,” the Compaq weighed more than thirty pounds and relied on floppy magnetic disks for data storage.

This was followed in the mid-1980s by the development of the Perception Analyzer, a handheld dial device used by ad test participants. This eliminated the need for manual entry of paper questionnaires and gave researchers the ability to gauge moment-to-moment reactions to political television ads and radio ads.

Dials are still in use today, although the development of low-cost video streaming has made Internet ad tests a viable alternative to more expensive in-person advertising research.

# How Are We Doing?

“How am I doing?” was the well-known political slogan of three-term New York mayor Ed Koch, who would ask the question of city residents he encountered on sidewalks and subways.29 Personal feedback—from voters, political activists, donors, and others—has always been offered to candidates and campaign staffers. Whether welcome or not, word of mouth remains a key source of political information, particularly for smaller campaigns that are unable to afford regular polling.

Word-of-mouth feedback has been augmented with the growth of the Internet and social media, which offer campaign managers new ways to continually monitor the vital signs of their campaigns. This can be as simple as tracking daily visits to the campaign website or watching the trend of online donations. Campaigns can tally and track positive and negative comments on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. More sophisticated methods involve the computer-assisted collection and analysis of tens of thousands of daily news items, commentaries, blog posts, social media interactions, and other content harvested from the Internet. This type of analysis increasingly is used by consumer marketers to monitor positive and negative “buzz” about their brands and can also be used by political campaigns that are able to afford it.

Polling remains the primary method used by campaign management to answer the “How are we doing?” question. Although a consumer marketer can track daily sales volumes, the political marketer is left to ask a sample of voters, “If the election was being held today, would you vote for Candidate A or Candidate B?” Polls are a staple of American politics, and the hiring of a polling firm is seen as one of the most important decisions a candidate and campaign manager will make. Pollsters tend to be one of the first consulting hires in campaigns, and the relationship between pollster and candidate is comparable to that between a physician and a patient who asks, “Doctor, how am I doing?”

Pollsters tell candidates how they are faring in the head-to-head ballot matchup, but they must also be able to describe what voters know about the candidate and his or her opponent, whether they like or dislike them, and why. Pollsters test potential messages for or against a candidate; ask if the respondent has seen or read any news or advertising about a candidate; and collect data on the respondent’s issue positions, demographics, and past voting behaviors.

The first campaign pollster of prominence was Lou Harris, who worked for over 240 political campaigns from 1956 to 1963, including the 1960 presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy.30 In his 1992 book _The Superpollsters_, author David W. Moore says that the rise of the modern pollster actually began in the 1970s.31 In those days, before the introduction of the personal computer, there were high barriers of entry into the polling business. A polling firm had to have its own mainframe computer, its own sampling department, its own phone facility, data entry department, and other support staff. As a consequence, there were only a handful of political pollsters. Democrats like Peter Hart and Pat Caddell along with Republicans Robert Teeter and Richard Wirthlin became campaign superstars known both for the accuracy of their data and for their sage ability to interpret the results to the political advantage of their clients.

More recently, political polling has fallen on harder times. As people have moved away from the use of the traditional at-home landline telephone, they have also become more reluctant to share their opinions with strangers.32

According to Dave Carney, traditional random selection polling methods are increasingly being supplemented by tracking a campaign’s contacts with its targeted voter file. “Say you get 20,000 field reports a week, 20,000 or 30,000 online sign-ups a week, maybe 1,000 new donors a week,” said Carney, talking about his work with Governor Greg Abbott’s campaign in Texas. On top of that, the campaign’s pollsters did 1,000 weekly interviews with voters drawn from the voter file. “That’s 50,000 to 60,000 new data points a week,” said Carney. Based on the new data points, each week the campaign would run statistical models, called Monte Carlo simulations, to predict likely election outcomes. “Each week the models will get smarter,” said Carney. In the closing weeks of the campaign, there were 1,000 interviews conducted each day with respondents drawn from the campaign voter file. The data let Carney know not only where they stood in the head-to-head ballot but also allowed them to target their volunteer contacts and messaging more effectively.33

# What Are Our Opponents and Allies Doing?

To answer this question, campaign managers use what they often call competitive research or competitive tracking. Competitive research data can come from many sources, ranging from macrodata about advertising spending and ad occurrences down to microtracking what the opposing candidate says or does at public campaign appearances.34

“Competitive [research] used to be a lot simpler,” says Brian Baker, remembering his first campaign job as a twenty-two-year-old junior aide in Senator Bob Dole’s unsuccessful 1996 challenge to incumbent president Bill Clinton.35 “If we knew what the Clinton campaign and [Reform Party candidate] Perot campaign were doing, plus maybe the DNC [Democratic National Committee] and a couple of labor unions, that was pretty much the whole competitive picture.”36

By 2014, the competitive picture was a lot more complicated and harder to see. At the time, Baker was running the Ending Spending Action Fund, one of the larger and more highly regarded super political action committees (PACs) that had sprung up across the country after a 2010 US Supreme Court ruling in the case of _Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission_. The ruling made it legal for individuals, corporations, and unions to fund, out of their own pockets, unlimited independent expenditures relating to campaigns and candidates. These super PACs could run ads or do any of the other things the campaigns were doing themselves. The catch was that the independent super PACs were prohibited from communicating with a candidate or their campaign. Super PACs could, however, communicate with one another. The Ending Spending Action Fund was established in 2010 and initially funded by Joe Ricketts, a Wyoming resident and founder of Ameritrade, the online stock trading giant. Baker, an attorney, had served as the group’s executive director since the group was launched.

The proliferation of both Democratic and Republican super PACs by 2014 was making Baker’s job more difficult. “Just like the other super PACs, we were tracking what everybody else was doing in sixteen or seventeen Senate and House key races,” said Baker, who had to make recommendations about where and when the Ending Spending Action Fund should spend their money, primarily on television, radio, and digital advertising or on direct mail and direct voter contact operations.37 To do this, Baker needed intelligence on where other super PACs and the campaigns they supported were spending or planning to spend their money.

Some of the information Baker could get by talking with the managers of other friendly Republican-allied super PACs. “I needed to know where the money was going,” said Baker, who was looking for opportunities or “holes” where his super PAC might make a difference. To get a more detailed picture, he tapped into the informal intelligence network maintained by political media buyers and media sellers, like television stations, radio stations, cable operators, and digital media vendors. “One of the secrets of political advertising is that there aren’t that many secrets,” says Baker.38

Unlike consumer advertising spending, most political advertising spending is a matter of public record. Federal regulations have long required television and radio broadcasters to place political orders in their “public file.” Local cable operators followed the same practice. In 2012, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandated that television operators put their public files online.39

In fact, the political media industry was well ahead of the Federal Election Commission (FEC). For years, political ad sellers and buyers have used informal e-mail networks to collect and share information about the dollar amounts of orders placed. Because political media buys will ultimately become public information, media sales representatives for decades have shared the dollar amounts of Republican buys with Democratic media agencies and vice versa. The total dollar amounts of television and radio buys are available up to several days before the actual detailed order appears in the public file where reports must list the names of programs purchased and the cost of each spot. In the political media business, getting these early dollar spending estimates is known as getting “the competitive.” Political media agencies compile competitive reports and provide them to their clients.

Competitive ad spending reports have joined polling as must-have daily information for campaign managers. “If the polls are the first thing you look at, competitive is the next thing,” said Baker, who received daily e-mail reports of new ad spending. The proliferating number of political advertisers made the job more difficult in 2014. “In most of these big races there might be a dozen or more players [to track],” said Baker. The reports Baker received would break down spending amounts by media type and media market. “The forecasted spending amounts were always changing,” said Baker. “For example, a candidate we were supporting might have only a light media buy in place for the next two or three weeks. So we would go in and start spending to help them and then suddenly another super PAC opposing our candidate would place a buy for the next two weeks and we’d have to rethink. It never stopped.”40

Campaigns and their allied super PACs cannot directly communicate with one another. But they can indirectly signal what they are planning to do by placing media orders that will be picked up and circulated in competitive tracking reports. “Of course your opponents are going to see it too, but that’s the way it’s done these days,” said Baker. The political press has gotten in on the competitive game, and reports of new media buys appear daily in insider publications like _Politico_ and _National Journal_. Some campaigns try to game the system by placing large orders for future dates, hoping to generate favorable press. “Some [political advertisers] try to look bigger than they are by placing a large future order but they don’t send a check,” said Baker. “Unless you actually send money, the order doesn’t mean [anything]. You can’t reserve [political media time] without actually paying cash in advance.”41

In 2016, competitive information on television advertising may have provided an incomplete picture. Although Clinton was dominating the airways on broadcast and cable television, the Trump campaign had a much bigger presence on digital than anybody realized. Lots of attention is now being paid to improving the ways that digital advertising is captured (More on competitive tracking in Chapter 7]]).

# Microtargeting with Big Data

Many of the managers we talked to argued that technological advances empowered them to develop and deliver specific and highly personalized messages to particular segments of the electorate in more efficient ways than ever. Managers can thus appeal to voters’ highest priorities on a whole range of issues.

Jarryd Gonzales, the George W. Bush victory coordinator in 2004 (CA), says microtargeting has enabled campaigns to slice the electorate into such granular detail that he can reach specific voting blocs with messages tailored to their passions.

> Before microtargeting, most campaigns would send voters direct mail with the following mind-set: “This is a Republican primary, we have limited resources to identify voters by issue, so let’s blanket the district with a 40,000 piece pro-life or antitax mailer.”
> 
> The problem with that mind-set is that it is terribly flawed. Not all Republicans care about that issue enough to actually motivate voters to go to the polls. Microtargeting dramatically improves the way campaigns talk to voters. By overlaying voter history and consumer marketing data, a campaign can look at the same 40,000 voters and find clusters of them that are grouped together by issues they care about. Based upon this data, campaigns can send direct mail to voters that will connect with them personally. Microtargeting can be expensive, but so is not communicating effectively with voters. In the end, the cost to acquire a vote will be less if a campaign is armed with better ways to connect with voters.42
> 
> —Jarryd Gonzales, victory coordinator, George W. Bush for President, 2004 (CA)

Julie Petrick, who ran Gary Peters’s 2008 campaign for Congress in Michigan, underscores the increasingly data-driven nature of voter targeting:

> We ran a really aggressive direct voter targeting program on both the paid and volunteer sides. And we started very early. One of the tools we used to identify our targets for the field program was the VAN (Voter Activation Network), which was populated with data from the Michigan secretary of state. It was a presidential year, so we knew we wanted to communicate to Democratic voters and make sure they voted down the ballot for our candidate.
> 
> Gary had been in the state senate, and he had run for attorney general, losing statewide by less than 5,000 votes. And then he had been lottery commissioner for seven years. So he definitely had a strong presence among Democratic voters. But considering we were trying to unseat a 16-year incumbent, we needed to communicate with a large bloc of persuadable voters. So we targeted a considerable part of our grassroots effort, which was door-to-door canvassing and phones, to those persuadable voters. That program started very early—we started building it in February, and we were out knocking on doors consistently from March to election day.
> 
> In 2004, we used an Access database to manage the local voter file—and we blew up maps on copy machines. Then in 2005 and 2006, we walked door-to-door with PalmPilots. But back then, different states were using different technology to access their individual voter files. Now we have a national voter file and the VAN, which cuts its own turf and targets its own maps. So in less than a decade, we went from blowing up driving maps on a copy machine to using a national voter file that you can access from your iPhone.43
> 
> —Julie Petrick, campaign manager, Gary Peters for Congress, 2008 (MI)

There certainly have been major advances in campaign technology, but the terrain is shifting yearly, and some campaigns and campaign managers are having trouble keeping up. Learning about what data are available and learning how to use it in context are crucial skills. But, as many campaign managers reminded us, the avalanche of data can distract. A campaign manager needs to make sure that there is motion and not only movement and that the data being delivered to him or her help answer the five questions fundamental to any campaign. As Steve Bell, who ran Heather Wilson’s campaign for Congress in 1998, argued, the key to winning an election still requires “find[ing] every person who’ll vote for you, identify that person precisely, and make sure that person gets to the polls. Not much has changed.”44

# 4 Entrepreneur and Chief Financial Officer Launching and Sustaining the Campaign

# The Startup

The early days of a campaign are hectic, intense, and crucial. A manager must plan, budget, hire, raise funds, and strategize, doing all these things simultaneously. The strength of a campaign’s fundraising operation often determines the kind and number of core activities (persuasion and mobilization) the campaign can undertake. Although money alone does not determine election outcomes, campaigns need enough resources to reach voters with their messages, and in close contests, the amount of money each side accumulates—and how each side spends its money—can shape the political landscape and even affect the results on the margins. And, as Chapter 2]] illustrated, the margins matter. Structure and finance can have an outsized effect on the closest races, ratcheting up the pressure on campaign managers to excel as the entrepreneur who must lead in both fields.

In short, campaigns are super-costly start-ups—and start-ups need plans; budgets; staff; and, most of all, financing. Consider how Ken Mehlman saw the role of money and structure in President George W. Bush’s 2004 reelection campaign. In early 2002, Bush invited Mehlman, his White House political director, to Camp David for the weekend. Mehlman had talked to Karl Rove, Bush’s chief strategist, and Rove had “explored me a little bit to see if I was interested [in running Bush’s reelection campaign] because if I wasn’t, the last thing you want to do is have the president be told no by some guy he invited to Camp David for the weekend.”1

Mehlman agreed to manage the campaign on two conditions. Mehlman insisted that he—not anyone in the White House, not even Rove—must have the power to hire and fire everyone on the campaign and that he alone would have the authority to sign off on campaign expenses:

> Look, I get how the world works . . . I don’t need my name in the paper. I don’t need to be identified as the guy who is calling the shots. I don’t actually love that stuff. But if you were deciding who’s hired and what’s spent and everyone knows that and you cannot be vetoed, then you’re going to be in a good place. And that was important to me.2

He wasn’t looking for the high-profile status many campaign managers attain during national elections; he primarily wanted “to be a good manager.”

“‘You’re smart to ask for that,’” Bush replied. “‘You got it.’”3

Mehlman did not believe that money alone, or simply controlling the campaign’s purse strings, was how he could lead Bush’s campaign to victory. Just outraising Kerry hardly guaranteed a win for the Republican side. But Mehlman did believe that the money mattered. He believed that the money—if he could spend it effectively on core campaign activities—would indeed affect the margins of a race that was likely to be close.

In March 2003, Mehlman launched the campaign. He opened the campaign’s bank account and began hiring people to help in the enormous undertaking of reelecting a sitting president. He crafted a budget and laid out a month-by-month spending plan. He spent several months studying both the 2000 Bush-Gore campaign and past reelection campaigns. Funding the campaign and spending the right resources in the right areas to maximize Bush’s chances of success were crucial early steps for the campaign, in Mehlman’s view.4

When he made a hire, he typically presented the new employee with a budget and offered the chance to change it. He sat down with his employees every month to figure out how they did against their budget. He called the budget a “critical” element that forced the campaign to put its intentions in writing—to make hard choices. He explained the reality:

> [I] probably spent 20 percent of my time on budgeting. . . . I viewed my job as being the CEO of a company whose business happened to be politics. First and foremost was not politics. It was not, you know, schmoozing. It was CEO. It was leading a business. It was management. The most important part of my job was management.5

Mehlman eventually hired a whole team to comb through the budget “religiously” and “relentlessly.” And his pioneering efforts at microtargeting, which were discussed in Chapter 3]], were made possible partly by the campaign’s successful budgeting, fundraising, and spending decisions. Combined, the Bush and Kerry campaigns raised more than $880 million, shattering all records up until then.

Mehlman’s tactics—enabled by his ability to spend in the right places on activities that mattered—were highly effective on the campaign’s margins, as the narrow election results (also described in Chapter 3]]) illustrated. By spending wisely, Mehlman helped make it possible for Bush to eke out a victory in his hard-fought reelection campaign.6

And by standing up to the organization as the campaign’s undisputed entrepreneurial leader, Mehlman also supported and enacted the activities that helped Bush do what his father couldn’t do—win a second term. Mehlman described himself as an “obsessive planner.” He figured that if he could take care of 80 percent of the issues that could come up in the next week, then he could devote his full energy to “the 20 percent that needed to be decided during the week and the rest could be executed.”7 Although some political scientists have shed fresh light on how events outside the candidates’ control (economic conditions, war and peace, a candidate’s background) are key drivers of presidential election results, campaign managers reveal that, in primaries and general elections alike, their entrepreneurial activities and spending decisions give them some often-unseen leverage over the fate of their races.8 By establishing the infrastructure and ensuring that the campaign has adequate resources to carry out their priorities, campaign managers influence the campaign’s strategy, tactics, and direction as well as help their candidates to victory.

# The Money Campaign

Although this was a presidential race and budgets were exponentially higher than in congressional, state-level, or local elections, budget and money are reality. The fact is that almost all campaigns cost a lot of money, sometimes tens of millions of dollars, and the core question of this book—how do campaigns matter?—is really just another way of asking, how and when does money matter? As you’ll remember from Chapter 2]], political scientists often argue for a variety of reasons that campaigns have minimal to null effects on the election result, especially presidential contests.

Thus, we are left with this paradox: Campaign managers put a big premium on fundraising, describing it as their most vital job. And candidates, many of whom detest “dialing for dollars,” spend inordinate amounts of time doing just that, what is known as “call time,” talking to potential donors, urging them to give as much money as legally possible. At the same time, some political scientists say money tends to flow to the side that already has the upper hand and that in any case, each side has enough resources (especially in presidential general election races) to cancel each other’s activities out.9 Both political scientists and campaign managers provide us with important insights on the effects of campaigns on election results—and the role of campaigns in our electoral democracy. Scholars have demonstrated that money is not the decisive factor and that the most well-funded campaigns don’t necessarily win the election. At the same time, campaign managers point out, money funds the activities that can, and often do, give one side or another a marginal advantage over the opposition, and because campaigns are often decided on the margins, the money advantage can have a real impact on election day. Thus, the question is not simply how much money a campaign is able to raise but, more importantly, how effectively that money is being spent, which can influence the margins of competitive elections. Thus, the ability to raise enough sums; budget wisely; identify a campaign’s spending priorities; execute; and efficiently find, reach, mobilize, and persuade voters—all of which requires money—affects election margins.

In Chapter 1]], we showed you a chart that highlighted how presidential and congressional campaigns were now in total costing many billions of dollars. Thus, with no end in sight to the fundraising arms race, another way to think about the impact of money on campaigns is, what’s all that money actually buying? Why are campaign managers so focused on fundraising as their highest priority? Money is _not_ the primary driver of election outcomes; money does not buy elections. Money ultimately doesn’t predetermine which side loses and which side celebrates. As political scientists have demonstrated, the person with the most money often gets beat, and wealthy candidates using their own money (so-called self-funders), such as Meg Whitman of California, outspend their opponents by large sums, but more often than not, they, too, lose their elections.10 At the electoral margins, having enough money to fund the campaign’s core activities, laid out in the campaign’s budget, can often move the electorate in decisive ways in close elections.

To be competitive in presidential, congressional, many statewide, and even local races, campaigns need to raise enough money to find and reach their voters and, most crucially, must spend that money on activities that are likely to influence the electoral margins to their advantage. Thus, when assessing campaigns, campaign managers think not only in terms of _how much_ they need to raise but also in terms of _what_ they are spending their money on. How are my core activities influencing voters? Have my spending decisions reached and engaged the electorate? How am I doing?

Campaign managers we interviewed said that grit, hard work, and grassroots excitement are important but hardly sufficient. Campaign managers must put together a budget, make tough spending choices, and assemble a staff and structure to affect the vote margins.

Although the budget decisions and spending priorities of each campaign vary from race to race, all managers are seeking to answer the five questions featured in the campaign model (see Chapter 1]]). They must decide who they need, how they reach them, what they will say, how their campaign is doing, and what “they,” including outside groups, are doing. But understanding the political climate, identifying their campaign’s targets, figuring out the right mix of persuasion and mobilization activities, crafting a message, delivering the message to their targets, and ensuring that their voters go to the polls are all tasks that require money—_a lot of money_. Furthermore, managers need to establish a solid organizational foundation led by dedicated professionals to carry out these activities. Mark Harris, Pat Toomey’s 2010 Pennsylvania Senate campaign manager, said that “the tricky thing about campaigns is that you need to both build and sail the ship at the same time.”11

Whether the candidate is running for president or a seat on the city council, managers must establish the campaign organization and have enough funds on hand to support the campaign’s core activities. In 2007, David Plouffe told then senator Barack Obama and a group of his friends that any campaign they ran would need to “launch a cutting-edge website, recruit talented senior staff, develop a plan and budget.” Plouffe wrote in his memoirs that the campaign manager’s job “encompasses a lot more than just developing electoral theories, obsessing about metrics, and spending lots of money creatively.”12

> It also requires dealing with myriad personnel issues, mediating internal disputes, and worrying about things like office air conditioning costs and how much to reimburse staff for mileage—stuff I had not had to worry about for a long time but remembered as a grind. The manager has to be on top of every aspect of the campaign—when the candidate calls, he or she can’t say, “I haven’t been paying much attention to (fill in the blank). Let me talk to the staffer who has.” As I had told Obama, there are no shortcuts. The manager’s ass is on the line every minute of every day. The campaign has to be all-consuming.13

# How Money Drives Decisions

If money buys the stuff that can win elections, then campaign managers must write detailed budgets reflecting a campaign’s goals and priorities. One campaign manager we spoke with was concerned when he joined a campaign and found the budget was simply scribbled on the back of a napkin. One of the first things he did was identify spending priorities, write a specific budget for each month and quarter, and determine how they wanted to spend for the rest of the campaign.14

As we discussed in Chapter 2]], pure claims that money buys elections or that money is inconsequential miss the boat. Campaigns can matter at the margin, and none of the things campaigns do to influence the shape and performance of the electorate can be done without resources. Money matters and budgets matter because margins matter; money funds the key activities that enable campaigns to find, mobilize, and persuade voters in the hopes of moving the margins a bit in their favor—and answering some of the core questions (Who are our target voters? How do we reach them? What do we say?) will drive virtually all campaign decision making. As entrepreneurs, the campaign managers we interviewed recognized that money was vital to launching and then sustaining the operation.

Although flush campaigns are not always victorious, financially strapped campaigns are typically losing campaigns. Campaigns don’t need to raise more money than the other side to win, but they do need to raise enough to be competitive and to conduct the core voter activities that matter at the margins. That’s why managers work so hard to prepare a detailed budget, set up a strong fundraising operation, and spend the campaign’s funds on core activities judiciously. Ultimately responsible for a campaign’s fundraising strength, managers are also, typically, signing the campaign’s checks and making crucial decisions on spending the campaign’s finite resources.

But how, specifically, does the money matter? In which particular ways can money affect the electoral margins? As some of the qualitative evidence in this chapter illustrates, money is important to campaign managers on several levels. They know they need enough money in the bank to fund the core activities that will make them not just competitive but potentially give them a decisive edge. Money can make a candidate viable (who might otherwise not be), and campaigns that use it effectively may not even need to have the most money in the bank.

Deciding how to spend the money is arguably more important than the sheer number of dollars raised. Virtually every campaign manager told us of instances in which raising money—and spending it wisely or poorly—affected the election result. Money can give relatively unknown candidates a lift in recognition and respect; help a campaign break through with its message in a crowded primary field; refute negative attacks on the candidate; and maximize the campaign’s ability to find its core voters, reach its voters, and get them to the polls. In a competitive primary, money can enable a candidate trailing in the polls to gain earned and paid media and reach voters with his message in ways that ultimately give him a decisive advantage.

# Paying for the Messaging

Put differently, the amount of money in a campaign’s coffers drives and constrains the ability of the campaign manager to deliver the candidate’s message to the electorate. Consider how Joe Abbey, campaign manager during Creigh Deeds’s 2009 run for the Democratic nomination for Virginia governor, used a surprise infusion of funds to reach voters and influence the electorate. Abbey assumed that Deeds, a relatively unknown state senator, would never raise enough to be able to afford television ads in costly media markets such as Richmond, Norfolk, and Washington, D.C. “I originally had no money for broadcast TV in the budget. We couldn’t afford the big three,” Abbey explained. But Deeds performed well overall, and the campaign received an infusion of cash, presenting Abbey with a set of decisions he had never anticipated at the outset.15

Raising $100,000 and $200,000 at a fast clip, Abbey had to decide how to spend the windfall. He held daily calls with his consultants. Abbey realized that there was so much money that, “Oh my God, we think we could go up on D.C. TV,” and that “was going to blow everybody’s minds.” But for Abbey to buy ads in the D.C. market, he had to funnel resources from the field operation into the media buy. He fired some “great kids” who as field operatives “were doing their job.” Forty thousand dollars determined whether Abbey could sustain a televised campaign in Northern Virginia or “go up and go dark, which obviously you do not ever want to do.” So Abbey let the entire field staff go, a decision he described as “the worst experience as a manager I’ve had including losing races.”16

Abbey had seen polls showing Deeds down by 15 points. Deeds’s pollster told Abbey, “Field gets you 2 points, it doesn’t get you 15.” Abbey agreed. As Chapter 5]] will show you, television advertising, especially in some of the nation’s larger states and pricier media markets, is the best way that campaigns can reach voters with their messages. Abbey knew that the only way to win the Virginia primary was “to do it on TV. And so we just dumped it and we went up on D.C. TV, and suddenly we’re up on Richmond and suddenly we’re up on Tidewater and suddenly we’re surging [in] public polls.” Abbey made another hard choice, arguing to Deeds that the campaign had to go into debt to keep the TV ads on the air.17

“Even if we lose, you’ll still be a state senator,” Abbey reasoned with Deeds. “I think even if you’re a state senator you can probably raise a hundred grand after the primary. And I think the nominee would probably want to help because, you know, we haven’t attacked anybody and there was a general goodwill toward our candidate.” Deeds replied that he was comfortable going $80,000 but not $100,000 into debt. Abbey spent until the campaign was “80 in the hole on election day, but we won the primary.”18

On top of it, Abbey was able to hire back all the kids who were fired and who wanted to rejoin the campaign. The episode was a case “where it was really about managing your money” in ways that maximized the campaign’s odds of winning. “That was the truest, I think, example of really day-to-day budgeting on a campaign.” When the returns came in, Deeds handily defeated his two better-funded, better-known rivals. His victory stunned political observers in Virginia and Washington, D.C. Not only did Abbey help raise enough money, but he also spent it in a way that aided Deeds’s cause, maximizing the impact of the dollars they had raised. Money—spent in ways that helped Deeds reach Democratic voters in a low-turnout primary election—added up to a come-from-behind primary victory for the underdog.19

# The Nightmare of All Campaigns: Fundraising

It is worth understanding how campaigns are able to raise so many millions of dollars and why campaign managers in particular put such a premium on fundraising activities. If their goal is to win the election, they typically told us that victory is extremely difficult without raising enough money to fund the campaign’s core activities. These activities, furthermore, will vary, depending on the state, the amount of money available, the cost of television advertising in the relevant media markets, the candidate’s name identification, the campaign’s vote targets, and numerous other fast-changing factors. Because campaigns are looking for any edge they can gain to influence the margins of the election result, they have to make tough choices, but they prefer to make those choices on a campaign that has enough money to target their voters, reach them with their message, respond to the other side’s activities, and assess how they are doing as the campaign progresses.

All of this leads to the following question: How are campaign managers able to help candidates raise so much money in the first place? And why do they insist that candidates devote so much of their time to asking donors to give them money? Members of Congress, for example, typically walk or drive the few blocks between their offices and the offices of their party’s respective campaign committees. There, they engage in call time, soliciting funds from any number of wealthy donors, most of whom have a track record of donating either to the member or her party. Generally speaking, the fundraising environment is a hostile, unforgiving place for campaigns and campaign managers.

Legal, political, and personal obstacles to fundraising are ubiquitous. Major donors are receiving calls from virtually every candidate, every super political action committee (PAC) (more on super PACs in Chapter 11]]) and every party committee to which they might consider donating, and everybody is pitching their cause aggressively and consistently. Campaign managers have the challenge of showing potential donors that their campaigns are a wise investment for them. Donors, managers say, most often contribute to incumbents with a track record they admire, candidates who share their ideologies, and those who are likely to advance their economic interests once in office.

Donors typically prefer to spend on a candidate with a serious shot rather than a candidate who is almost surely going to lose. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that money always flows to the ultimate winner. Donors, according to campaign managers, have varied motivations for giving. Another challenge facing campaign managers is that they must learn the campaign finance rules to ensure they don’t run afoul of the law. It’s easier said than done. At the federal level, as of the 2016 election cycle, campaigns are prohibited by law from taking corporate contributions, and individuals are restricted to $2,700 in donations to a single candidate for each election (primary and general elections each count as individual elections).20 The Federal Election Commission (FEC) governs campaign fundraising in congressional and presidential (federal) races, whereas campaigns for governor, state legislatures, and local offices such as mayor need to follow the campaign finance laws of the state. (The secretary of state typically enforces the state laws.) But state laws vary widely, and although some states present stricter restrictions than federal elections, some states permit unlimited individual donations for candidates.21

Campaign managers who were new to a state and unfamiliar with the state’s laws had to take crash courses in finance regulations. “It’s really, really difficult to go state to state and get a good grasp on what the election laws—they’re different in each state and they change regularly,” one manager, who wished to remain anonymous to speak candidly about her experiences, reported. “And making it even harder, in some states the laws differ county to county. It’s really important, I think, before you start writing your campaign plan, to have a really good understanding of what the laws are.”22

Once, this manager was running an absentee ballot program in Iowa, having just arrived from Ohio. Knocking on doors for three days, the operative encountered a woman who said, “Oh, do you mind taking my ballot and dropping it off?”23

“Absolutely, sure,” she replied. The manager returned to the car. Her colleagues told her that it was illegal in Iowa to submit a ballot on behalf of somebody else. “You can’t take those,” they warned her. The manager went back to the voter, apologized, and gave her back her ballot.

“Especially in the world where you’re bouncing state to state, I don’t know how you can’t get super familiar with [the laws] first,” the manager reflected. “It just impacts everything you do and how you design your program,” as she had to learn the hard way.24

Campaign managers have several tools they use to help raise the funds necessary to make smart investments to fund core activities and gain marginal advantages. Although direct mail used to be the method of choice for soliciting small donations, campaigns now heavily rely on e-mail and online contributions through a campaign’s website.

Above all, though, campaign managers stress that candidates must be willing to spend hours of their day calling donors, asking supporters for money in face-to-face meetings, and asking for contributions at fundraising events. Call time is especially crucial for most candidates. James “Jimmy” Cauley, Obama’s 2004 campaign manager, summed up his approach to Obama’s finance plan pithily: “Put him on a phone and let him beg.” Barack Obama was up against a self-funded front-runner in a large state with costly media markets. Cauley’s plan for the campaign required enough funds to reach the campaign’s targeted voters (especially African Americans and white liberal women in and around Chicago’s suburbs) with the campaign’s message.25

# Cauley and Barack Obama’s Senate Win

At first blush, Cauley seemed an unlikely person to manage a Chicago candidate for the US Senate. Raised in Pikeville, Kentucky, in the Appalachian Mountains, Cauley was the son of Democrats; his father, James, was Pike County’s property valuation administrator, and his mother, Deloris, was a Democratic campaign worker.26 During college at the University of Louisville in 1990, Cauley began working on a US Senate campaign for Kentucky Democrat Harvey Sloane.27 Upon graduating in 1992, he gravitated toward the world of campaigns, and as he rose through the ranks, he won a series of races including electing the first African American mayor of Jersey City in 2001.28

Obama’s chief strategist, David Axelrod, called Cauley in 2003 when Cauley was working as chief of staff to Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD). Cauley wanted to do a top-tier Senate race that cycle, and Obama seemed like a mid-tier candidate, but Axelrod pressed him hard to manage Obama’s campaign.29

“You fly up here, you meet with the guy, and if you don’t see what I . . . see, then we’ll call it even. You get a free trip to Chicago for the day,” Axelrod offered.30 Cauley flew to Chicago, a city he had never visited, figuring he’d get a free trip but that Obama probably lacked both the money and name identification to prevail in a crowded eight-person Democratic primary.31 After talking with Obama for an hour at a tiny bakery across the street from the campaign headquarters, Cauley did an about-face. He concluded that Obama’s “got the juice.”32

When Cauley became manager in July of 2003, Obama had raised about $700,000. Obama was calling donors for funds in a tiny room with his finance director, Claire Serdiuk, who was the campaign’s first hire. The start-up campaign had a closet full of Obama’s memoirs, _Dreams from My Father_, and Cauley recalled that “if somebody wrote us a $1,000 check, we gave that shit away all the fucking time.” Obama would sign the book; send it to the donor; and that, said Cauley, “was the biggest finance plan we had. It was just call-time.”33

Cauley had a simple rule about candidate fundraising. If his candidate was not spending at least four hours a day on the phone asking for donations, the candidate was not doing his or her job. Cauley wanted Obama to connect with eight to ten people an hour over four hours of call time each day. And, “if you’re not doing twenty hours of call time a week, I’ve got no use for you. You’re not going to get elected.” Obama kept focused on the task. Cauley pointed out that another of his clients, Kentuckian Steve Beshear, actually relished the fundraising task. “He was ambitious,” Cauley recalled. “He’d call anybody and everybody and ask them for a grand. He didn’t give a shit. If he’d met you on the street, he’d ask you for a grand, no shame.” Finance was so central to Obama’s campaign operation that by primary day, around eight of Cauley’s sixteen staff were working in finance. The hotter Obama became, the more delicate the fundraising operation became.34

Robert Gibbs, who later became Obama’s first White House press secretary, joined the campaign and urged Cauley to vet the backgrounds of donors who were now giving to Obama’s campaign in droves. “Robert made me invest all this money in vetting,” said Cauley, “we hadn’t vetted a damn check. We took it, if it came through, we took it.” But now the stakes were higher, and the operations had grown substantially, and as Cauley and his team vetted hosts of fundraisers, he realized, “‘Oh my god, this guy’s been indicted. You got to take him off as a host. . . .’ All of a sudden, I was doing a lot of vetting that I didn’t do in the primary. But Robert was right” because as Obama “became bigger and bigger, people were coming out of the woodwork to give.” Cauley hired four staffers to handle the vetting, heading off any potential fundraising scandals.

Cauley ultimately helped Obama raise $6 million for the primary. Although he was vastly outspent by Hull, Obama was able to start advertising on Illinois television three weeks before the election, and he stayed up. As Hull’s campaign imploded, Obama easily won the election. But if he had raised, say, only $1 million, would he still have prevailed? Would he have then been asked to keynote the Democratic National Convention a few months later, the speech that made him a national star?35

# The Best Candidates Are Good Fundraisers

Campaign managers believe that candidates insufficiently committed to fundraising are not even worth working for. If they want to win the election, candidates—like Obama in his US Senate race—simply have to spend the time raising the money that will enable them to affect share and performance. Brandon Waters, Rick Clayburgh’s manager in his 2002 North Dakota Republican congressional campaign, called fundraising not just the biggest priority but also “the nightmare of all campaigns.”36 “Getting candidates to fundraise is always extremely difficult to do,” he explained, and putting “the potential donor lists in place and getting a structure to the fundraising process” adds to the size of the challenge.37 Democratic manager Martha McKenna, who runs a campaign firm with Jen Pihlaja, explained that when one campaign she was running failed to hit its fundraising targets, she made every staffer spend at least one hour a day calling donors. Her program helped turn the operation around, and McKenna described her fundraising philosophy as “everyone’s in it together.”38

Still, running for office and soliciting contributions was just a “dreadful” process, she admitted. Candidates would rather talk to voters, shake their hands, and hold meetings than “be in a room, dialing for dollars,” which is “a hard and lonely thing to do.” She added that managers who were personally invested in the fundraising operation were typically going to have successful fundraising campaigns.39 Indeed, managers need to expand the network of campaign donors; maintain good relations with a campaign’s financial supporters (donor maintenance); and ensure that the entire campaign is doing the right things to raise enough money to conduct its core activities, with all eyes firmly fixed on affecting the margins. Campaign managers argued that they worked hard to broaden a campaign’s donor network, launch a bundling program (in which individuals raise funds through their own networks), and sustain small-donor programs that not only generate dollars but also build grassroots enthusiasm.40 (In 2012, Obama’s presidential campaign raised more than $200 million from small-dollar contributions.)41

Persuading would-be donors to part with their money is more art than science. Some pitches work better than others, depending on the type of campaign that’s being run, the political environment, the candidate, and the would-be donor. Campaign managers often have to steer and coach candidates in order to help them become more effective fundraisers. One campaign manager we talked to argued that a good pitch should blend attacks on one’s opponent with a positive message from the candidate.42 Fear is “a very good motivator,” he said.43 Others stressed that more positive pitches could also be effective, and still other managers observed that candidates needed to call donors directly because the candidate is the person best positioned to ask for donations, and they have to start with their family and friends and then go beyond their comfort zone. Even during so-called “wave” elections (when one party benefits from a national trend in its direction), candidates, managers told us, need enough money if they are going to catch the wave.

Fundraising often involves a dance between the manager and the candidate, in which the candidate wants to meet voters and community leaders and the campaign manager is pushing the candidate to spend more time raising money. Brad Beychok, who served as Democrat Charlie Melancon’s 2010 campaign manager for a Louisiana congressional seat, agreed with his colleagues that candidates disliked sitting in a room calling friends and strangers and asking for money for hours at a time. It was vital, he explained, to balance that distasteful part of the process by incentivizing candidates, so with some candidates, he made them a deal, offering, “Look, will you call until five o’clock? At five o’clock, you can go do whatever you want. You can go to Walmart and shake hands.”44

Campaign managers take their fundraising roles—the budget and money aspect of being the entrepreneur—seriously because, again, the activities that the money funds matter. “It is your job, as manager, to make sure that there is a comprehensive fundraising plan in place and that it is being effectively executed,” Stuart Roy, Republican Ben Nighthorse Campbell’s campaign manager on a 1998 Colorado Senate race, told us.45 Campaign managers, Jen Pihlaja argued, had to hold everybody accountable for fundraising goals and ensure that if the plan gets off track that the campaign “adjust and correct.”46 Campaign manager Todd Schulte, who ran Democrat Scott Murphy’s 2010 New York congressional race, insisted that candidates should be warned that skipping an activity as vital as “call time” meant the loss of “days of TV” ads.47 Parades, reaching a relatively small number of voters, were worthless, but fundraising, campaign manager Casey Phillips declared, can help candidates ultimately win votes by supporting activities that reach voters on a large enough scale to affect the election at the margins.48

Losing campaigns can often have enough money and sufficient organization, but it is hard to win a race when the campaign lacks the resources it needs to mobilize and persuade targeted voters. If the organization isn’t set up and resourced appropriately, it is harder for it to find the people it needs to achieve victory. Thus, campaign managers prize money and organization. Money matters because the campaign’s activities can affect share and performance on the margins. Structure and finance are not the sole factors determining election outcomes, of course. But without the right structure and enough money to conduct core campaign activities, campaigns are unlikely to be successful. Almost all campaigns need entrepreneurs at the top able to raise the funds, hire the right people, organize the team effectively, and execute plans—ultimately launching the campaign on a winning course.

# 5 Team Builder Embracing the Personal Side of Politics

**I**n 2015, Hillary Clinton selected then-thirty-seven-year-old Robby Mook to be her campaign manager in her quest for the presidency, and it seemed like a smart choice. She considered Mook somebody who could help her replicate Barack Obama’s highly disciplined presidential campaigns. As she explained in _What Happened_, her book about the 2016 campaign, she had admired Obama’s “‘no drama’ campaign organization that largely avoided damaging infighting and leaks.” So, she wrote,

> John Podesta and I talked with President Obama and [campaign manager] David Plouffe about how to construct a team that could replicate these successes. Plouffe was a big fan of Robby Mook, whom I ultimately chose as campaign manager. Robby had impressed David by helping me win against the odds—and against him—in Nevada, Ohio, and Indiana in 2008. In all three states, he put together aggressive field programs and competed hard for every vote. Then he went on to manage my friend Terry McAuliffe’s successful long shot campaign for Governor of Virginia. Robby was on a roll—young, but like Plouffe, highly disciplined and levelheaded, with a passion for data and a talent for organizing.1

# “A Fierce Team Spirit”

Mook had shown himself a deft team builder on his previous campaigns prior to Clinton’s. In an interview with us in 2013, he stressed how every campaign had a culture and that the culture varied from one campaign to the next. He pointed out how “it is the responsibility of a manger to establish a culture within the campaign. It’s important to be deliberate about that culture.”2 He went on to say the following:

> Some campaign managers try to be thrifty. Some campaign managers try to maximize the amount of work people are doing. I think setting the right kind of _culture_ in the organization is [vital], and so what I personally look for are people who are going to be loyal to the candidate and to the organization, people who are going to be self-motivated to work really hard. I’m not looking for people who are interested in being on the campaign for the purpose of going on to do something else. I want to know that they’re going to work hard right now for this campaign.3

Mook said that the most important thing in terms of getting culture right for the campaign is for people to have the mind-set that the team is “there to win” and “[be] successful in the campaign” above all other considerations.4 In Mook’s mind, strategy plus team offered the best chance for success.

In 2016, Mook built what one senior aide called “a fierce team spirit” in Clinton’s Brooklyn-based headquarters. Mook’s aides loved him, and he loved them. Mook instilled his team with a passion for ensuring that Clinton won the White House. Together, they saw her presidential bid as the best chance to ensure a better future, and deemed Republican nominee Donald Trump a real threat to the nation’s democratic norms and institutions. With the stakes impossibly high, Mook was able to get his team to row with unity toward these shared goals. He took some unheralded steps that paid big dividends in building his team spirit. When Mook traveled, he always stayed at the houses of local campaign supporters and workers, and never in a hotel. He was very frugal with campaign money, making staff take the bus between New York City and Washington, D.C., inspiring a sense of sacrifice even among the team’s most senior members.5 Mook imbued in colleagues a faith in data, giving them confidence that their models predicting which voters would actually vote would give them a path to victory. Clinton’s senior advertising strategist Jim Margolis told us in an interview that Mook’s team-building talents were uncanny. “Mook,” Margolis explained,

> engenders a tremendous amount of loyalty, and he, like I think some of the best managers ever, as a character trait, it’s not just loyalty to them, it’s part of a bigger sense of purpose that he gives people. And he created a very strong bond among staff. There was a fierce team spirit that people had. He would lead people in a chant at the end of every staff meeting and at the end of nights. He made people want to work seven days a week and sixteen hours a day. There were moments that people wanted to kill him. He’s cheap as hell. He really did have a lot of people riding on buses back and forth to . . . Washington.
> 
> But at the same time, you sort of believed that he was in it, too. Robby never stayed in hotels. . . . He always stayed with supporters. . . . In these primary states, you would be sitting in her suite at one o’clock in the morning, maybe having a beer, if you won. And you’d try to avoid the suite if you lost. But at one o’clock in the morning, Robby’s getting in a car and driving to somebody’s house, instead of going downstairs to his room. . . . The 150 bucks wasn’t gonna make a difference in a one billion dollar campaign. But there was a symbolic importance to those acts, which said, “We’re gonna keep our eye on what’s important. We’re gonna invest in the stuff that actually moves votes. And everybody’s gonna take some responsibility for trying to do it the right way.”6

Nothing captured the Mookian team spirit better than what transpired in the middle of the night after Clinton had won a series of crucial primaries, on March 15, 2016. Clinton and Mook were in Florida, and they flew back to New York; Mook arrived at Brooklyn headquarters around 2:00 a.m. The team was exhausted and elated. Clinton’s primary opponent, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, was a septuagenarian Democratic-Socialist who had defeated Clinton in New Hampshire, Michigan, and other key states, and he had improbably threatened her march to the Democratic nomination. But on March 15, Clinton won states including Florida, Missouri, and Ohio, all but wrapping up her bid for the Democratic nomination. At headquarters, Mook ran down a hall past aides who had formed what one described as “a human tunnel.” In the room with scores of weary aides gathered around him, Mook held an impromptu pep rally. “Hillary Clinton had to sweep things up!” he declared. “Hillary Clinton is going to be our next President. No matter how hard we have to work, how high we have to climb, we are going to get there because she is the unifying leader our country needs!”7

Mook and his team deserved much credit. They turned back a serious primary challenge from Sanders, and Clinton became the first woman to win a major-party presidential nomination. In the end, however, Mook’s team spirit could only carry Clinton so far. In fact, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump in the general election, and one factor that led to this surprise outcome was that Clinton, Mook, and their team were all on the wrong page. The team was operating in unison, yet it wasn’t pulling in the direction that would lead them to victory.

There were numerous problems, in retrospect. Mook’s team adopted the insular, defensive qualities that had become a hallmark of Clinton’s historic candidacy. For example, rather than quickly telling the public that Clinton had walking pneumonia after she had collapsed on September 11, 2016, the team took some six hours before they announced the news.8 That fed the impression that the campaign wasn’t forthcoming with voters. Mook’s team became in hindsight too dependent on data models that were flawed and removed from the reality of what was happening on the ground in key battleground states. They ended up losing in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, all states they believed were theirs. One prominent critic, interim Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile, charged that “the young men that surrounded Robby Mook . . . had mastered a cool and removed style of politics. They knew how to size up voters not by meeting them, and finding out what they cared about, what moved their hearts and stirred their souls, but by analyzing their habits.”9

Mook’s team was also a victim of group thinking; they assumed they were going to win partly because they didn’t see how Americans could possibly vote for a race-baiting, misogynistic, troglodyte candidate named Donald Trump. Margolis said that he was careful never to take an election outcome for granted, except for Clinton 2016. Mook’s team didn’t understand how they might lose to Trump, and the team’s insular quality kept it overly confident in victory. They rejected advice from former president Bill Clinton that the campaign should more aggressively counter Trump’s appeal to working-class white voters in midwestern states.10 Instead of a laser-like focus on Michigan and Wisconsin, Mook’s team put resources into Arizona in the fall, a state that Democrats hadn’t won in twenty years. Clinton lost to Trump because she lost three states—Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania—by a grand total of roughly 80,000 votes. The margin separating victor from loser in each state was less than 1 percent of the vote. Numerous factors contributed to Clinton’s loss, of course. Yet team building, building a culture that turned out to be wrong for the kind of campaign being waged, helped shape the outcome. The team culture shaped decisions on how to target voters, who to target, and what they should tell them, and the result was one of the more shocking presidential elections in modern times.11

# Team Building in Trump’s Campaign

In contrast to the harmony built by Mook in Brooklyn, Trump filled his team with a consistent sense of drama and chaos, dysfunction on steroids. It was the kind of chaos restricted to the most disastrous political campaigns, the ones that end up losing by double digits. Yet Trump prevailed. How did he pull it off? Trump had three campaign managers, none of whom were effective team builders. Corey Lewandowski infuriated some of Trump’s senior aides and family members with his bombastic, take-no-prisoners approach, and as campaign manager he even became the subject of a criminal police investigation for having grabbed the arm of a female reporter during a campaign event to stop her from asking the candidate a question.12 (No charges were filed.) Paul Manafort replaced Lewandowski; although Manafort was a veteran Republican operative who helped run Trump’s relatively successful nominating convention, he had also taken millions of dollars from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. When the _New York Times_ published a story raising questions about the legality of Manafort’s Ukrainian work, Trump fired him.13 (In 2017, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted Manafort and Trump’s deputy campaign manager Rick Gates on a variety of charges, and as of this writing they are awaiting trial.)14 Manafort’s replacements, Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon, were hardly team builders in any conventional campaign sense of the term. They reinforced Trump’s desire to campaign as the antiestablishment flamethrower. Yet as CEO of Breitbart News, Bannon was a lightning rod, with critics charging that his media site promoted racist, anti-Semitic, conspiracy theory stories. A self-described street fighter, Bannon had little interest in building an esprit du corps among Trump’s campaign organization.

Yet for all the chaos at the top, Trump’s team had some hidden assets. Behind the scenes, the Republican National Committee was able to professionalize the operation in ways that delivered financial and organizational benefits to Trump’s fall campaign. As Chapter 1]] described, the RNC’s director of digital strategy Gary Coby stepped into the chaos, formed a strong bond with Trump aide Brad Parscale, and without much fanfare built a 100-person digital team operating out of a floor of a nondescript office building near the San Antonio airport.15 Coby explained the delicate footwork that the effort required. “We’re the RNC guys coming in,” he told us. “We are the guys they kind of ran against and we’re like, ‘Hey, let’s be friends.’” He said of building his relationship with Parscale:

> I started peppering him with a lot of questions. I think he had a couple light bulb moments thinking, _This guy could be good for me_. . . . My strengths were probably his weaknesses, so we had a good ying-yang going there and vice versa. We kind of bonded that second day. Then I went back home, did another trip down very quick. Then June 16, I went down. I was supposed to go down there for five days. It was like a Thursday, Friday. The following Monday, [Corey] Lewandowski [campaign manager] left the campaign and then doors just started opening.
> 
> I got the green light, or Brad got the green light, to start buying ads on Facebook and Twitter and all the platforms to start fundraising, to start doing e-mail fundraising. On June 21, the first day he started buying ads. . . . Those first two days, we raised five or six million dollars just like that online.16

Within a matter of a few months, Coby and Parscale built a hardworking, freewheeling culture of experimentalism in Trump’s digital operation. The team helped the campaign to raise tens of millions of dollars and fueled the grassroots passion that helped Trump win a narrow victory in the Electoral College. Coby seized on the chaos in Trump Tower and used it to his advantage. He decided that he would forgo seeking routine approvals from Trump’s brain trust, telling aides he would sign off on ad content that used previous approved messaging. He stressed that his team should feel free to experiment with their ads, a message that “freed [people] up and everyone started thinking differently. . . . Everyone started being very open with their ideas and we really had a mentality of ‘let’s test everything.’”

Coby also did some quiet team building with Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Coby having raised so much money for Trump, Kushner started paying attention to his operation, and Coby told Kushner he needed videos from the principals to raise even more for the campaign. Kushner told Coby one day that Trump and daughter Ivanka were “shooting some TV commercials in two days” and that Coby should write some scripts for them and “we’ll get your stuff in there.”

Coby had a simple reply: “Awesome.”17

Coby’s little-known team-building role revealed a larger force at work in Trump’s operation that helped make his victory possible. His campaign was not as dysfunctional as it appeared. Trump’s under-the-radar digital operation in San Antonio, led by a lightning fast, nimble, and experimental team, gave Trump resources to reach voters and fire the passion of Trump’s hardcore partisan supporters. In an election that was so close, this mattered. Coby helped Trump maximize the personnel, knowledge, and experience of the professionals at the RNC, giving Trump the wherewithal to vie for victory with the Mook-led juggernaut across the river in Brooklyn.

*****

Campaigns seeking to gain a competitive, marginal advantage over their rivals need to be able to build the team and campaign structure, enabling the operation to work effectively toward securing victory on election day. Team building may sound incidental to victory, and at times it may not much matter. The fundamentals are so strong on some campaigns that no matter how strong a team culture, or how rancorous the mood, the teams themselves don’t affect the election outcome. Yet in contests where the margins matter, the right kind of team culture can help answer the questions campaigns need to ask themselves, especially how do we reach them? And how are we doing? Well-run teams driving toward the same goal can help candidates target, reach, mobilize, and persuade voters. Thus, some of a campaign’s most mundane-sounding elements—renting a physical space, hiring staff, defining people’s roles and responsibilities, building trust in every level of the organization—can affect how well or poorly a campaign functions and shape election results.

Even seasoned candidates who know their districts or states rely on campaign teams to help them formulate a message, identify voter targets, and figure out how to reach them. Particularly in a time when social and digital media are becoming more central to campaigning, having a savvy, harmonious staff can help move the campaign’s electoral margins, which often separates victors from losers. Well-built teams help candidates assess how campaigns are performing, determine when and how to adjust tactics and strategies, track what allies and opponents are saying, and plot a path to victory.

# Hiring the Right Team

Campaign managers told us that building the ship requires hiring the right people, who raise money and make spending decisions that affect share and performance on the margins. That’s why we came across remarks like this one from Republican campaign manager Jon Reedy: “The two most valuable assets that you have on a campaign are your money and your people.”18 The key for many managers was less that they find the most experienced people with the best reputations; rather, they said they were looking for people who understood the candidate and the campaign’s culture—aides who would complement a manager’s strengths and understood the candidate and the campaign’s values and goals, thus making them more effective in carrying out the activities that would influence the final vote tally.

The 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, told us that on his campaigns the manager was indeed responsible for hiring the right staff.

> If you’re lucky, the campaign manager has been in the political arena long enough to know some of the players that will make up the campaign. Some he will want to bring onto the team, others he will approach for references. After my campaign manager had identified key players, he said, “I think you ought to hire this person. I’ve worked with them before. If you like them when you meet them, I want you to sell them on joining.” Finding and recruiting the team is a big part of the campaign manager’s responsibility.19

Republican campaign manager Kyle Robertson, who ran the 2008 congressional campaign in Missouri’s ninth district and the successful campaigns for governor in Indiana (Mike Pence 2012) and Michigan (Rick Snyder 2014), stressed his desire to find utility players “committed to a team concept,” arguing that every staffer had to do every job, from fundraiser to field operator.20 Matt McDonald, who ran Eli Pirozzi’s 1999 congressional campaign in California’s 43rd district, said the bulk of his staffers should “be worker bees” who were eager to do whatever it took to win.21 They had to have “a lot of energy and enthusiasm” because the jobs required staffers to work twelve to fifteen hours a day, seven days a week, for three or four months, and at paltry pay.22 In Herman Cain’s offbeat 2012 White House run, manager Mark Block relayed that his “number one challenge was to find people to hire that understood what we were trying to do and that is to run a national campaign, a nontraditional campaign,” that prioritized local control and “was going to be from the bottom up.”23 Stephanie Cutter, who held senior roles in Obama’s 2012 and Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaigns, remarked on how the speed of campaigns meant “everybody at every level of a campaign needs good judgment. . . . There’s a lot of autonomy for mid- to lower-level people and making some pretty big decisions.” In addition, “you spend 24/7 together so you also need good-natured, team-oriented people who understand that they’re working for something greater than themselves.” Joe Abbey, who ran Creigh Deeds’s 2009 campaign for governor in Virginia, reflected that “when it’s a tough campaign or you’re close or you’re losing, you don’t want people to pull the knives on one another because, as a manager, I don’t want to be dealing with that distraction when we obviously need to be focused on the campaign.”24

# Political Talent Scouts

Raised in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula as a diehard Green Bay Packers fan, Jen Pihlaja learned that finding the right people for her campaigns was an art that the best managers were able to master. Right after college, she ran a program for undergraduates who wanted a semester-long experience in politics during the 1996 election cycle.25 She worked as a field director and a campaign manager on congressional races, spent three years on Capitol Hill as a legislative assistant, conducted opposition research for EMILY’S List, and spent five years total at the organization advising its leaders on recruiting candidates and then helping the candidates run their campaigns. She eventually became the political director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC).

She argued the following:

> A first-time manager will often have been a communications director or field director or research director or some other, finance director. And so they have strengths. I think one of the things that is really important that they do is not hire people who mirror their strengths, but mirror their weaknesses, and empower them to do their jobs. You know, I think that’s an incredibly important piece of what a manager can do is recognize what they are good at and what they’re not.26

She argued that hiring staff too quickly could undermine the campaign’s planning, and she has seen campaigns have to fire volunteer coordinators who, it turned out, “really [didn’t] like volunteers” and weren’t actually “people people.” Another time, a research consultant failed to produce the research, so Pihlaja stopped payment for the work and found a replacement. But Pihlaja blamed herself for hiring the wrong people as much as the individuals who performed poorly. Paying attention to the candidate’s strengths and finding people to complement those strengths were all high on her list of priorities. But she also admires resumes from people who had worked as waiters or waitresses. She wants people “who don’t give up, who are flexible, resourceful, fun, trustworthy, but they don’t necessarily have to have political experience.” She also prefers a team member who is “smart and exercises good judgment and who is having fun and who wants to be a part of it than somebody who has a particular pedigree.”27

Screven Watson, who managed Rod Smith’s 2006 bid for Florida governor, approached hiring through a somewhat different set of priorities. “The biggest pain in my ass in any campaign has been scheduling,” he told us. Bad scheduling “can eat you alive.” One candidate called Watson at 11:30 p.m. one night in tears “because she had just driven two hours from one event to the other in a rural county.”28 “I’ve got a family. I can’t do this,” she told him. The scheduler had screwed up, and Watson now had a mini-crisis. But in building his team, something else weighed even more heavily on Watson: He had to find the right lawyer who would keep the campaign within the letter and spirit of campaign law and prevent a PR debacle, which, in the worst cases, can fatally wound a campaign. “You cannot screw up the legal part of it,” he said.29

Then there are the situations in which a committee is running the campaign. Sally Bradshaw, who came on to manage Jeb Bush’s losing 1994 gubernatorial campaign, recalled the situation facing her when she took the reins of Bush’s campaign.

> It was a campaign by committee that was a disaster. That was the mess in ’94, campaign by committee. Too many egos at the table. So Jeb came to me and said, “I want you to manage—I want you to hire the consultants. I have some thoughts on who I think would be good. I think there’s some people we need to go back to and talk to, but this is your job. You’re going to run the campaign and you have to get the team set up.”30

Although Bush lost his 1994 bid, Bradshaw re-upped with Bush and ran his winning gubernatorial race in 1998. Her approach was to hire exceptional team players and not individuals who only looked good on paper—“a communications director who was not trying to be the media guy. . . . A scheduler who was really focused on scheduling of events and building crowds. . . . Nobody who goes, ‘I don’t have a lot of time for that.’” Having learned some of the staffing and management lessons from four years before, Bush, with Bradshaw’s guidance, triumphed.31

Unlike some workplaces, campaigns have both full-time staff and part-time consultants, and managing consultants can pose a distinct challenge to keeping the team unified in support of the campaign’s strategy. Consultants often are carrying multiple clients, yet they can have enormous sway over the campaign’s strategic decisions. Managing both full- and part-time staff forces managers to serve in the role of boss, mentor, colleague, taskmaster, and cheerleader all at the same time in some cases, and integrating the consultants into the team is an exercise in diplomacy, finesse, and other interpersonal skills. Democratic manager Raiyan Syed’s approach to team building was to integrate his consultants into the mission by getting them invested in the strategy long before election day. He has held weekly sixty- or ninety-minute calls with the candidate and the consultants to review the strategy and discuss how the other side was doing: “Politically, media, here’s what’s happening, here’s what’s going on. Candidate, do you have any questions? What are you thinking? What are your thoughts?”32

His staff sent the consultants news clips and talked to individual consultants, sometimes daily, discussing such topics as which issues they should jump on, which ones to watch, and sought their input on a press release or policy rollout. Syed also weaved his consultants into the campaign’s culture by using the media consultant as the candidate’s media trainer. He described bringing the media person to a retreat to “have them spend time with the candidate, have them coach the candidate on messaging, on just the whole presentation. You’re going to have a big TV interview, this is how you pivot, this is your body language. We do mock . . . interviews, show it to them.” And, he added, “debate prep is huge,” offering another team-building opportunity. “You need your research firm, you need your pollster, you need your media consultant, you need mock debates, [including] a set of questions,” and the consultants ideally became deeply invested in the process, the candidate, and the strategy. His best method to build a true team of professionals is to hire consultants whose track records as team players are spotless.33

Building team spirit and managing strong personalities also meant, campaign managers said, establishing clear lines of authority within the campaign. “The worst campaigns are full of gray area on who’s supposed in be in charge of what,” Republican manager Scott Reed argued.34 Republican manager Mike Shields explained his preferred method of “delegate[ing] [to his staff] with clarity.”35 Former Richard Nixon and Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone went even further. He argued that the best-run campaigns with the strongest teams tend to be the dictatorships, and he quoted Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s axiom that “war councils breed defeat.”36 Stone saw firsthand that when Nixon micromanaged the strategic decisions during his 1960 presidential bid, the campaign turned into “an abysmal disaster.”37 Stone recalled that Nixon refused to “take any advice,” antagonizing his staff.38 By entrusting key decisions in the hands of a single staff person (ideally, the campaign manager), campaigns, Stone reasoned, would exude a can-do attitude, a sense of forward motion, and instill confidence in the mission.

On Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 2006 California gubernatorial campaign, deputy manager Reed Galen concluded that one reason the team functioned so well was that everybody knew and remained in their lanes. Schwarzenegger’s manager Steve Schmidt’s role was to look “up and out,” while Galen was charged with managing the campaign’s finances and day-to-day operations. Schmidt told staff that had finance-related questions, “This is what I pay Reed for.” Galen felt that the division of labor between them helped build an effective team, where each person felt empowered to do his or her job and knew exactly where they fit into the campaign structure.39

# Team Builder: “A Big Cheerleader”

It’s hard to be an effective campaign manager, or run an effective campaign, without also building a harmonious team that embraces the strategy and works hard to achieve the campaign’s strategic goals. It is hardly ever enough simply for managers to hire good staff and let them tackle their jobs. Team building requires campaign managers to adopt various personas during the course of the race, depending on the manager’s style, the candidate, and the type of culture they’re building. Graham Shafer told us that team building required him to function as “a big cheerleader” for his staff because he’s “seen so many campaigns that just have an awful vibe because a campaign manager has an awful attitude.”40 When running Van Hilleary’s Tennessee governor’s campaign, Shafer tried to use positive reinforcement to motivate his team and make them feel invested in the mission.

“The campaign manager drives the entire strategy process, convening the strategy team, drawing out the candidate’s perspective, and making sure that a compelling strategy is in place. Then the manager becomes the implementer in chief of that strategy. In my presidential campaign, that’s the way it worked,” Mitt Romney told us. “The campaign manager . . . is also responsible for the morale and spirit of the campaign. No one else can do that with the exception of the candidate, but typically the candidate is away from the office campaigning,” he added. “At critical times, particularly following one of the inevitable losses or disappointments, the campaign manager is the one to rally the troops, to restore enthusiasm and to remind them of the importance of the task ahead.”41

Democratic campaign veteran Joe Abbey recalled the impact that the manager had on morale when he was a young twenty-something on Mark Warner’s Virginia gubernatorial campaign:

> I’ll never forget Steve Jarding, who ran Warner’s gubernatorial campaign, was walking through when we were making yard signs for a big weekend push. We were putting widgets into the bags. I mean, he stopped. Table of ten staffers for about, I like to think it was thirty minutes, it was probably three. Put yard signs together, talked to us, told us how important this was, explained to us how this weekend and getting this out there was important to the strategy of the campaign. And then went. I will never forget that. Because you’re twenty-one, twenty-two, you’re making nothing a month and the guy who’s running this campaign who has no reason to really talk to you. You just did what you did and they explained how important it was to the operation. So suddenly, your crap pay, your long hours, don’t feel like that.42

On many losing campaigns, the team building frays, the staff bickers ad nauseam, and the campaign is listing off course as a result. Internal rifts, stoked by opinionated, intransigent personalities, can center on spending decisions, hiring decisions, the proper role of the candidate’s family, and debates about which team members should fill which roles, just to name a few examples. But whatever the friction’s roots, such tension can wreak havoc inside and outside a campaign. The inner tension can foster a toxic climate for a campaign team and even filter into the news media that can turn the campaign into Exhibit A of how not to run a campaign. When that happens, not only is the candidate’s image as a strong leader eroded, but also campaign donors and volunteers tend to be less willing to support a campaign that’s perceived as sputtering. Answering the “How are we doing?” question becomes an extended, debilitating exercise in crisis management and damage control.

Although this level of acrimony and negative press can occasionally be overcome by campaigns, fractured teams are a distraction to the candidate, the managers, and every other team member, diverting their focus from the campaign’s strategic priorities. Instead of defining their opponents and delivering their message about the candidate’s good character and leadership skills, friction-filled campaigns must devote energy and resources to fixing the impression of dysfunction and disarray that has engulfed it. Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign became known for chief strategist Mark Penn’s imperious approach as well as staff discord, strategy disputes, and an inner circle shielding Clinton from outside advice and projecting a haughty air of electoral invincibility. These negative impressions became part of the narrative about her presidential run, while the esprit de corps of Obama’s team offered pundits a ready-made contrast to the dysfunction of Hillary Clinton’s operation. Her team’s dynamics, at least on the margins, damaged her chances in the Democratic primary.

Other examples of dysfunctional teams retarding campaign progress abound. Early in the 2004 presidential campaign, John Kerry had both a Boston- and Washington-based campaign staff that vied for control over the campaign’s direction. The war within became part of the news cycle, and during the primary campaign, Kerry was ultimately forced to fire a number of senior staffers to try to fix his flailing campaign. In this case, Kerry was able to overcome the negative publicity and staff infighting, the lack of team harmony and strategic accord, yet the feel of acrimony never entirely left Kerry’s side, and it wasn’t clear that his staff felt particular loyalty to the candidate or that the team was absolutely committed to his election. Kerry is hardly alone. Early in the 2008 Republican primary race, John McCain was forced to revamp his own team because the discord among his staff had grown so corrosive. Although he eventually became his party’s nominee, a poorly managed staff process was partially responsible for the lack of vetting of Alaska governor Sarah Palin before he picked her as his running mate. Palin’s selection gave the campaign an initial bump in the polls. But the team’s inability to function smoothly left the impression that the candidate was unreliable and inconsistent.

Other instances of campaign infighting can divert the campaign’s message, sap its energy, and damage the candidate’s public image of strength and leadership. In 2015, _Politico_ ran a story headlined “Inside Rand Paul’s Downward Spiral,” chronicling staff infighting, a listless candidate, campaign indirection, and an overall dispirited organization.43 This is hardly the kind of publicity that, campaign managers told us, furthers their causes; rather, such press tends to dampen donor ardor for the candidate and create a media feeding frenzy leading to a downward spiral. Losing campaign managers sometimes get desperate, resorting to tricks to keep their staff motivated. Casey Phillips, who ran Delbert Hosemann’s 2007 Mississippi campaign for secretary of state, described how when he worked as political director on a different campaign, he found a poll that the campaign manager had commissioned and, it seemed, accidentally left on the printer. The poll showed the campaign running neck and neck; when Phillips found the poll, he went and told his entire campaign team that “the campaign manager . . . forgot to pick up this poll,” which showed, he predicted, that their campaign was heading for victory. Yet, he recalled, on election day “we just got slaughtered.” Much later, the campaign manager told Phillips “that he [left the poll on the printer] on purpose knowing that I’d find it and knowing that I would keep everybody going.”44

Ideally, of course, campaigns need not resort to such tricks to keep the team operating on the same strategic page and focused on the same goal. Brad Beychok said his duty was to assemble a team that functioned harmoniously and worked together to persuade and mobilize voters. He described some campaigns he’s worked on where the pollster, media consultant, and direct mail consultant are all “big personalit[ies],” and the collection of “big brains” and “big egos” sowed “confusion and dissension.” So Beychok strives to hire people whom he knows well and who have a reputation for being team players. Then he works hard to fashion the staff into a team that moves in unison toward the same direction.45

Even the best-run campaigns have challenges building the right teams and keeping the campaign driving toward its strategic goals. Every campaign experiences some level of internal friction because not every team member always agrees on every issue. And, with the stakes high for the candidates and their senior staff, debates often get heated. But Republican manager Mike Shields described that on his campaigns he has a rule that “once a decision is made, you have to execute it even if you disagreed with it so that you’re not dividing.”46 The team has to agree to disagree and immediately implement the plan to keep the campaign on its winning path.

Team building requires managers and their staff to put the campaign’s priorities ahead of their own egos and ideas as well. They must subordinate their self-pride and financial interests to the campaign’s strategic interests and the candidate’s agenda. “Running races and winning elections requires strategy, organization and discipline,” John Lawrence, former chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who helped Democrats win the House majority in 2006, wrote in a 2017 blog post. Criticizing Democrats drawing attention to themselves and distracting from the goal of retaking the House in 2018, Lawrence urged Democrats “to exercise greater self-regulation over the course of the next year, forgoing self-promotion in favor of promoting party effectiveness to avoid putting the Democratic Party on the same track as the Republicans’ Trump train wreck.”47 Brandon Waters, who ran Rick Clayburgh’s 2002 North Dakota campaign for Congress, described a race in Pennsylvania he worked where a consultant suggested running a particular TV spot. The campaign’s TV consultant dissented. Instead, he replied, “I think that’s a better message for mail.”48 Waters recalled thinking that he knew then that he “truly had a team of professionals” because his TV consultant was the one saying, “No, we shouldn’t do a TV ad on that. That should be delivered through mail because it can be better targeted to the correct audience.”49 The consultant was more interested in furthering the campaign’s cause than in lining his own pocket and accruing more power in his own hands.

Team building also was synonymous with campaign managers taking a share of responsibility for the well-being of their staff—and their postcampaign professional lives. David Axelrod described well-run campaigns as having an almost “familial feel” and stressed the need to help campaign staff find good jobs in politics once the campaign had ended.50 Democratic campaign manager James Cauley told us that on an unnamed campaign he came to the aid of one of his young staffers who had had his driver’s license suspended after he got a speeding ticket. Cauley sent “somebody to go pick [the staffer] up and bring him to work every day for a month” because he was his key Internet adviser. Cauley felt loyalty to all the “little . . . souls” working nonstop on behalf of the candidate.51

Raiyan Syed told us that when he assembles his campaign team, he puts a sign on the door or wall that in its own way echoes Carville’s signage. The sign says, “The Can-do Club.” Syed instills the notion that negative attitudes—“can’t work” or “won’t work”—are anathema to building the campaign’s team spirit. “If there’s a thing we want to do, we can do it.”52

Gentry Collins, who helped run Mitt Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign, told us that “if you have carefully laid out what a campaign strategy looks like and you have been meticulous about building a set of tactical operations that serve that strategy and that you’ve done your hiring to serve both, then you ought to be able to make very clear to the whole team, and by the way, not just staff, but volunteers, vendors, the whole campaign team should understand in very clear terms what has to be accomplished in order to be successful.”53 Although tight-knit campaign teams are hardly a guarantee that campaigns will be victorious, the right team, rowing in unison to reach the same goal, can help the campaign to answer the critical questions: Who are our target voters? How do we reach them? Strong campaign teams make campaigns more nimble, put forth consistent messaging, and create fewer headaches for the campaign manager and the campaign. Strong campaign teams may not always be difference makers, but candidates and their managers who ignore the art of team building do so at their peril.

# 6 Ideologist and Policy Wonk Standing for Something

David Axelrod, chief strategist on Barack Obama’s two presidential campaigns, said he always asked potential clients to tell him why they were seeking elective office. If they couldn’t give a persuasive answer, Axelrod would advise them not to run and reiterate, “I’m not in the business of telling you why you should want to run for something.” Candidates unable to articulate their ideology and stand for a clear set of ideas or policies often lack the tools necessary to energize the electorate. In contrast, candidates who give voters a real sense of why they want the jobs in question can mobilize their supporters and come across as authentic in their beliefs and positions.1 Policy positions and ideological stances inform the message, define the candidates, and provide the basis for the back-and-forth duels setting rival campaigns against each other.

# Steve Bannon as Trump’s Chief Ideologist

Take Steve Bannon, a Harvard MBA investment banker turned media titan who in 2016 served as chief ideologist on Trump’s unlikely presidential campaign. Bannon relished the notion that he was an antiestablishment brigand out to topple the aging, corrupt political order. Bannon told CBS News that in the hours after Trump’s surprise victory it became clear that he, and his antiestablishment ideology, had prevailed. Here’s how he described the moment: “I’d never been on a campaign in my entire life. I’m a former investment banker who’s a media guy, running a little website. . . . Our whole campaign was a little bit the island of misfit toys. So [Trump] looks around and I’m wearing my combat jacket, I haven’t shaved, I got, you know, my hair’s down to here.”2

In 2016, Bannon provided the ballast that grounded Trump’s campaign in a style and ideological appeal pitched to an electorate unhappy with the status quo. Trump’s “America First,” nationalist, and populist candidacy was based in part on Bannon’s work at Breitbart News. As head of that media outlet, Bannon became an outspoken voice against free trade and railed against immigration and immigrants, arguments that were centerpieces of Trump’s White House run. Bannon loathed career politicians in both parties, and his policy views and ideology helped to tar Hillary Clinton and the Bush family as the faces of the political establishment. “I hold these people in contempt, total and complete contempt,” Bannon said of President George W. Bush’s foreign policy team, to cite one example.

Joshua Green, author of a best-selling biography of Bannon, told us that one of the reasons Trump won was his ability to persuade voters that he was nothing if not authentic. Trump figured that he would steer “away from consultants, and focus groups, and carefully hedging what it is that I stand for, and what I say, and try and come across as someone more authentic.” And Green credits Bannon with providing the ideological fuel that powered Trumpism. “In a day to day sense, I think Bannon really did run that campaign” after he came on board in August of 2016, Green told us. “Even before he took over, back when he was at Breitbart . . . he was a very big influence on Trump, because he helped instill this hard right, anti-immigrant, populist brand of nationalism way back, years before Trump actually ran, when more mainstream Republican consultants had no interest in talking to Trump. Bannon was happy to do so.” Green concluded that Bannon became the ideologist behind the Trump phenomenon.

> Bannon isn’t a guy who concerns himself with the minutiae of public policy. He’s more of a big picture campaign messenger. He doesn’t have any policy background. I think he has a broad sense of what he’d like to do and accomplish in politics, but he’s not somebody who comes from Capitol Hill, and has any experience writing legislation. . . . He’s somebody who views politics from an altitude of 30,000 feet. He views elections not as opportunity to incrementally advance certain public policies, but as grand, historical dramas with global significance, the same way he talked about Trump’s election being part of this right wing global uprising.3

This pose was consistent with Bannon’s political past. Contrary to his claim that the Trump campaign was his first, Bannon did work on another campaign. In 1975, during his junior year at Virginia Tech, Bannon launched his own bid to become president of Tech’s Student Government Association. And he won that race. One of the campaign’s most striking features was the ways in which it presaged Trump’s. Bannon ran as a flame-throwing outsider vowing to shake up the campus establishment. Bannon argued that he alone would have the guts to confront the systemic abuses that harmed student life. “SGA Candidates usually deal in Platitudes, Promises and Slogans,” one Bannon campaign flier sneered. “We believe the concerns of our campus are too serious to be dealt with so evasively.” Bannon also had some policy proposals, vowing to improve availability of student housing, make the library accessible, and enhance the overall undergraduate experience. Bannon went so far as to attack the Washington establishment while running at Virginia Tech: “Washington bureaucrats are not going to change the policies that deprive us of a normal human lifestyle.” As a student-government candidate more than four decades ago, Bannon flashed the kind of burn-the-place-down insurgent style and ideology that would define Trump’s ideological approach to running for president. His approach galvanized both campaigns and helped carry them to victory on election day.

Steve Bannon was elected president of the Virginia Tech Student Government Association in 1975 after he ran a campaign attacking both the university and the Washington establishments. In 2016, Bannon’s anti-Washington strategy drove Trump’s presidential campaign. Also pictured in this 1975 campaign flier is Bannon’s vice-presidential candidate, Susan Oliver.

# Hillary Clinton as Policy Wonk

If Bannon’s antiestablishment ideology helped define and power Trump’s campaign, Hillary Clinton, on the other side, was a candidate awash in policy detail and was arguably the chief policy wonk of her own campaign. Her record in public life was virtually without peer. Clinton had served as an activist first lady in the 1990s when she chaired President Bill Clinton’s White House task force on health care. She had served as a senator from New York and as secretary of state during Obama’s first term, and over three decades she had become one of America’s most authoritative policy minds. Whether the subject was the congressional budget process, health care reform, or US policies on trade, peace negotiations, or war virtually anywhere on the planet, Clinton had acquired an expertise that prepared her to serve as president of the United States. Like other such nominees who went on to _lose_ the White House, including George H. W. Bush (1992), Al Gore (2000), and John Kerry (2004), Clinton had exceptional qualifications and could have understood the nuanced policy dilemmas facing her in the Oval Office starting on the first day.

Yet her expertise was more political handicap than asset. She became the “policy wonk,” the embodiment of experience and knowledge, in the race against Donald Trump, when experience and knowledge seemed to not matter. Even her own aides were concerned with how the campaign against her insurgent primary rival, Bernie Sanders, was being framed. E-mails hacked by Russian intelligence and distributed by Wikileaks later revealed that her senior strategists worried that she was too much of a policy wonk and lacked an overarching idea or ideology about why she wanted to be president. “A month before Clinton launched her campaign, her aides worked to corral her well-known love for granular policy details into a message that would both capture her agenda and present a forward-looking, aspirational vision for her presidency,” the _Washington Post_ wrote in reference to revelations contained in the e-mails. About a year after her campaign had launched, Clinton’s chief strategist Joel Benenson e-mailed his colleagues, “Do we have any sense from her what she believes or wants her core message to be?”

Benenson lamented that Sanders’s identity as the anti–Wall Street candidate had more appeal than Clinton’s detailed policy wonk approach.4 In her campaign memoir _What Happened_, Clinton herself seemingly acknowledged this shortcoming. She lamented how she missed an opportunity to define herself as a candidate standing for something bold and aspirational. She could have adopted a policy idea that would have addressed the issue of income inequality and helped her match both Sanders’s and Trump’s pledges to enlarge the share of the economic pie reserved for the nation’s working class and poor. Clinton argued that such a bold stroke on her part might have become a definitional attribute of her candidacy—affirmatively answering, in a sense, Benenson’s question, what does she stand for? As she details in her memoir, Clinton considered calling her policy proposal “Alaska for America” and spent weeks evaluating it with her policy team:

> Before I ran for President, I read a book called _With Liberty and Dividends for All: How to Save Our Middle Class When Jobs Don’t Pay Enough_, by Peter Barnes, which explored the idea of creating a new fund that would use revenue from shared national resources to pay a dividend to every citizen, much like how the Alaska Permanent Fund distributes the state’s oil royalties every year. Shared national resources include oil and gas extracted from public lands and the public airwaves used by broadcasters and mobile phone companies, but that gets you only so far. If you view the nation’s financial system as a shared resource, then you can start raising real money from things like a financial transactions tax. Same with the air we breathe and carbon pricing.
> 
> Once you capitalize the fund, you can provide every American with a modest basic income every year. Besides cash in people’s pockets, it would also be a way of making every American feel more connected to our country and to one another—part of something bigger than ourselves. I was fascinated by this idea, as was my husband, and we spent weeks working with our policy team to see if it could be viable enough to include in my campaign. We would call it “Alaska for America.” Unfortunately, we couldn’t make the numbers work. To provide a meaningful dividend each year to every citizen, you’d have to raise enormous sums of money, and that would either mean a lot of new taxes or cannibalizing other important programs. We decided it was exciting but not realistic, and left it on the shelf. That was the responsible decision. I wonder now whether we should have thrown caution to the wind and embraced “Alaska for America” as a long-term goal and figured out the details later.5

Further, her campaign concluded that the idea would be hard to explain and sell to the electorate. “We dug deep, tried to explain it to some people, and it just was hard for people to grasp what we were talking about because most Americans in the Lower 48 didn’t have any idea about what was going on in Alaska,” Clinton told Vox in 2017.6 “In politics, if you can’t explain it and you can’t sell it, it stays on the shelf,” Hillary Clinton advised a group of Black Lives Matter activists during a conversation captured on video that went viral in 2016. This point is fair, and it is applicable to her campaign. If her campaign had been able to sell her candidacy and explain what she stood for in ways that matched Sanders’s and Trump’s simple themes and bold rationales; if her campaign could have conveyed her lifelong passion for helping people, and her vision for reinvigorating economic opportunity for all; if she had been able to answer Benenson’s question more effectively, she, not Trump, might have won the White House.7

That is certainly the argument that Stanley Greenberg makes in a searing postelection autopsy of the Clinton campaign. He argues that the inability of Clinton (and her manager, Robby Mook, whom he specifically calls out) to articulate a compelling economic message constituted political malpractice. He summed up his critique in an e-mail that he says he sent to top Clinton staff a few weeks before election day: “Yesterday, I’m sorry, could not have been worse on the economy. I just can’t understand why you feel the need to run on progress. You are the past and Trump is change and a better life. You sound clueless in blue collar America.”8

# Campaign Managers Avoiding the Policy Weeds

The 2012 Republican Party presidential nominee Mitt Romney told us in an interview that policy wonk should be one of the ten roles that a campaign manager plays, and his point was well taken. It’s true that campaigns are rarely if ever waged to determine which candidate has the most sophisticated and achievable policy proposals. Campaigns don’t in the main devote resources to persuading voters that Candidate A is a legislative whiz or that Candidate B has a deep knowledge of executive branch regulations and powers. Campaign managers tend to cast a weary eye on policy wonks lurking within their organizations. Jim Cauley, Barack Obama’s 2004 Senate campaign manager, explained how he chastised the candidate and some of his aides whenever they strayed deep into the policy weeds. “[Obama] used to get mad at me about policy because I’m about running the race and he [and his advisors] would sit there . . . in a room and just talk policy horseshit for hours and I’m like, Seriously? Go raise some money or knock on a door, do something that moves our ball down the field.”9 Joe Abbey, campaign manager on Creigh Deeds’s losing 2009 bid for Virginia governor, argued that candidates who were policy wonks had to be made less so through the campaign’s advertisements. Ultimately, candidates who detail their knowledge of legislative proposals and policy matters can fare less well than candidates who champion bold causes and clear ideologies.10

Policy is ultimately made by elected officials and not by their campaigns. (Still, it’s worth noting that how candidates run for office, especially the vows they make to voters, do shape their policies once they enter office.) Campaigns that get bogged down in policy minutiae risk the muddying of their messages and often have trouble communicating with voters about what they ultimately stand for. The big picture gets lost in the granular details; the bark on the trees may be visible, but not the forest. At the same time, as Romney suggested in his astute observation, policy (and ideology) matters to the outcome.

When it comes to opposition research, which refers to campaigns’ efforts to research the backgrounds and records of their own candidates and their opponents’ voting records and statements, policy plays a star role. As Brett DiRiesta, a leading Democratic researcher, has argued, opposition research involves the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information involving candidates’ past records including their votes on legislation and statements on public policy. Elected officials who have taken votes and spoken out on particular issues have often been subjected to withering attacks that can damage their public standing.

Running for reelection against Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, in 2004, George W. Bush assailed his opponent as a man who stood essentially for nothing. Kerry, Bush charged, voted for funding for the Iraq War before he voted against the funding. Kerry, Bush observed, had taken so many different positions on so many different policies that he went in any direction that he thought popular, “whichever way the wind blows.”11

Leaving aside votes for a moment, candidates’ statements about dicey policy matters are also often fodder for campaigns. During a heated Republican primary contest for the gubernatorial nomination of Virginia in 2017, supporters of the hard-right candidate Corey Stewart charged that rival Ed Gillespie supported taking down Confederate statues from public spaces. Gillespie’s campaign responded that Gillespie “has consistently opposed efforts to take down historical statues, including Civil War monuments,” and called Stewart’s attack a sign of desperation.12 This one debate, then, was “about” whether or not Gillespie had said he favored removing monuments celebrating the pro-slavery Confederate South from public spaces in Virginia. Gillespie, a Republican strategist and lobbyist, barely eked out a victory against the upstart Stewart in the GOP primary. The attacks on Gillespie’s comments, even though they were misleading, had an impact.

Democratic campaign manager Chris Durlak, who ran a state senate race in 2010, underscored how a candidate’s policy positions can be a rich target for opponents, but some rival campaigns miss their chances, and sometimes the media is also snoozing.

> One of the consultants is a really good guy. He’s done a lot of campaigns. He said to me, “God, you know, they should read our jobs plan. Because you want to talk about something that doesn’t make sense that you could really attack us on? Our jobs plan.” Our jobs plan, which we needed to just come up with very quickly, which as my friend pointed out, we’re obviously both liberal Democrats, he’s like, “It’s Reaganomics.” I mean, we’re talking about cutting taxes and that’s going to create jobs, and that’s kind of our jobs plan. And we were running ads on it and saying we’re going to create jobs and thousands of jobs. And no one, no media ever was like, _Hey, let’s analyze—what’s Chuck’s job plan?_ Because they don’t care. You know what I mean? So like you can do whatever you want on policy and make claims and I think it’s probably part of the reason why we’re in the problems we are today.13

Addisu Demissie, Corey Booker’s 2013 Senate campaign manager, observed that “people who fail in politics . . . are people who show up and think that they’re going to be running the show or that they’re going to be policy analysts or something like that when most campaigns are about knocking doors, writing press releases, raising money, very unglamorous things.”14 There are roles for policy wonks to play on campaigns, even if these positions are often second-tier to strategists, field organizers, fundraisers, and spokespeople. The chief function of a campaign policy wonk is to provide content to the candidate and her spokespersons, who must be able to answer questions on a broad range of policy topics and, ideally, spin the news stories to their liking. Many young people get involved in campaigns because they have strong feelings about an issue or a cause, and they want to do something to affect government outcomes on their issue. As David Axelrod told us, it’s very important for campaign staffers to have commitment to the issue positions of the candidate for whom they are working. But many political people who start out with a policy focus soon find themselves doing other kinds of campaign work.

# The Frustrated Policy Wonk

One example is Laura Quinn, the former deputy chief of staff for Vice President Gore and founder of the data analytics firm Catalist (for more on Catalist, see Chapter 3]]). Quinn studied international relations and economics and came to Washington ready to do serious policy work. “Frankly, I ended up doing campaign work because . . . the campaign side of things offered more senior jobs more quickly,” said Quinn, who started out in politics doing advance work because she’d been told that’s where the action was. On her first campaign, L.A. mayor Tom Bradley’s 1982 race for California governor, Quinn reflected that “we lost to George Deukmejian by a very, very tiny margin [1.19 percent]. . . . But having lost by such a narrow margin, that’s the most dangerous thing of all because then you really feel like, ‘I need to get back in there.’”15

Additionally, although some politicians prefer governing to campaigning because government is where they can actually change policy, many campaign professionals believe that by helping their candidates win elective office, they are influencing policy decisions and improving people’s lives. Gary Peters’s 2008 congressional campaign manager Julie Petrick observed, “The best way to effect change is to elect better people. . . . Sometimes, it’s 10:30 at night and I’ve been on the road for three weeks and I’m like, _Maybe I should go run a food bank_. And then I remember that if I elect somebody that’s going to get more funding to that food bank, then that’s the better way to do it.”16

Still, campaigns can be a frustrating place for the committed policy wonk. One problem is that some reporters don’t seem to care that much about covering a candidate’s issue positions. Brad Todd, a campaign veteran and founding partner at OnMessage, Inc., has a master’s degree in journalism, and he argued that campaign managers “can’t get the press to write policy-related stories that are on a positive scale.” Instead, most reporters were writing “process stories and . . . gotcha stories. And if you got one of those two things to peddle, you could get it.” Getting positive press for one’s candidate is “very hard, so you end up managing bad news or getting bad news for your opponent.”17

One example cited by Todd was a gubernatorial campaign on which he consulted.

> [We] had policy councils on every area of state policy. And we had rock stars on these policy councils. People who had been cabinet secretaries before, CEOs, generals, you name it. Rock stars. And we would do a press conference with these people who were—really you were looking at the face of the future government. You know, you were looking at future cabinet people, future commissioners, future chief advisers, and something very newsworthy. And they were sitting there talking about potential policy options. We did six or seven of these policy council press conferences and got maybe one or two stories out of all of them. And it was substantive, significant news, but there’s just—a journalist can’t sell that to his editor anymore. The news hole shrunk and they just can’t sell it.18
> 
> —Brad Todd, OnMessage, Inc.

At times, then, campaign managers found that the media-driven policy debate was simply out of their control—and less about policy and ideas than sensationalistic bits to spark reader interest. In his book _Out of Order_, Thomas E. Patterson observed that the media’s appetite for controversy defined Vice President Dan Quayle’s effort to help George H. W. Bush win a second term during the 1992 campaign. Early in 1992, Quayle was set to give a speech on family values that touched on abortion, race, poverty, and work. At the last minute, according to Patterson, Quayle penciled in a line about the television character Murphy Brown, a single working mother portrayed by Candice Bergen. “It doesn’t help matters when prime-time TV has Murphy Brown . . . mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another ‘lifestyle choice,’” Quayle said.19

That sentence produced an unintended firestorm. Every other element of Quayle’s speech was ignored, but his Murphy Brown comment produced headline after headline in national newspapers, because it was socially provocative. Patterson argued that “the sensational is favored over the routine.” (Patterson added that during the 1980 campaign, the media offered up seven times as many stories about President Carter’s oft-inebriated brother Billy than they did about the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union.)20

This raises another question: Did the media coverage affect the election outcome? Did it hinder the ability of candidates to enact their policy agendas and fulfill their ideological promises once they entered office? According to the campaign managers we talked to, yes. The coverage mattered by shaping how voters regarded the candidates and how they understood the arguments from both sides about why they deserved to win elected office. The real driver of campaign coverage, managers told us, was horse race–related tidbits, poll results, fundraising news, endorsements, and gaffes. Thus, the media coverage drove some of the ways in which voters identified candidates with standing for a particular issue or larger set of causes and ideas.

From the vantage point of campaign managers, who are trying to push their policy stances and tar the opposition through earned media, there were too few political reporters, with too little experience on the trail. And, they said, the fierce competition for speed and eyeballs resulted in stories that were increasingly sensational. One campaign manager told us that “there’s too much news and too few reporters,” who, on the whole, give credence to all arguments whether or not they were even based in fact. Brad Todd echoed that campaign reporters were young and “stretched . . . thin. . . . The press corps as a whole,” he said, “does not have the level of experience, campaign exposure, and expertise that we had several years ago. And that is a real problem for campaigns, especially if you’re trying to communicate something complicated.”21

Their most effective strategies for generating news coverage, they said, involved creative ploys that would pique the interest of editors and reporters. But the tricks had to underscore some aspect of the campaign’s core message or issue positions; they couldn’t simply be divorced from what the campaigns were telling the voters. Creative stunts enabled campaign managers to “break through.”

Take, for example, Casey Phillips’s policy-related gimmick when he managed Delbert Hosemann’s 2007 Mississippi secretary of state campaign. Hosemann had proposed a sweeping reform of the state’s business laws, which hadn’t been updated for decades and were woefully inadequate to the task at hand. It was an issue about which Hosemann was passionate. But caring about a policy idea important to his potential constituents wasn’t sufficient to reach voters. So, armed with a six-page white paper and a deep knowledge of the policy, Hosemann crisscrossed Mississippi, talking to editorial boards, seeking to gain coverage for his reform idea. Reporters and editors greeted his proposal with a collective yawn; the idea, they told Phillips, simply wasn’t terribly exciting. That’s when Phillips came up with a strategy: He went on eBay. He told us he “bought a 1983 Nokia cell phone that came with a backpack basically and a charger and . . . this crank.” And he gave the old phone to Hosemann along with an iPhone, and the candidate began to hold up the Nokia phone and say, “This was business in ’83.” Then, he’d hold up the iPhone and say, “This is business today. This is why it needs to [change].” The gimmick, Phillips recalled, “actually got us some stories.” The key to making a message or policy proposal stick, said Phillips, was to find a novel way to generate public attention—to give local newspapers and other outlets sexy and engaging ways to convey the campaign’s substantive policies and message. Thus, it was the combination of a policy idea and a campaign gimmick that enabled Hosemann to reach at least some voters with a sense of what he stood for and why he wanted to be secretary of state.22

Earlier in this chapter, we described how Virginia gubernatorial candidate Gillespie was attacked by his Republican primary opponent on the issue of Confederate monuments. In the final days of the 2017 campaign for governor of Virginia, Gillespie did the same thing to his Democratic general election opponent, running hard-hitting ads attacking Democrat Ralph Northam’s positions on Confederate monuments and sanctuary cities. Gillespie charged that Northam would tear down the state’s heritage and unleash undocumented immigrants in Virginia’s metropolitan areas.23 The ads didn’t work; Northam defeated Gillespie by 9 points on election day. Yet the spots underscore the extent to which policy and ideology inform each side’s strategies, arguments, and voter outreach programs. In the race’s closing days, Gillespie was trying to reposition himself as a Trump-like nationalist candidate running on an anti-immigrant, pro-Confederate monument platform. These positions conflicted with his long record in public life, but his late-stage bid to appeal to Trump voters was rooted in policy and defined his closing argument about his ideology around hot-button cultural issues. Put differently, Gillespie put his case to the electorate by framing his ideology and policy views vis-à-vis Northam’s. Voters rejected the Republican by a wide margin, and this result, in part, reflected the rejection of his hard-right ideological approach that seemed to come from nowhere in the campaign’s final weeks. In the Gillespie–Northam contest, policy and ideology, far from being incidental to the campaign debate, were core elements in each side’s efforts to mobilize base supporters and persuade any undecided voters to support one candidate or the other.

# 7 Marketing Maven Reaching the Campaign’s Target Audiences

**A** Washington, D.C., suburb, Alexandria, Virginia, is the Silicon Valley of professional politics. Working and living here you will find many of the country’s leading pollsters, consultants, and TV ad makers along with a new generation of digital and big-data wizards. A few miles down Fort Hunt Road past Alexandria’s Belle Haven Country Club, Democratic media planner Danny Jester and Republican media planner Ben Angle live just six blocks apart. Friends, Jester and Angle enjoy getting together with one another and their young families. Unfortunately, they were too busy for neighborhood socializing in the election year of 2016. Jester, a media buying veteran of three Democratic presidential campaigns, was working late and weekends as he directed Hillary Clinton’s television and radio spending during the primary and general election campaigns.

Angle was also busy doing media planning and buying for his agency’s Republican clients.1 In mid-September, on the recommendation of their longtime clients at the Republican National Committee, Angle and his boss were summoned to Trump Tower and told their firm would be placing all of the Trump campaign’s television advertising during the last seven weeks of the campaign. Angle and Jester would face off against one another in the daily presidential advertising slugfest and, by election day, the two friends would spend a combined $450 million, nearly all of it on traditional broadcast and cable television spots. Even with the rise in digital media consumption (see Chapter 9]]), today’s campaign managers—from presidential to local—still value television above any other media tool. That’s why television is the primary focus of this chapter.

# “What Are They Doing?” Competitive Media Tracking in the 2016 Presidential Race

Jester and Angle wouldn’t see one another during the fall campaign, but they were keeping watchful eyes on each other’s presidential TV activities. All campaigns try to track their opponent’s advertising. For local campaigns, this can simply mean watching or listening to their opponent’s spots on TV and radio, along with calling or visiting local broadcast outlets and cable systems for information about the opposition’s media orders.2 The competitive tracking job becomes more complex for campaigns spread across multiple media markets. The job is most complex for presidential campaigns that must track advertising in media markets across multiple states—tracking not only swing-market local advertising but also the more expensive national spots placed on television broadcast and cable channels that reach the whole country.

**Friendly rivals.** Danny Jester (right) handled media placement for the Clinton campaign in 2016. His friend and neighbor Ben Angle (left) did the same for the Donald Trump campaign. Between them, they spent nearly $450 million on behalf of their two candidates. Here they swap post-campaign war stories.

Jester’s firm started its competitive tracking operation in 2015 at the beginning of Clinton’s presidential primary campaign against Democratic opponent Bernie Sanders. “We had a team of five or six people,” says Jester. “Our top goals were tracking ad content [what ads were being aired] and estimated spending and media weight behind each ad in each market. We’d also look at the programs they were buying and then try to figure out who they were targeting with a particular ad.”3 In addition to the presidential candidate campaigns, the team followed advertising by third-party super PACs trying to influence the election as well as advertising in dozens of key gubernatorial, Senate, and congressional races across the country. “We are interested in what our share of voice [percentage of total political advertising] is in each media market,” Jester said.

Jester’s team maintained a tracking database updated continuously during the day and produced reports on trends and the latest developments for Clinton’s senior campaign management staff in her Brooklyn, New York, national headquarters. “The Clinton folks all had experience on previous presidential campaigns and so they were very interested in benchmarks on a day-to-day basis,” says Jester. “Key things like how much are we spending and how much are they spending in each market? Do we need to increase our spending here? Do we need to be worried here?”

![[45.jpeg]]

**Example of a political TV tracking dashboard.** Like all large political media agencies, both Clinton’s media agency, GMMB, and Trump’s media agency, AMAG, assumed the costs of providing their clients with competitive tracking data, analysis, and up-to-the minute reporting.

Angle’s Republican firm employed a comparable tracking staff and database reporting system, but it had focused mainly on competitive congressional and statewide elections. “When we got the assignment in September from Trump Tower, we geared up our national presidential coverage,” says Angle. Both Jester’s and Angle’s agencies had secure websites where clients could log in to see the latest competitive information, and both provided e-mails alerting clients when new creatives or buys were detected.

Both campaigns were making decisions based largely on the same two competitive data sources:

1. **Advertising dollars placed by the opposition campaign and by third-party PACs:** Media salespeople in local markets send e-mails to both Democratic and Republican media agencies almost immediately when they get a political media order. “It would be like Pepsi and Coke getting constant reports on what the other brand is doing,” says Angle. “Our [political] ad world is different because the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] says our ad orders with these local stations must be made public.” These heads-up e-mails from TV salespeople show the days the advertising will run and the gross amount of advertising ordered but do not show what programs were ordered. Campaigns learn that from the next source.
2. **Monitoring what ads are running, where, and how often:** Both Jester’s and Angle’s agency used ad monitoring data delivered online by the Campaign Media Analysis Group [CMAG], a unit of Kantar Research that provides ad monitoring services to consumer advertisers. Kantar computers continually watch for ads on local television in media markets across the country. Whenever an ad appears, the Kantar network compares its electronic profile to all the other ads in the Kantar database. If a new political spot is detected, a digital copy of the video is sent to CMAG where analysts tag the ad for its sponsor, the relevant election, and other attributes. Quickly after the new ad’s first airing, an e-mail “ad alert” is generated and sent to relevant CMAG subscribers with a link to new video. The new spot is added to CMAG’s database, and all future airings of the spot are tracked by market, station name, time of airing, program name, estimated audience size, and other variables Each day, Jester’s and Angle’s competitive teams would download large CMAG files of thousands of ad occurrences, process the data, and add it to their own competitive tracking and reporting databases.

Competitive tracking is a vital tool for modern campaigns, but both Angle and Jester told us about situations where campaigns have paid too much attention to the tracking and made expensive media mistakes. One such example comes from a media buyer who prefers to remain anonymous. Her client was a very well-funded congressional candidate in a large and expensive TV market that included six congressional districts. Her client was running in one of them.

“Most of the [TV] impressions you buy in these big markets are going to be seen by people who can’t even vote in the target district,” says the buyer. The buyer’s candidate had an extremely heavy TV buy, so the media buyer advised his client to put any new funds into other more highly targetable media like digital or radio to reach light TV users. Instead, the client—who was looking at the daily competitive tracking—insisted on raising his TV spending to match all increases in the opposition’s TV buys. “My advice would’ve cost us money,” said the buyer. The media buyer didn’t lose any business, but her client lost the election by 3.5 percent, close enough that a more diversified media mix might have made a difference. Toward the end of this campaign, the candidate and his manager were insisting on an unheard-of TV weight of 5,000 gross rating points (GRPs) per week. “They didn’t even know what a GRP is!” complains the buyer.4

# What Are Gross Rating Points? Learning the Basic Math of Media

Campaign managers must be generalists and can’t be expected to be experts in media research and planning. But if managers are responsible for approving expensive advertising budgets, they need to know what a GRP really is. Very few of the campaign managers and political pros we’ve talked to are able to offer the correct definition. A typical response:

> I don’t feel like I really ever have asked the media consultant exactly what GRPs are. I just know the numbers and what’s good and what’s bad. I knew that 1,000 GRPs meant twice as much television and money as 500 GRPs, but I never asked anyone what a GRP actually was. I was probably embarrassed that I didn’t really know, and it didn’t seem that important to get bogged down in the technical details. That was the media consultant’s job.5

These so-called “technical details” of political advertising budgets lack the sex appeal of the creative ad-making process. Put differently, “What do we tell them?” (ad content) receives the lion’s share of media and scholarly coverage, whereas “How do we reach them?” (ad-buying strategy) remains a distant and misunderstood cousin among political observers, scholars, and practitioners. Unsurprisingly, most campaign managers would rather develop a blockbuster ad that blows up the race rather than do the numbers on a cost-effective media plan. Yet, with often multimillion-dollar media budgets under their control, effective managers must learn the quantitative details of how television and other media are measured, sold, and bought, as well as how to integrate voter media targeting into their media plans. As Chapter 2]] demonstrated, the margins matter by fundamentals, turnout, and performance, so even a slight edge in the ad wars can boost turnout and/or persuade some voters to vote for or against a side, potentially making the difference between defeat and victory. Campaigns that understand the media concepts in Box 7.1 will spend their resources wisely and more effectively target their messages to the right voters in the hopes of gaining separation from their opponents.

What are GRPs actually? GRPs are percentage points—400 GRPs means 400 percent. Here’s how it works: Let’s say we are in a media market with an adult population of 1 million people who are above the age of eighteen and eligible to vote, and assume our advertising campaign is targeting all of them. During the week, we paid for 200 thirty-second TV spots that generated 4,000,000 adult advertising “impressions,” defined as _opportunities_ for adults to be exposed to our advertising (they don’t have to pay any attention to get counted as a potential impression). To turn impressions into GRPs, our 4,000,000 adult impressions are divided by the adult population of 1,000,000, which equals 4.00, or 400 percent, giving us 400 adult gross rating points. The fundamental concepts of impressions and gross rating points are most often associated with television but can also be used to describe digital, radio, print, and nearly any other form of media where impressions can be measured or estimated.

Box 7.1 Basic Media Vocabulary

These are some of the key concepts campaign managers are expected to learn in order to communicate effectively with their media buyers and ad makers. Our examples here use television, where most political ad dollars are spent, but all these metrics are also used in the digital media industry.

**Impressions:** An impression is said to occur each time a person _has the opportunity to be exposed to an ad_. Impressions are most often expressed as thousands (000’s). For example, the “Metro City” local news broadcast on channel 5 averages 7,500 adult (eighteen and up) viewers from 5:00 to 5:30 p.m., according to Nielsen. An ad on the show is described as delivering 7,500 adult impressions whether or not that many people actually saw the ad or paid attention to it.

**Program rating:** Ratings are the audience size expressed as a percentage of a given population. The adult eighteen-and-over population of Metro City is 500,000. Metro City channel 5 local news averages 7,500 adult (eighteen and up) viewers from 5:00 to 5:30 p.m., so Nielsen gives the program a 2.5 rating among adults eighteen and up (7,500 audience divided by 500,000 population = 2.5 percent).

**Gross rating points:** GRPs are the sum of all program rating points in an advertising schedule. Mathematically, a schedule of 1,000 GRPs means that ad impressions equal 1,000 percent of the target population. For example, Metro City has an eighteen-and-up adult population of 500,000. If a Metro City advertiser buys 500,000 ad impressions, it has 100 A18+ GRPs (500,000 impressions equal 100 percent of the population). If the advertiser buys 5,000,000 impressions, it has 1,000 GRPs.

**Cost per thousand (CPM):** This is the cost to make 1,000 impressions. CPMs are used to compare media vehicle or program efficiencies in terms of costs. A $15 CPM means that for every $15 spent in the defined media, the media plan will generate an average 1,000 impressions among a defined population.

**Cost per point (CPP):** This is the cost to reach 1 percent of a given population. Similar to CPM, CPPs are derived by dividing a media cost by its respective rating. For instance, if a thirty-second TV spot costs $800 and has an adult (A18+) rating of 5.0, then the A18+ CPP is $160 (i.e., $800 divided by 5 = $160).

**Reach:** Reach is the percentage of a given population that has the opportunity to be exposed to an ad at least one time. A 1,000 GRP schedule might produce a target audience reach of 90 percent, meaning that 90 percent of the target population was exposed or had the opportunity to be exposed at least one time.

**Frequency:** Frequency describes the average number of times people will have the opportunity to be exposed to an ad. Many people will be exposed above and below the average. A 1,000 GRP schedule in a particular media market might have a reach of 85 to 95 percent with an average frequency of roughly ten to twelve exposures (_Reach * Frequency = GRPs_). The average frequency number can be misleading—significant percentages of people will be exposed much less often and others exposed much more often.

**Demo (Demographic):** Media users can be measured and categorized in many ways. In media-speak, “demo” traditionally referred to age and sex characteristics of an audience because age and sex are the two demographic variables always reported by ratings companies like Nielsen. Advertising schedules that want to reach voters might focus on all adults over the age of eighteen, expressed as Adults 18+, or A18+. Other examples are W25–54 (women ages twenty-five to fifty-four) or M18–34 (men ages eighteen to thirty-four). Because older people are more likely to vote, A35+ has been the traditional political target demo, although some political media planners have turned to younger target demos such as A35–64 to avoid overdelivering older audiences who typically watch much more television.

**Target audience ratings points:** New data methodologies are enabling political advertisers to directly target different categories of voters without relying on traditional age-sex demographics. Political target audiences are expressed in terms of partisanship and voter turnout—for example, a campaign might target W18+ who are high-turnout independents or soft party leaners. These estimated target impressions can be expressed as target audience ratings points (TARPs). Target audience impressions divided by target audience population = TARPs.

To repeat, GRPs are actually percentage points. But there is no such thing as generic GRPs. When people talk about GRPs in a campaign meeting or conference call, the manager is responsible for making sure the media consultants are clear about what kind of GRPs or “points” they are talking about. Are they talking about adult eighteen-and-over points; adult thirty-five to sixty-four points; household points; high-turnout voter points; or independent, Democratic, or Republican points? A given TV plan will deliver significantly different GRP levels for each of these groups. Most political media consultants have liked to target big age or gender groups—adults thirty-five and over is the most common political demographic—because this traditional approach is easier for media buyers to execute. But new research methods make it possible to move beyond simple demographics and more accurately target actual voters to generate higher target voter GRP levels for each media dollar spent.

# How Many GRPs Do We Have?

Campaign managers are always asking their media buyers and ad makers, “How many points do we have?” Media planners tell us there are many correct answers to the question. Here’s a quick example from a nonpartisan ballot measure campaign in Florida.

Media planner Ellen Robinson had just finished her first media buy for a campaign manager. “He was very experienced . . . but the only kind of GRP he’d ever heard about or talked about was thirty-five plus,” remembers Robinson.6 She was more interested in buying targeted TARPs than broad-brush A35+ GRPs. Robinson prepared an analysis of her West Palm Beach buy to show the campaign manager the difference (see Table 7.1]]). Instead of targeting a standard Nielsen age-gender demographic, Robinson targeted high-turnout voters including Republicans and Democrats. She used media research data showing which programs were more likely to be watched by high-turnout voters. Robinson’s TV schedule of 297 thirty-second spots would overdeliver an estimated 1,300 TARPs compared to 850 A18+ GRPs and 1,010 A35+ GRPs, the campaign manager’s benchmark demo.

“We call the difference between the TARPs and A18+ GRPs the ‘efficiency gain,’” says Robinson, who, by this measure, scored a 53 percent gain in efficiency. To hone in on her target high-turnout voters, Robinson used data purchased from Nielsen Scarborough, which surveys over 200,000 American adults annually about their consumer, media, political, and other behaviors along with their demographics.7 (Both the Clinton and Trump media agencies used Nielsen Scarborough in 2016.)8 Robinson used the data from the West Palm Beach DMA (media market) to identify television programs with high percentages of likely voters in their audiences. As she put her buy together, she also wanted to keep a balance between programs, such as _Jeopardy_, that were more likely to be watched by Democrats and those where viewers leaned Republican, such as NBC’s _Dateline_ (see Figure 7.1]]). Robinson’s client won in November.

# How Many Gross Rating Points Do I Need?

“How many GRPs do I need in order to reach them?” This bottom-line media question is asked and reasked by every campaign manager. There is no simple, universal answer. Before a campaign can even try to answer that question, it’s necessary to understand what actually happens when a campaign buys GRPs.

The conventional wisdom is that a political television spot needs at least 1,000 GRPs to be effective, according to our conversations with campaign managers. The ideal rule of thumb most often repeated over the years in campaign meetings was to run one spot for seven days with at least 1,000 GRPs per week, heavier than nearly any consumer advertising blitz. Then a new spot would be rotated in for at least another 1,000 GRPs.

For example, let’s say we have a new thirty-second TV spot and have purchased 1,000 target GRPs to show it over the next seven days. Our impressions will be 1,000 percent of our target audience, so we might assume that we have reached 100 percent of the target ten times each (100 percent reach times 10 average frequency = 1,000 GRPs). But everybody doesn’t see our ad ten times. About 20 percent to 25 percent of adults will see our ad twenty-plus times during the week (and possibly get annoyed) whereas about 5 percent won’t see it all. These exposure levels—what percentage of the target is _reached_ and at what _frequency_—are called the _reach and frequency distribution_. As an example, Figure 7.2]] is a reach and frequency distribution for a television schedule in the St. Louis DMA.

As Figure 7.2]] shows, our buy reaches 94 percent of adults, meaning nearly all of them have had the opportunity to see our television ad at least once. The average number of opportunities to see our ad—the average frequency—is 10.25 for the entire A18+ population. The average frequency can be highly misleading. There is a huge variance in voters’ levels of exposure to our television advertising simply because some people watch more television and some people watch less.9 Many political professionals have traditionally talked about the need to “burn in a message” on television, but that approach cannot work with voters who are lighter television users. In our St. Louis buy, those who are most “burned” are the unfortunate 28 percent who have been exposed to our ads thirteen or more times over the course of a week. Slightly less burned are the 18 percent in the eight-to-twelve exposure group. Least exposed are the 48 percent who have had the opportunity to see the ad one to seven times.10

Campaign managers hate hearing “I see our opponent’s ads all the time, but I never see ours!” This complaint, unfortunately, is most likely to be voiced by the candidate’s spouse, the candidate’s friends, and large financial supporters. “Sometimes it’s October and the candidate or the spouse is on the phone with me asking about their six o’clock news schedule, and I’m thinking they should have something more important to do,” said one political media buyer. Another manager recalled how a California candidate’s wife complained about always seeing the opponent’s commercials but never her husband’s. The manager found out that the wife watched MSNBC each morning while working out. The media buyer began to insert spots daily during the morning workout hour, a hypertargeted buy at an audience of one. Because the campaign only bought the cable system around the candidate’s house, the spots weren’t that expensive and the complaints stopped.

Ultimately, to reach those who may be underexposed and pressed for time, political campaigns end up spending much more each week than a consumer advertiser ever would. But how do campaign managers decide how much volume to put on the air at any given moment?

Having a rule of thumb is useful when it comes time for campaign managers to plan the advertising budget. For example, the campaign manager might estimate that she will be able to afford roughly 8,000 television GRPs with adults age thirty-five to sixty-four over the course of the campaign. If she, depending on her campaign media consultants, wants to have 1,000 points behind each TV spot, that means she will need to budget for production of eight ready-to-air spots. On the other hand, if the campaign manager believes that most television spots began to “wear out” after 400 to 700 GRPs, she would budget for and produce a higher number of spots. The campaign manager typically hopes to arrive at some consensus with her advertising consultant about how many spots will need to be produced over the course of a campaign and how much time and resources the consultant can expect to provide.

**An example of a reach and frequency distribution.** The horizontal axis shows the number of exposures and the bars the percentage of the adult population exposed at that level. For example, there were zero exposures received by an estimated 6.3 percent of adults, meaning that 94 percent of adults were exposed at least once. In media-speak, this means the buy had a total reach of 94 percent with 48 percent exposed one to seven times, 18 percent eight to twelve times, and 28 percent thirteen-plus times. This last group of heavy TV viewers consumed 64 percent of all ad impressions delivered.

According to some of the managers who spoke to us, not all ad placements need to reach 1,000 points. Paul Tencher, who managed Joe Donnelly’s (D-IN) 2012 US Senate campaign, recounted how their campaign “made the gamble . . . to go up on television very, very early.”11 Even though they were buying fewer than 250 points in most of the state’s media markets, their ads were reaching the voters because “we were all by ourselves in all of July, all of August. I mean, Joe and I would say to each other every day, yeah, we won another day.”12 But then again, depending on the state or district and what’s happening in the world, even 1,000 GRPs “might not necessarily get heard,” said Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager.13 Ultimately, there is no one-size-fits-all answer.

It is beyond the scope of this book to settle the metaphysical questions of how much weight should be put behind a particular TV ad or how many times a voter must see ads in order for them to be effective. Billion-dollar consumer advertisers have spent millions trying to answer these questions for years but never seem to reach consensus. Campaign managers will spend many hours in meetings with their hired media experts and pollsters arguing whether there have been “enough points behind a spot” and when the next spot should be prepared and deployed. At the same time, campaign managers also strive to look beyond these details and see television and other forms of advertising within the big-picture context of their overall communications strategy.

Campaign managers we’ve interviewed remind us that political campaigns are more than TV ads. Television advertising is a critically important function, but the candidate’s message is also communicated through door knocking, social media, phone calls, radio, e-mail, events, candidate appearances, news coverage, and other channels. The campaign message must be managed across all these platforms. And in some instances, as campaign manager Robby Mook told us, television is simply not a realistic option for a campaign due to budget constraints.14 Mook argued that if the campaign’s budget was unable to cover the costs of television advertising, the campaign’s strategists simply had to find alternative ways to reach their vote targets:

> You do your research and you figure out, okay, I know I need to communicate X, Y, and Z to win this race. I know I’m going to win them over if I do that. So what tactics fit within my budget to get that job done? And sometimes TV isn’t going to fit in there. Sometimes TV fits in quite nicely and that’s all you need to do. . . . It just depends.15

Let’s pause for a moment and think back to the campaign manager model that appeared at the end of Chapter 1]]. As Figure 7.3]] reminds us, political campaigns are about so much more than just marketing the candidate’s message over the television airwaves. And yet, for those campaigns that can afford it, television ads enable a campaign to reach persuadable voters, especially in campaigns waged in the nation’s biggest states with multiple media markets. Old-fashioned televised ads remain the most popular method of political communication in almost every campaign, although, as we discuss later, digital vendors want to take a bigger bite out of traditional television’s share of the political ad market.

# The Enduring Love of Traditional Television in the Digital Age

In answering the “How do we reach them?” question, the paradoxical fact is that campaigns devote the vast majority of their budgets to local broadcast and cable television, so-called old media, despite the growing ubiquity and power of digital communications. Many campaigns continue to use over-the-air radio, a 100-year-old technology, to reach key demographics and for final get-out-the-vote (GOTV) pushes. The oldest media, newspapers, are still used by candidates for local office. Why would campaign managers rely on such seemingly outdated communication tools? Wouldn’t they be better off using more highly targetable new media like Facebook, Google, Twitter, e-mail, and Hulu to reach their voters? Couldn’t they spend more of their millions more wisely on something besides television?

The fact is that most campaign managers still see television advertising as their most powerful tool to reach voters. You’re not “real” until you’re on TV, they argued.16 And early in a campaign, they reported, just “being on TV” can build credibility among political activists and donors, and with the news media and opinion leaders.17 Late in a campaign, broadcast television is also the quickest way to reach the largest numbers of potential voters, they added.18 Unlike the new digital media, television has a long and rich political history, and nearly every campaign professional has a TV story to tell about a past campaign.

![[49.jpeg]]

Figure 7.3 What Campaigns Do: A Model

Traditional TV advertising is just one of several communication channels available to campaigns. TV still captures the majority of campaign spending despite the growth of digital media. Compared to heavy digital media users, heavy traditional TV viewers are older, which means they are more likely to turn out to vote in elections.

One such story is about Barack Obama before he became a household name. When he was running for US Senate in Illinois, he was still a state senator struggling for recognition amid a crowded Democratic primary field. His campaign manager, Jimmy Cauley, budgeted enough funds to spend heavily on television ads in the expensive Chicago media market starting three weeks before the primary election.19 And those spots made Obama a public figure—at least in the Windy City.

“Jimmy, people noticed me in the store the other day,” a startled Obama told Cauley.

“Yeah,” replied Cauley matter-of-factly. “You’re on at about a thousand [GRPs per week] in the Chicago media market. Of course, they do.”20

Campaign managers typically described broadcast television as hands-down the best, most useful form of political communication in any competitive race. Matthew Arnold, who managed Democrat Doug Gansler’s campaign for governor in Maryland in 2014, told us that “[broadcast television is] the thing that moves people. It’s the thing that wakes people up to your election. It’s incredibly important, incredibly valuable. It is what establishes the frame around your race.”21 Brad Beychok, who ran Charlie Melancon’s (D-LA) 2010 Senate campaign, echoed Arnold. “What we would try to do is set our polling schedule to coincide with the ad schedule. . . . After we maybe did 3,000 points and 4,000 points in, then you can go kind of see what that ad did by taking a trend poll . . . good campaigns are able to maximize their data,” tracking the effects of televised advertising on the electorate.22

Figuring out the most effective way to reach voter targets over the air is among the least appreciated and most misunderstood features of campaigns and elections. Typically, the media considers the mechanics of selling and buying television ads less consequential than, say, the ads themselves, rallies, gaffes, and other sensational events.

But the news media errs when it skates past the subject of ad buying. Campaigns use the basic statistics of media, track voters’ use of a wide variety of media platforms, and figure out how to reach voters most efficiently through these platforms. Large voter files are matched against viewing data collected from cable and satellite boxes. They conduct media research; estimate cash flows and media cost forecasts; track television audiences through Nielsen and other services; and run field experiments to determine when, where, and how much they should run television ads. Such decisions take on special importance in the biggest states, where television, managers agree, is still by far the most effective communications platform. The bottom line is that a campaign that creates a compelling and persuasive TV spot has to match that creativity with a smart television spending plan that works with the campaign’s other media channels. Campaigns that leverage ad buying to their advantage can achieve separation from their opponents, thus having an impact on the electoral margins.

# The Business of Political TV Advertising

Almost everyone claims to hate political advertising—except for the owners and sales staffers of local television stations, cable systems, radio stations, websites, and newspapers. They love it. “It’s a Christmas that comes at least every two years, and Santa Claus really shows up in presidential years,” said a salesman who works for a group of local television stations, many of which happen to be located in presidential battleground states.

Campaign managers who understand the business of local television advertising will have a competitive edge over those who do not.23 For example, states with small geographic areas, like New Hampshire, are allocated relatively few broadcast television licenses. WMUR, an ABC affiliate in Manchester, New Hampshire, enjoys near-monopoly status in the state. Its only other major broadcast competitors are located in Boston, where a television spot typically costs ten times as much as a spot on WMUR. During New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary campaigns for the major-party presidential nominations, spots on WMUR are a limited-supply commodity coveted by campaigns.

Campaign managers planning ahead for their media budgets must recognize that television advertising is a market driven by supply and demand.24 The result is that political advertisers, competing for scarce ad time, always bid up the price of spots as an election approaches. This is especially true on stations with limited local competition such as Manchester, New Hampshire’s, WMUR. As Figure 7.4]] shows, a candidate spot bought on WMUR in the week before the New Hampshire presidential primary can cost more than twice as much as a spot bought during the same period in a nonpresidential year.

Under rules established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), television stations are required to offer candidates for federal office something known as the “lowest unit rate,” or LUR. The LUR is the amount a station claims it charges its best advertisers, for example, a large local automobile dealership. Stations are not required to disclose what they charge their best advertisers, so campaigns must trust the station’s LUR pricing. The LUR rule goes into effect forty-five days before a primary election and sixty days before a general election.

Noncandidate advertisers, like the Democratic Priorities USA or the Republican Crossroads GPS super PACs, do not qualify for the LUR. They are required to pay so-called “issue rates,” which in the 2016 presidential campaign ended up being three to five times more expensive than the LURs charged to candidates. For this reason, television stations have a financial fondness for independent expenditure advertising (which consists typically of negative spots) run by these organizations. Viewers may complain about the high volume of negative ads, but TV stations don’t—noncandidate advertising can be one of the most profitable revenue streams enjoyed by local TV stations.25

![[50.jpeg]]

Figure 7.4 Political Advertisers Bid Up WMUR Rates during 2007–2008 Presidential Primary Campaign

**Local TV costs rise with demand as elections near.** This example shows the cost per rating point that presidential candidate Mitt Romney paid WMUR in Manchester, New Hampshire, during the 2007–2008 GOP primary. Broadcasters like WMUR are legally required to charge federal office candidates the “lowest unit rate” they give their best consumer advertisers. Stations are free to charge noncandidate political advertisers like super PACs rates that can be four times or more the rate that the station charges candidates.

As we have seen in the case of WMUR, the lowest unit rule does not prevent candidate LUR advertising rates from rising over the course of an election. Campaign managers need to plan for this cost inflation when they develop their television advertising budgets. The amount of advertising time or “inventory” a station has to sell is relatively finite, so as with every other sort of commodity, rising demand for time drives up the price. The law ensures that candidates pay lower rates than other types of political advertisers, but those rates still rise through the summer and fall of an election year. Campaigns can buy airtime early—for example, a campaign in June can buy time in October—but the campaign might still be asked to pay any difference between the rate at which they reserved the time and the rate at which the station ultimately is selling it. As a general rule, the longer a campaign waits to buy airtime, the more it will pay.

Campaigns buy local TV advertising instead of national network advertising with one exception: presidential elections. Historically, presidential campaigns have emphasized national network advertising, first on radio networks and then on television networks where it was a common practice to buy half-hour blocks of prime-time for candidate speeches. (Richard Nixon’s 1952 “Checkers” speech and Ronald Reagan’s 1964 “A Time for Choosing” speech both appeared on network broadcast television, to cite two examples.) Local spot market advertising was relegated to a secondary role and used to “heavy-up” media exposure in swing states media markets.

But that changed in 1992 when victorious challenger Bill Clinton focused on spot advertising in battleground states, while the incumbent president George H. W. Bush spent more heavily on national network ad buys.26 Since then, presidential advertising wars have been fought almost completely in the local media markets of key swing states with only a low percentage of TV spending directed to network broadcast or cable television.

Network advertising made a strong comeback in the 2016 presidential contest. “Crazy high local TV prices in target [local] markets made it cheaper to buy the whole country [on the network]. You save money on reaching the key [swing state] markets and then you get the rest of the country for free,” says Ben Angle, who did the network buying for the Trump campaign. Network buys also take less time to execute than buying market by market across dozens of targeted DMAs. When Angle’s agency got the last-minute buying assignment from Trump in mid-September, Angle says he used network spots to get on the air quickly while local market plans could be implemented. Trump supporters and donors in noncompetitive states like Texas (safe Republican) and California (safe Democrat) began seeing their first Trump spots.

Buying media for the Clinton campaign, Danny Jester had also recognized the value of network TV. Jester wanted Clinton ads to be shown during the 2016 Summer Olympics, which would be watched by high-turnout voters, according to their research. Local NBC stations were charging premium prices for the few local insertions they were allocated in prime-time, so Jester and the Clinton campaign negotiated a multimillion-dollar Olympics package directly with the NBC Sports Network, bypassing the local NBC affiliates. Jester, with an eye on Trump, continued to increase Clinton’s network TV spending. Each campaign ended up spending about 25 percent of their September-to-November TV budgets on network television.

Network political advertising is harder to track than local television advertising. Whereas local TV stations freely share political buys on their stations, network salespeople have a culture of keeping their advertising clients’ spending highly confidential. With the September World Series approaching, Jester got a tip that Angle had bought network spots for Trump, and he began buying network World Series spots for Clinton. Soon, Angle and Jester learned another advantage of buying network. “The network lawyers take the LUR [lowest unit rate] seriously,” says Angle. The network lawyers decided they had charged Trump and Clinton too much for the World Series spots and promised refund checks to both campaigns. The checks arrived only after the election was over.

# Today’s Media Mix: More than TV

Although television continues to capture the largest share of advertising budgets, most campaign managers agree that it should be part of a larger portfolio of media used by the campaign to communicate with voters. Traditional broadcast TV has been losing its share of voter audience as we show in Chapter 9]] (see Figure 9.2]], page 197). Voters spend time with many media, including traditional media such as newspapers and radio and the newer media of the Internet and social networking. Any successful campaign manager will develop a “media mix” that cost-effectively reaches the campaign’s target voter audience across media platforms and leverages each medium to its particular strengths, such as the Internet for ads with a fundraising component or radio for GOTV pushes.

Veteran Republican operative and sometime Trump adviser Roger Stone argues that, in our fragmented media world, campaigns have a harder time reaching voters with their messages and that the media mix question has become a more complicated calculation than in earlier campaigns.

> There’s so much competition in the marketplace in terms of information. There’s information overload. There’s 100 cable channels, there’s digital TV, there’s your tablets, your Netflix type sites, your Twitter, your Facebook. I mean, we’re bombarded now with information from everywhere. There’s a magazine [and a website] for every discipline you can think of. You want a magazine for biking? There’s a biker’s magazine. You want a motorcycle magazine? There’s a motorcycle magazine. If you’re into fly-fishing, there’s a fly-fishing magazine. Knitting, there’s a knitting magazine. So, I mean, it’s a lot harder to reach people because they have all this information at their fingertips, and therefore everything takes greater repetition, far greater than it used to, say, when television was in its infancy. I remember in the days when I worked with Roger Ailes [who made Republican political ads before going to Fox News] on some campaigns, and we would buy 500, 600 points of television in New York, and we thought we were big shit.27

Someday, digital may rule. In fact, the 2016 presidential election was the first where the manager of a candidate’s television advertising came from a digital background. Brad Parscale’s then-small, Texas-based digital agency started working for the Trump organization in 2011. When he decided to run for president, Trump turned to Pascale to build and manage his website and run online fundraising and advertising. In the general election, Parscale’s portfolio was expanded to include television advertising. Perhaps because of Parscale’s digital roots, Trump spent as much as 50 percent of his budget on digital whereas Clinton’s digital share was closer to 30 percent.28 (For more on Brad Parscale see Appendix A]].)

Box 7.2 Where Political Digital Ad Dollars Go

**Facebook:** With its large reach among voters of all ages and advanced targeting options, Facebook has become the go-to political advertising platform. Political advertising has been a growing income stream for Facebook, which offered Clinton and Trump embedded Facebook staffers to work in their campaign offices. Only Trump accepted. Facebook’s advertising platform is relatively simple, giving all advertisers the ability to target ads down to a specific audience (e.g., men ages twenty-five to thirty-five, who are fans of Obama, who drive trucks, and have two kids at home). Facebook offers several ways of buying ads, including their reach and frequency tool, or standard bidding. The CPMs are efficient when compared to premium video networks.

**Programmatic:** Programmatic media buying is the algorithmic purchase and sale of digital advertising space in real time. The campaign sets parameters for voter targets—including geofencing that specifies the political district—a budget, and how much it is willing to pay per impression. Computers then take over and run the buying, placement, and optimization of digital ad space via an automated bidding system. These systems are called DSPs (demand side platforms) and are widely used as a supplement to direct buying. The most widely used DSPs are DBM, Adobe, Rocket Fuel, and Media Math. CPMs can range widely depending on ad units, locations, and targeting restrictions. For display, a CPM might range from three to fourteen dollars, and for preroll, it could range from thirteen to twenty-five dollars. Many political buys use DSPs to data-match the campaign’s e-mail list so they are more likely to saturate ads to their supporters. Many people categorize ad networks into the programmatic portion of the ad buy. Ad networks are collections of sites that have previously negotiated inventory rates and are sold as a bundle by vendors like Undertone and Yume.

**Over-the-Top Television:** OTT is how people, most of them younger, watch long-form video entertainment over the Internet or their mobile carrier instead of using cable, satellite, or broadcast TV channels. Hulu is a political ad leader in this category. Other providers are gaining popularity, including SpotX, Samba TV, NCC, Roku, and Xbox. Because Hulu is the most popular provider for OTT ads, inventory is often scarce, causing buyers to purchase well in advance. A typical OTT CPM might range from twenty-five to forty-five dollars, depending on location and target. Many news outlets such as NBC, CNN, and Fox News have VOD (video on demand) and OTT offerings as well. Most OTT providers have 90 percent to 98 percent completion rates, the highest in the industry.

**Streaming Audio:** Pandora and Spotify are popular among political advertisers. Pandora has some of the most granular targeting available in the streaming audio space. Not only can it complete a data match, but Pandora has its own proprietary data to enhance targeting. Most Pandora and Spotify spots are forced view (cannot be skipped) and are engaging. Streaming audio is available on multiple platforms, including OTT, tablets, desktop, mobile, and car radios. They have high completion rates, similar to that of OTT. Also similar to OTT, streaming audio is considered a destination location.

**Direct to Publisher:** These are video and display ads placed with individual websites, such as a local television station or newspaper. Ads can also be placed on national websites with zip code parameters to target impressions into a political district. These impressions are brand safe and have a lower fraud rate than that of programmatic advertising. When buying direct, display ads might cost ten to twenty-five dollars, and preroll ranges from twenty to forty dollars. You can control the placement on the page and guarantee delivery on a quality environment. Many publishers offer unique ad types that are more eye-catching and engaging than standard ads.

**Niche Social Media:** There is a lot of buzz about the political use of social media like Twitter or Instagram by politicians that falls in the “free media” category. But these sites attract less paid political advertising such as “promoted tweets.” Paid Twitter ads are used less frequently than Facebook ads due to Twitter’s smaller user base, bots, lack of comment control, and less specific targeting. Twitter is used mainly to talk to the chattering class and not average voters. Twitter offers multiple ways to purchase media: cost per engagement, cost per follow, website clicks, video views, and awareness.

**Search Advertising:** Campaigns usually have a healthy budget for search advertising partners such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Search advertising allows candidates to control which websites potential voters see at the top of the page. A buyer only pays when people click and visit the website. Like many other types of digital media, it is advertising in a lean-forward environment, where people are already engaged with the issue or candidate. Typical CPCs (cost per clicks) would be one to three dollars.29

In this rapidly shifting media climate, it’s hard for campaign managers to predict what the future of political advertising holds. Whether the dollars spent on broadcast television will shift substantially toward digital and so-called over-the-top TV platforms remains an open question. But thirty-second broadcast television ads will likely continue to be a key element in any effort to communicate with voters and build a winning coalition. Even in the age of digital politics, traditional television is still, and will probably remain, number one. However, the dollars spent on political digital are growing. In the next chapter, we start out by looking at how a campaign can make digital work for them and spend virtually nothing.

# 8 Producer and Stage Manager Creating and Presenting the Campaign’s Messages

**O**ne of the largest stages in American politics is the Iowa caucuses where late on the night of February 1, 2016, a dramatic cliffhanger was playing out, starring Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and upstart challenger Bernie Sanders. As the last results trickled in, Sanders trailed by less than 1 percent and had a shot at a major upset. “Holy shit, we could actually squeak out a win,” remembers Keegan Goudiss, who was running the Sanders digital campaign with his partner Scott Goodstein.

Bernie Sanders would not be giving any more speeches or making any more news in Iowa that night. He was still in Des Moines, but the senator was sitting in his chartered jet full of staff and reporters as it idled on the tarmac. A major snowstorm was coming. Sanders had a full day of campaigning scheduled the next day in New Hampshire where a must-win primary would take place in just eight days. Sanders wanted to get in the air, but there was a problem.

“The plane didn’t have Wi-Fi,” explains Goudiss. Once they left the ground, Sanders could not know the final results and would not be able to issue a news statement declaring victory or conceding a better-than-expected loss. Reporters traveling with Sanders would not be able to file stories. And, perhaps most importantly, campaign manager Jeff Weaver would lose communication with his war room at the Des Moines Airport Holiday Inn where Goudiss, Goodstein, and their digital team were waiting to craft the right message to spread to Sanders supporters and donors across the country. Phone calls and text messages bounced back and forth between the Sanders plane and the war room until, final results still unknown, the chartered Boeing 737 without Wi-Fi was forced to head to New Hampshire, two hours behind schedule.1

Earlier that evening, Sanders had appeared before a room of cheering Iowa supporters and enthusiastically declared, “While the results are still not known, it looks like we are in a virtual tie!” Says Goudiss, “We had a ‘win’ e-mail and ads ready to go, a ‘lose’ e-mail and ads ready. But we didn’t have a ‘tie’ e-mail or ad ready and we were basically tied in Iowa.” Out of touch with the Sanders mothership, the war room digital team watched the latest results. Goudiss and Goodstein watched activity on the Sanders servers that took small online donations, the lifeblood of their campaign. Sanders’s Iowa staffers were disappointed when it became clear that they would lose by a faction of a percent. However, the digital team was seeing that Bernie supporters around the country were fired up. “His base was really excited about the results. We could already tell, just from ambient [unsolicited] online contributions coming in that people were going to respond well to whatever we put out,” said Scott Goodstein. The narrow Iowa loss was shaping up to be an online fundraising win for Sanders.2

“A Virtual Tie!” said Senator Bernie Sanders to a cheering room of supporters as incomplete Iowa caucus results surprisingly showed underdog Sanders trailing favored Hillary Clinton by a fraction of a percent. An approaching snowstorm forced the Sanders campaign plane to depart for New Hampshire before the final tally was announced showing Clinton with 49.9 percent and twenty-three delegates and Sanders with 49.6 percent and twenty-one delegates. Polls taken three months earlier had shown Sanders trailing Clinton by 30 points in Iowa.

# Producing a 4:00 a.m. Media Event

It was around midnight in Iowa. The Sanders digital team was at work in the Des Moines war room as their candidate flew to New Hampshire. “I can’t remember who it was, but someone said, ‘Why don’t we have a rally when they get to New Hampshire?’” recalls Goudiss, who at first was skeptical of the idea. “How are we going to get them there because they are not going to land until four or five in the morning?” he remembers asking and then hearing, “We can text them. It’s late, but these people are still up watching.”

The Sanders campaign had successfully been encouraging supporters to opt in to their text messaging program, giving permission for the campaign to communicate with them via texts to their cell phones. “You collect the zip code as part of that. We looked and saw that there are a couple of thousand people who live around the airport who are passionate Bernie supporters and might come out to a rally at four or five in the morning,” says Goudiss. They got in touch with their New Hampshire director, who quickly began organizing an event at Bow Hampton Inn where the Sanders entourage would be staying. An event landing page was added to Sanders’s website and the invitations went out by text. Sanders supporters’ cell phones in New Hampshire began dinging. Some e-mails were also sent, Goodstein says, “but when the supporter reads that e-mail it’s going to be at seven or ten in the morning and the event would be over.” The ding of texts was crucial to getting attention and getting a crowd.

![[53.jpeg]]

**Early Morning Invitation.** In the wee hours of February 2, 2016, text messages were sent to Sanders supporters within a twenty-five-mile radius of the Manchester, New Hampshire, airport. An event landing page on the Sanders website gave details of a rally for the late-arriving Sanders after his near upset of Clinton in the Iowa caucuses.

**A post-Iowa predawn New Hampshire welcome for Bernie Sanders.** Responding to geotargeted text messages delivered to their cell phones, several hundred New Hampshire Sanders supporters turned out at 4:00 a.m. to greet their candidate on February 2, 2016. Even though he had narrowly lost to Clinton in Iowa the night before, the Sanders arrival rally made him look like the winner.

The campaign was hoping it might get fifty people to show up. Instead, several hundred cheering and sign-waving Sanders supporters turned out, creating a compelling visual for news photographers and videographers. Even though Sanders had narrowly lost to Clinton the night before, the text message–generated event enabled Bernie to arrive in New Hampshire looking like a winner, giving the Sanders campaign a momentum-building head start in the day-after-Iowa news cycle. CNN.com reported Sanders saying, “We’re going to fight really hard in New Hampshire and then we’re going to Nevada, to South Carolina, we’re doing well around the country.”3 It was also good for the morale of the candidate and his staff. “You’re exhausted, pulling up into a cold airport in New Hampshire in February, and, all of a sudden, there are all these people cheering. I think it was a welcome sight,” said Goudiss.

Campaigns are improvised theater. The impromptu Sanders rally on the morning of February 2, 2016, was produced and directed by the candidate’s digital team and made possible by their opt-in text messaging program. Candidate events have always been a vital communications tool for campaigns that are always looking for new technologies to make the most of their candidate’s limited time. Campaigning for Louisiana governor in the 1930s, Huey Long invested in sound trucks with loudspeakers that would run ahead of the traveling candidate to build crowds in rural communities. As a 1948 US Senate candidate in Texas, Congressman Lyndon Johnson became the first politician to fly by helicopter, using a bullhorn to draw small-town residents who came to see the new-fangled machine and then stayed for Johnson’s speech. When Sanders flew to New Hampshire in 2016, his bullhorn was a network of cell phones built by Goodstein and Goudiss and the Sanders digital operation.

Digital media consultants like Scott Goodstein and Keegan Goudiss are just beginning to rival the traditional preeminence of the political TV ad maker. (See Appendix A]], The Rise of the Campaign Webheads, for deeper background on Goodstein, Goudiss, and Trump’s digital media manager Brad Parscale.) Much more so than any other type of political professional, media consultants are likely to be the subject of news coverage—after Trump won, Parscale was interviewed on CBS’s _60 Minutes_.4 Media consultants have become political celebrities themselves, and some have developed reputations (and occasionally egos) comparable to those of their candidate clients. Campaign managers—who are often younger and less experienced than the media consultant—can sometimes find themselves mediating between the opinions of their media consultants, who are juggling multiple clients and operating outside the campaign, and the opinions of those inside the campaign, including the candidate and his closest advisers.

This was the situation facing a campaign manager we’ll call Chet who was running a Democratic gubernatorial campaign in Pennsylvania. With less than a week to go until election day, the campaign’s media consultant and pollster were arguing that the campaign should run a new and sharply negative television ad about the Republican candidate’s background. Chet agreed on the need for a hard-hitting spot, but the candidate wanted to avoid anything that could potentially backfire. Chet would have to work with the advertising consultant, the candidate, and even the candidate’s family to reach a decision.

# The Making of “The Guru” Spot

It was just days before the 1986 election, and Chet really needed a win. A few years prior, he’d quit his job as a lawyer to pursue his passion for politics with a new career as a Democratic campaign manager, but so far all he had to show were two losses. Despite these losses, Chet was developing a reputation within national Democratic circles as a competent, hard-charging, and colorful campaign manager. Earlier in the year, Chet had been given his third chance to win when he took over the long-shot Pennsylvania gubernatorial campaign of Bob Casey. Chet knew his third chance at winning could be his last.

Like his campaign manager, Casey also desperately needed a win—he’d already run for governor three times and failed. Media consultant Bob Shrum, who was an early hire for Casey, had introduced Chet to Casey during the Democratic primary campaign in hopes that Casey would replace his existing campaign manager (whom Shrum thought was “out of his depth”).5 According to Shrum, the straitlaced northerner Casey immediately hit it off with the foul-mouthed southerner Chet. Despite Chet not knowing anything about Pennsylvania politics, Casey hired him as his new campaign manager. Under Chet’s guidance, the Casey campaign won the Democratic primary by 16 points.

But Casey was still the underdog in the general election, where he faced the state’s young, attractive lieutenant governor, Republican Bill Scranton III. Twenty years earlier, Scranton’s father had been a popular moderate Republican governor of Pennsylvania and had unsuccessfully bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1964 against conservative Barry Goldwater. The younger Scranton III was more freewheeling than his father and had been a youthful practitioner of transcendental meditation. Despite his mustache and an admission that he had used illegal drugs in college, the Republican Scranton still managed to become Pennsylvania’s youngest-ever lieutenant governor in 1978. Here’s how Shrum remembers the 1986 matchup for governor:

> Our opponent, Lieutenant Governor Bill Scranton, was the thirty-nine-year-old son of a former governor, a Yale graduate, and a self-confessed 1960s “hippie.” Casey’s hometown was named for the Scrantons; they’d been the bosses living on the hilltop, while Irish immigrants like the Caseys lived in the valley and worked in the utilities and the railroad equipment factories owned by the Scrantons. Casey had a visceral sense that a Scranton victory would be unfair: he hadn’t done anything to earn it; he was being handed the governorship just because of who he was and what he’d inherited. But Bill Scranton was moderate and pro-choice, exactly the kind of Republican Pennsylvanians tended to elect.6

After years of writing speeches for Democratic notables like George McGovern and Ted Kennedy, Shrum had entered the political ad-making business just one year before the Casey-Scranton contest when he and his partners scored a win in the Virginia governor’s race. Now, in 1986, business for their new firm was good; in addition to Casey, Shrum’s firm was handling the TV advertising in Senate races in Maryland and California.

In Pennsylvania, Shrum’s new firm was facing the established and respected partnership of media consultants Doug Bailey and John Deardourff, who had a successful track record of electing mainstream Republicans like Bill Scranton. Although Shrum was developing a reputation for the deft use of negative TV ads, Bailey and Deardourff shared a reluctance to go negative.7 Two weeks before the election, Scranton announced that he was taking all his negative ads off the air, a move that earned him favorable press coverage and boosted him to an 8-point lead over Casey in tracking surveys taken by Casey’s pollster Pat Caddell, who had worked for Jimmy Carter’s successful 1976 campaign and in Carter’s 1980 loss to Ronald Reagan.

Behind in the polls with election day fast approaching, Chet and the rest of the Casey team had been put on the defensive by Scranton’s pledge to forego any attacks on Casey. The reason for Scranton’s move, according to Shrum, was to force Casey to take his anti-Scranton ads off the air. The negative ads had been working, damaging Scranton’s image and helping Casey erase most of Scranton’s early lead, said Shrum:

> We tied Scranton’s thin record to his privileged background. After college, the ad said, his family bought him a chain of small-town newspapers—and the photo of a long-haired Scranton filled the screen—“but he stopped going to work and the newspapers failed.” Then as lieutenant governor, he’d missed meeting after meeting of the state commissions he was on—one of his only real duties in that office. The spot concluded with, “They gave him the job because of his father’s name; the least he could do was show up for work.”8

Chet and Shrum needed to unleash a new attack ad on Scranton but were worried by a possible backlash from the state’s news media. How do we reach them? What do we tell them? These questions were uppermost in the minds of Casey’s campaign aides. Some people close to Casey were advocating that the campaign produce an ad to remind people of Scranton’s 1978 admission of past illegal substance use, an issue that had remained largely dormant in 1986. Such a spot might pull conservative Democrats and rural voters back into the Casey camp. But Casey himself had publicly promised not to do so. Chet’s hands were tied, particularly in light of Scranton’s recent no-negative ads pledge.

Suddenly, on a Saturday afternoon nine days before the election, Chet got the break he needed. A field staffer called to report he had a copy of a mailing from the Republican Party of Pennsylvania that attacked Casey. The mailing had been in the pipeline before Scranton made his pledge not to attack Casey. But details like that weren’t a problem for Chet, who immediately had a copy of the mailer hand-delivered to a leading political reporter at the _Philadelphia Inquirer_. The story ran the next day, a Sunday. Chet and the Casey campaign could claim that Scranton had broken his no-negatives pledge and that Casey would be justified in launching another attack of his own. Shrum recalled how they crafted the ad, which later became known as “the guru” spot:

> We had to claw our way back with one last “nuclear” attack on Scranton. We had discussed and rejected the option of an ad about his past drug use. I hated the idea. It was too risky. Instead, Caddell [the pollster] and I scripted an ad that skirted the line but didn’t go over it—except visually. Scranton had been a devotee of TM (transcendental meditation) and had traveled the world with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. TM might be harmless, but it didn’t sound that way to voters in the blue-collar precincts of mainstream Pennsylvania. With our editor Tony Peist, I was at Modern Video adding in Ravi Shankar-like sitar music to accompany the side-by-side pictures of the long-haired Scranton and the long-haired Maharishi when [Chet] walked in the studio to look at the spot.9

Chet agreed it was too risky to bring up the marijuana issue so late in the campaign. He also wanted to make sure that the new spot was not too subtle to get the message out in the last few days of the campaign. So Chet went rogue. Without telling Shrum or candidate Casey, Chet leaked to a reporter—through a third party—a rumor that Shrum was producing a spot about Scranton’s past marijuana use. When the press clamored to know if the story was true, Chet said that he and Shrum had wanted to make the spot but that Casey was against it. Casey looked like the good actor, while Chet got fresh press coverage about the old story of Scranton’s supposed marijuana use in college. The spot hadn’t even aired yet, but Chet and Shrum were already generating free message impressions in the news media. Now all they needed to do was to convince Casey to put the guru spot on the air.

With Chet onboard, media consultant Shrum took the lead on selling the spot to Casey. Casey was on the campaign trail, and, in those pre-Internet and pre–cell phone days, there was no quick way to show the candidate the actual spot. In an interview with the authors, Shrum said he got Casey on the phone while he was in a Mexican restaurant about four blocks from the Philadelphia video studio where the spot was being edited. Like many campaign decisions about advertising, this one was taking place at the last possible moment. “It was the Wednesday or Thursday before the election, and we had to get the spot hand-delivered to TV stations Friday morning,” said Shrum.10 If the spot was not delivered by Friday, it would not air over the critical preelection weekend. Shrum remembered the conversation:

![[56.jpeg]]

**“The Guru” Spot.** The highly controversial 1986 TV spot was produced by Bob Shrum for Pennsylvania Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bob Casey. It used grainy still photos to tie the young, mustachioed Republican Bill Scranton to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, with whom Scranton had studied transcendental meditation. “The spot is mild by today’s standards,” Shrum said in an interview with the authors. See the spot at www.nytimes.com/video/weekinreview/1194817112035/the-guru-ad.html]].

Bob Casey for Governor, 1986

> Casey was skittish about it. He was on the road. There was no way to show him the finished ad. I described it to him. He fretted that it might seem like we were bringing up drugs. The script never mentioned drugs, I said. I didn’t say that the look of the spot could evoke the drug issue without mentioning it. To defend the ad’s relevance, I went on, we had included a Scranton quote that he wanted to bring transcendental meditation to state government.11

Despite Shrum’s prodding, Casey remained skittish. Casey told Shrum that his family was strongly opposed to running the spot, particularly his eight children who were now mostly young adults. At Casey’s instruction, Shrum called one of Casey’s daughters:

> She was worried sick that the spot would defeat her dad and destroy his reputation. As we talked, I realized that there were other Caseys on the call. I said bluntly that if we didn’t run the ad, her dad was going to lose. Was I sure the spot would work? one of the Caseys asked. No, but it was our best shot. Would I take responsibility for it? Yes, I said, knowing that if Casey lost, his “unscrupulous” consultants would be excoriated anyway.12

Shortly after his call with Casey’s children, Shrum got the word: The candidate had approved the spot. The final edits were made, and videotape copies of the spot were rushed to television stations on the Friday morning before the Tuesday election.

# James Carville’s First Win

Casey’s campaign manager—whom we’ve been calling Chet—was in fact Chester James Carville, the Louisiana “Raging Cajun” who went on to run Bill Clinton’s winning 1992 presidential campaign (to learn more about Carville’s career and the 1992 Clinton campaign, see Chapter 11]], Strategy Enforcer). Thanks to Carville’s and Shrum’s shrewd decisions, the closing days of the campaign were dominated by talk about Casey’s guru spot and by news stories about Scranton’s drug use. On Tuesday afternoon at Casey headquarters in Scranton, while Pennsylvania voters were going to polls, Carville got some bad news: The first early round of network exit polls showed Casey behind. Carville ordered that Casey field staff and supporters who were driving to Scranton for the election night party should be diverted to Philadelphia, a Casey stronghold, where they could knock on doors and boost turnout. Carville knew this would make little or no difference, but he had to do something.

The extra canvassing in Philadelphia turned out to be unnecessary, and Casey’s election night party in Scranton was a good one. Over the course of a couple of weeks, Casey had gone from being 8 points behind in his own polling to winning on election day by 2 points. Ten years later, after he had successfully managed Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, Carville wrote about how he felt that Pennsylvania election night in 1986:

> What I felt was not in any way the ecstasy of victory. It was just the sheer relief that I could go home for Christmas and not be embarrassed. I called my mother. “Mama we did it! We did it!” Governor of Pennsylvania, that was big. It dawned on me that I wasn’t always going to be a failure.13

Carville says Casey was successful because his campaign’s messaging revolved around a consistent central theme:

> To me, the campaign turned into this heroic struggle between the son of a coal miner and the son of a coal mine owner, between people who were tenacious and resilient and those who had everything given to them. Holy Cross [Casey] versus Yale [Scranton]. This was a race of significance. Everything got viewed through that filter, and anything that didn’t fit I just defined as information that the elites and the privileged class were trying to force-feed the populace.14

Shrum told us that the guru spot was successful because, on the eve of the election, it reinforced the campaign’s central message as just described by Carville. After the campaign was over, according to Shrum, Governor Casey developed a lifelong aversion to hearing or talking about the guru spot: “[He] especially resented statements like one in _Wikipedia_ that it ‘depicted Scranton as a dope-smoking hippie.’ It didn’t, but that was a technical truth.”15

Did the guru spot make a difference between losing and winning? “I believe the spot made a difference. In a race that close, everything makes a difference,” answered Shrum. Years later, John Deardourff, Scranton’s media consultant, recalled that the guru spot represented a watershed for campaign manager James Carville as well. “In a way,” Deardourff said, “it launched Carville on the idea that this negative stuff worked. It continues to work.”

# What Do We Tell Voters?

Campaign managers must build a messaging portfolio that includes both positive and negative content. They must also anticipate their opponent’s messaging. In 2002, Graham Shafer, who ran Republican Van Hilleary’s campaign for Tennessee governor, developed a “message grid” that consisted of some basic questions. The questions sum up how most campaigns approach decisions about messaging. The questions included the following: “What’s your candidate going to say about themselves? What’s your candidate going to say about the opponent? What’s the opponent going to say about your candidate? And what is the opponent going to say about the opponent?” During the campaign itself, when Shafer and his team ran negative ads, they were sure to check what their ads were saying against the themes featured in their message grid. They had to be sure that they were sticking to their core arguments and issues.16

“Where do we meet that intersection of what we say about ourselves and what we’re going to say about the opponent?” he and his colleagues asked themselves. “And what they’re going to say about themselves?” Shafer’s team also returned to glance at the message grid whenever their opponents launched attacks against Hillary. “I’m a big fan of the counterpunch when it comes to negative advertising,” Shafer assured us. He argued that “a lot of times that counterpunch can be much more effective than the initial punch.” But the punches thrown—the war about the campaigns’ messages—were largely conditioned and driven by the message grid that Shafer and his team had initially developed.17 The typical campaign message grid or box looks something like Table 8.1]].

There is no magic formula that managers have when crafting an effective message grid. In fact, almost every campaign starts out with a blank message board. Rarely, campaign managers told us, do they have preordained messages they have successfully hammered out before the campaign is even launched. The general political environment in a particular year and a particular state or district sets the context, and the campaign manager must work with his or her team and the candidate to figure out what they are going to tell the voters—what they will say about themselves and what they will say about their opponents.

Table 8.1 ![[57.jpeg]]

As our campaign flowchart showed you (see Chapter 1]]), all campaigns have to answer some variation of the five core questions—(1) Who are our target voters? (2) How do we reach them? (3) What do we tell them? (4) How are we doing? (5) What are they doing? Once campaign managers have done the math and figured out what voters they need and how their campaign is going to reach the targeted voters, they need to figure out what goes inside the campaign’s communications box. What, in other words, are they going to tell the people?

The campaign message is really the stuff in the message box—what the campaign says about the candidate and what the campaign tells voters about their opponent. The box is supposed to offer campaigns a consistent message and a rubric that instills “message discipline.” Still, all messages must be at least a bit fluid too, in response to how their side is faring in the race and what the opposition is saying and how it is performing.

It’s also true that microtargeting—which has recently become a prized tool of most campaigns—makes little sense if there is no relevant message reaching targeted voters. The message box can be and often is multidimensional. It is both the box writ large for the entire campaign and the box that features the messages targeted to specific groups the campaign is trying to mobilize and sway. Let’s say a Democratic campaign manager is trying to peel off a handful of Republican voters. Well, she needs to figure out what the campaign is going to say to persuade these skeptical voters to support her side. Now let’s say a Republican campaign manager is attempting to increase turnout among her side’s partisans. She needs to figure out which messages will be the most effective way of boosting turnout.

In Chapter 2]], we showed you that campaigns can get to 50 plus 1 by some combination of turning out their own partisan supporters, persuading fence-sitters to vote for their side, depressing the other side’s turnout, peeling off some of their supporters, or expanding the size of the electorate in ways that favor them. Thus, the messages can be calibrated according to which of these five strategies the campaign is using. Put differently, campaigns figure out what they will tell voters after assessing the five options for achieving victory that are available to them. Campaign managers understand that messaging, like campaigns overall, is fluid and that they must also continually ask, “How are we doing?” and “What are they doing?”—and if necessary readjust their messages and strategies based on the answers to these core questions.

Still, it would be a mistake if students finished this chapter thinking that the message is totally malleable. It is not. Most campaign managers don’t want a message that drastically shifts depending on who’s being targeted or what’s happening in the world. According to the campaign managers we surveyed, campaigns lacking a consistent message are often losing campaigns—witness Hillary Clinton’s shifting messages in 2016 versus Trump’s consistent “Make America Great Again” message.

Campaigns, as Michael Bloomberg’s 2005 campaign manager Kevin Sheekey told us, need a “story arc.” And on that race, he “started developing themes early.” Sheekey had “to figure out who our electorate was and how we were going to target them and how we were going to move them.” Sheekey and his team went so far as to design attack ads themselves to simulate what they thought their opponents would throw at them—so they could anticipate the most effective responses.18 As we noted previously, campaign managers prize message discipline—with good reason. If they can force voters and the media to focus on the issues that most advantage their side, they then increase their odds of influencing elections on the margins—and it’s the marginal variance that often determines who loses and wins the election.

Some political professionals (including the authors) are wary of consultants who use a simplistic “box” to demonstrate how they are going to win the election. As a rule, it’s smart to beware of consultants wielding boxes—and we try to spare you the use of many boxes in this book. That said, the message box is a case of a box that actually makes some strategic sense, and it is often effective. Above all, though, a message box is used by many campaigns as they determine what they are going to tell voters—and attempt to stay “on message” during the ups and downs of the contest.

As Shafer argued, a message grid can help the campaign stick to the issues that resonate with voters and on which they perform well. Further, a grid can enable campaigns to anticipate what their opponent will be saying regarding those same issues—and how to respond swiftly and forcefully.

Once an effective message box is set and the themes are in place, a campaign can then combine that message box with its various demographic and political targets. This will help a campaign make sure it is right on the issues that are most important to the people in the areas where it counts the most.

Let’s keep in mind that determining the message is a dynamic process. In most campaigns, each side must decide for itself what the campaign is going to be about. Often, they agree on the focus of the message war. During George W. Bush’s 2004 election contest, for example, both the Kerry and Bush campaigns concluded that the campaign was going to be about Kerry, the challenger, rather than the incumbent, Bush.19 This seemed like an odd conclusion at first blush, but it actually made perfect sense. In 2004, President George W. Bush had approval ratings that were virtually impossible to move. He was well known and admired by many Republicans and disliked by many Democrats. At the same time, Kerry, despite being a long-serving senator, was still relatively unknown to the American electorate.

The Bush team set out to define Kerry for the voters before Kerry could define himself. Their goal was to portray Kerry as a flip-flopping liberal who couldn’t be trusted in times of crisis. Thus, the two campaigns agreed that the message war wasn’t about Bush but about Kerry. Kerry pollster Mark Mellman explained that “Kerry was the variable. He was the thing that could be changed . . . and therefore, even though the election is not primarily about John Kerry, what gets communicated in the campaign is primarily about John Kerry because that’s the one place where there’s room for change.”20

The 2004 ad-tracking data demonstrate how the negative messaging was focused much more on Kerry’s statements and qualifications than on Bush’s. Only 2.4 percent of Kerry’s ads focused solely on George W. Bush, whereas 59.5 percent of Bush’s ads focused solely on John Kerry. The Kerry campaign spent 61.8 percent of its advertising talking about Kerry’s positives, whereas the Bush campaign spent only 26.9 percent of its advertising talking about their candidate’s positive characteristics.21

But did any of this back and forth even matter? Kerry lost to Bush by nearly 120,000 votes in Ohio, which, had it gone for Kerry, would have flipped the election. Bush’s campaign ran an ad showing Kerry windsurfing as a narrator highlighted Kerry’s inconsistencies on the Iraq War among other key issues. A third-party group, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, also questioned Kerry’s war credentials and his patriotism. These negative ads did not by themselves win the election for Bush. But in a tight contest, they probably mattered, raising enough doubts about Kerry that made it harder for him to gain separation from Bush. If Bush hadn’t defined Kerry first, could Kerry have won the election? We’ll never know, but it’s not unthinkable.

# How the Message Matters

Here, we need to ask if the message matters, and if it does matter, how does it matter? How do campaigns determine what they are going to tell voters? Is negative advertising effective? If so, how? When does it backfire? What do America’s campaign managers think?

As we discussed in Chapter 2]], some scholarly theory holds that political messages have little to no impact on campaigns and election results. Even much-discussed negative ads, scholars say, don’t really affect who wins and who loses elections. According to this theory, each campaign is so well armed that typically their ad barrage is equal in firepower and offsets the other side. Scholars argue that even if this were not true, folks tuned in to Rush Limbaugh or Rachel Maddow on MSNBC likely pay attention to those shows because of their strong partisan predispositions. And ads that reach fewer ideological voters rarely penetrate so much that they turn out unlikely voters and persuade voters to vote a particular way, other scholars have said.22

Meanwhile, pundits see in political ads and message moments a series of game changers that determine the election’s outcome. Popular culture, as well, is equally off base when films and TV shows depict political advertising wizards working under the cloak of night to manipulate the masses into voting for a candidate based on fundamental deceptions. Consider, for instance, Robert De Niro’s character in _Wag the Dog._ The famous actor portrays a message maven who orchestrates a fake war with Albania to distract attention from a president up for reelection after being caught in a sex scandal.

Neither the scholarly theories nor the popular image fully captures the true impact messages can, and do, have on the electorate during the closest races. If the margins matter, then messages matter. But they don’t always matter; don’t necessarily matter in the same way on every race; and have different effects, depending on the circumstances. Still, there is no better way to affect a campaign’s share and performance during a hard-fought election than to use smart messages targeted at the right voters, backed up by the right amount of resources, to help campaigns reach their vote goal of 50 percent plus 1. And, as we saw in Chapter 7]], paid television advertising remains the overwhelming focus of such efforts, although messages delivered on digital platforms and via social media are becoming more important all the time.

Candidate speeches, press releases, e-mails, tweets, and yard signs can all motivate people to donate money, volunteer, and vote. But it is the televised ads that come over broadcast (and cable, to a lesser extent) channels that traditionally have had the most significant effect on the all-important margins of the electorate. Messages communicated through televised ads enable candidates to define their opponents (as Bush did with Kerry), defend their own records, connect their biographies to voters’ lives, and articulate what they would do in office. But there is now a robust debate about the right mix of television and digital advertising campaigns should use on Facebook, Snapchat, and YouTube among other social media sites in order to reach their targeted voters. For example, in their winning 2016 campaign, the Trump forces spent an unprecedented 50 percent of their budget on digital advertising.

But what is a campaign message? Almost all campaigns come down to a debate in which one side is for change and the other is for the status quo—as Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign famously framed it, “hope and change” versus the status quo. James Carville told us that electoral politics has long been about this basic change versus more-of-the-same proposition. “The first guy that stood up in the town square in Athens said something to the effect that this election’s really a choice, you know, between somebody that wants to do this and I want to do that,” Carville explained. “And the campaign fifty years from now is going to be that.”23

A message is also part of an extended argument over which side is best suited to be entrusted with holding office and wielding power. One campaign manager we spoke to asserted that in order to win over “a persuadable voter . . . you need somebody that has argument and an agenda that will win them over,” and that means “having a . . . sound message, a good agenda, and a person at the top that people can believe in and trust.”24

Now, let’s turn to the matter of how campaign messages get developed. Contrary to impressions fostered by _House of Cards_ and other popular TV shows, messages are not created by a single Machiavellian campaign brain; rather, as campaign managers told us, mostly messages get developed through a series of conversations held between candidates, their families, campaign managers, pollsters, and media advisers. There is no formula that all campaign managers follow when they go about figuring out “what we tell them.” Still, as a rule of thumb, drafts of messages get tested in focus and dial groups and are refined through field experiments, with polls and Internet surveys, and opposition research and counteropposition research. Not all campaign messages have the same audience, either.

Some messages are particularly aimed at mobilizing one side’s partisans to show up and vote, whereas others target so-called swing voters who are unsure which candidate they support but are likely to show up and vote on election day. And a campaign’s message can be adjusted over time, depending on what opponents are doing and what third-party groups (mostly super PACs) are doing. Achieving message discipline while also retaining sufficient flexibility to adjust when needed is a key to many successful campaign operations.

# Why Campaigns “Go Negative”

And let’s recall that not all campaign messages are bleak and harsh; in fact, some are more inspirational (think _West Wing_, the TV series) than cynical (_House of Cards_). Some of the campaign managers we talked to argued that a forward-looking message—defining their own brand, their own agenda, what they would do in office—was as important as “going negative” on the opposition. Campaigns that lacked what former president George H. W. Bush called “the vision thing” typically deprive themselves of a positive rationale for winning the job. Franklin Roosevelt’s 1932 pledge to enact a “New Deal” was a potent catchall that rallied Americans fearful during a great economic collapse. Ronald Reagan’s 1980 reminder of America as “a shining city on a hill” evoked national greatness and called for a return to prosperity. Trump, for all his controversial campaign statements and bluster, vowed that he would “make America great again.”

But, if close campaigns must make the race about choices, then they must almost always go negative at some stage of the race in order to underscore differences and gain separation from opponents. And let’s not forget that all negative ads are not alike. They have distinct tone, themes, and emphases. Some negative messages are contrast spots that highlight the differences between the candidates on particular issues (contrast ads), whereas other negative ads are efforts to eviscerate the opponent’s character, making her unelectable. Although some Americans believe that campaigns have become harsher, more personal in recent years, since the nation’s founding, campaigns have been focused on gaining separation from one’s opponent to affect the vote total at the margins. Rick Ridder, who managed Colorado Democrat Diana Degette’s congressional races, told us the following:

> If I got it right, within the first few chapters of the Bible, God goes pretty negative on Adam and Eve. I think it’s how you go negative. You have to make sure that it’s accurate and you have to make sure that you detail precisely what it is. You know, when they uncovered Pompeii, they found on a wall that had been covered in rubble for a thousand years the words, “Crassus is a crook.” Crassus had turned out to be a local mayor. And as early as that time, you know, 100 AD or whatever, they were going negative on their politicians.25

Indeed, the early Republic was replete with examples of negative campaigning, making it something of a national pastime. In 1796, Federalist John Adams attacked Democrat Thomas Jefferson as an “atheist,” “anarchist,” “demagogue,” “coward,” and “trickster.” In 1800, Jefferson’s supporters started a rumor that John Adams, Jefferson’s presidential campaign opponent, intended to marry his son off to George III’s daughter and restore British rule to the Americas. Adams supporters then cast Jefferson as “the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father . . . raised wholly on hoe-cake made of coarse-ground southern corn, bacon and hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog.” (George W. Bush never accused John Kerry of eating “hoe-cake.”) In 1828, Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams ran against each other for president and ended up attacking each other’s wives; Jackson’s supporters claimed that Louisa Adams was an illegitimate child who had been having sex with Adams before marriage. Adams supporters charged that Rachel Jackson married Jackson before her previous marriage had legally ended.26 In 1884, Republican James Blaine suffered attacks when he refused to distance himself from a Protestant minister’s anti-Catholic slurs, including that the Democrats were the party of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.”27 Grover Cleveland, his opponent, was assailed for having fathered an illegitimate child, leading to Blaine’s campaign slogan, “Ma, ma, where’s my pa?”28

But why do campaigns still use negative messages and advertising in particular? And how do such messages affect the election at the vote margins? Do these messages truly matter? How so? Campaign managers argued that simply by affixing the negative label to an ad, it is another way of saying, “any ad run by my opponent that I don’t like.” But calling a message “negative” reveals little about its taste, accuracy, or purpose. Some positive ads are wildly misleading, whereas some negative ads are calm, factual critiques of an opponent’s record.

Negative ads, campaign managers told us, serve several purposes. They often feature more truthful information than positive ads. They give voters information about the key differences among the campaigns and signal to voters that the stakes are high and the election is consequential. In 2008, Hillary Clinton ran the “3:00 a.m. phone call” ad that questioned Barack Obama’s experience in international politics.29 The message was deemed a “negative” ad—yet was it a disservice to the public to challenge the qualifications of the man who would later become the leader of the free world?30 Similarly, during the 2008 campaign between Obama and McCain, was it “negative” of Obama to question McCain’s apparent lack of interest in the economy?31

Most campaign managers agree that positive ads—although important—are often less impactful than negative spots. According to Vanderbilt political scientist John Geer, “If we only listen to the candidates’ positive advertising, we would believe we have a choice among these perfect candidates who are going to balance all budgets, solve all educational problems, and end the problem of global warming within four years.”32 Geer, who authored a book called _In Defense of Negativity_, added, “That’s a preposterous position. You need the other side of the coin. And the other side comes from these attack ads.”33 And most campaign managers agree with that.

Campaign managers are also acutely aware that much of the public has a love-hate relationship with negative televised advertising. But managers told us that these ads could be highly effective in focus groups and at least partly responsible for why they both lost and won particular races. Steven Law, who managed Mitch McConnell’s 1990 Kentucky Senate campaign, described how he and his campaign team cut a series of negative spots and tested them on focus groups. He was surprised when he learned how voters responded, “by giving a high believability score to our most negative ad, which was what we ended up putting on the air. The most negative ad had the most concrete information and that’s what [the voters] responded to. It was the hard information in the ad rather than the harsher tone.”34 One southern campaign manager said that negative ads were essential to informing voters about the choices they faced. “I would be perfectly happy if every voter out there would just take it upon themselves to go to the candidates’ websites, to read the articles about them, do their own research on it, and make up their own minds,” this manager told us. “But they’re not. I mean, we’re lucky if we get 50 percent of the electorate to actually turn out to vote, let alone how much smaller the person that actually takes the time to research their own candidates before they vote, as opposed to those who just vote straight ticket as to the ones you actually can affect with your own advertising. So, you know, you pull out every weapon in your arsenal [including] . . . running negative ads.”

# A “Hugging Contest”? Why Negative Ads Affect Election Margins

Managers further said that negative ads were often highly effective at contrasting their campaigns against their opponents’, gaining separation for their candidates in small and crucial ways on the electoral margins.

Casey Phillips, who managed Delbert Hosemann’s 2007 Mississippi Secretary of State campaign, spoke for other managers when he called negative advertising “a necessary evil.” “Every campaign that is behind has to use it to close the gap,” he told us. Phillips added that “there’s really no such thing” as going too negative. “In this country, I am convinced that people secretly love gossip and negative and nasty campaigns, but they just can’t admit it to themselves. Football games and boxing matches draw huge crowds and they are rough; how many people could you pack into a stadium for a hugging contest? The future of our country is at stake, don’t be afraid to figuratively punch your opponent in the face.”35

Again, it’s important to recall that not every negative message is the same. Based on our survey of campaign managers, there is no iron law about how campaigns are best able to use negative ads and messages. It really depends on the circumstances, as we showed you in the 2004 case of Bush and Kerry. What’s surprising is that numerous campaign managers reported to us that in their extensive experience, candidates were reluctant to “go negative” on their opponents. They had little affection for the jugular. Yet they also tended to relax their inhibitions once they came under attack from the other side.

Mike Hamilton ran Alabama Republican Martha Roby’s 2010 congressional campaign, and he revealed that Roby was opposed to running “harsh negative ads from the get-go. . . . Martha’s test was that, ‘I want to be able to go to the Publix grocery store with my kids after the elections and still be able to have a smile on and have people respect me.’” So, Hamilton says, the campaign never unleashed harshly negative spots, although he was able to persuade Roby to nationalize the race by running “a harder-hitting contrast ad” against her opponent Bobby Bright, a Democrat who had voted for Nancy Pelosi to be the House Speaker. “Very few [candidates] start off a race saying, ‘Hey, I want to go for the jugular,’” Hamilton concluded.36 Roby won 51 percent on election day, hitting her campaign’s goal of 50 percent plus 1. The ad helped Roby gain separation, nationalizing the contest and enabling her to unseat a Democratic incumbent in an anti-Democratic year.

Campaign manager Casey Phillips echoed Hamilton’s observation. “As a campaign manager, the hardest thing about negative advertising is getting your candidate to go along with it, because if you’re a journeyman like me, you can be out the door and on to the next state and the next race the day after the election,” Phillips told us. “The candidate and his or her family have to continue to exist in those communities and make a living win or lose. . . . It’s a game . . . with real-life consequences.”37

There is no formula for creating messages that affect the margins that often decide elections. Some ads that are expected to be effective ultimately fizzle, whereas others that might seem odd at first blush ultimately resonate. In 2010, Republican California Senate candidate Carly Fiorina ran what has since come to be known as the “demon sheep” ad against her primary opponent, Tom Campbell. To make the case that Campbell was a “fiscal conservative in name only (FCINO),” Fiorina’s ad featured an individual dressed as a sheep with glowing red eyes, crawling on all fours among other actual sheep. Although the ad puzzled political professionals, political newcomer Fiorina was able to defeat former congressman Campbell before losing in the general election to her opponent Senator Barbara Boxer, a longtime Democrat. Did the ad, which never actually aired on television, change the primary election outcome? Probably not. But trailing Campbell in the polls, Fiorina spent millions of her own fortune on ads that helped persuade Republican primary voters that she was authentically conservative. The demon sheep spot earned news coverage and shored up her credentials while calling Campbell’s into question.38

Other factors compel campaign managers to endorse and convince candidates to accept the fact that they must sooner or later in tight races “go negative.” For example, some campaigns deliberately make the election a “mudfest” right out of the gate to bait their opponents into getting into the mud with them. Some campaign managers believe that mudfests leave voters unhappy with both sides and lead to a low-turnout election that aids the incumbent; if fewer new voters turn out, there is less chance of a surprise.

In 2008, when Democrats swept to power across the country, Missouri Republican representative Sam Graves faced Democratic challenger Kay Barnes in what was expected to be a tough election fight. Yet Graves’s campaign was led by Jeff Roe, Graves’s former chief of staff who was no stranger to flinging mud. In 2006, Roe and Graves had charged that a sixty-three-year-old grandmother who was running against Graves was actually a pornographer on the theory that she had once sold advertising for the science magazine _Omni_, which at the time was owned by _Penthouse_.39 In 2008, Roe was again able to lure the opposition, this time Kay Barnes, into a negative slugfest.

Carly Fiorina produced a famous ad against primary opponent Tom Campbell that featured “demon sheep.”

The strategy was effective. Graves likened Barnes to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with ads denouncing the “San Francisco lifestyle” and one spot that accused Pelosi of “throwing a party for Kay Barnes.”40 Barnes, for her part, ran an ad that called Graves “pathetic.” Election day wasn’t even close. In a very good year for Democrats, the Republican, Graves, crushed Barnes, 59.4 percent to 36.9 percent.41 By going negative early and turning the campaign into a mudfight, Graves was able to tarnish both sides and do what he needed to do to hold on to his job. It may have been winning ugly, but the negative onslaught worked.

# When Going Negative Backfires

Just as no sure formula exists for going negative, sometimes negative messages also backfire. Mike Hamilton argued that “harsh” and “personal” attack ads were more politically dangerous to run than “issue-based,” “contrast” ads. “You can go over the line and it can backfire,” he told us.42 Other managers argued that if one candidate is ahead in the polls, running negative ads can have an adverse effect on the election results. Michael Sullivan, who ran Republican Patrick Hughes’s losing 2010 US Senate primary race, argued that going negative when a campaign led in the polls can boost the name ID of the opposition. Sullivan recalled working on a campaign where the campaign manager wanted to go negative, and Sullivan opposed doing so. Going negative, he argued, would raise the opponent’s name ID and remind voters that they had “another option.” Another lesson Sullivan has learned is that when campaigns turn negative, the campaign becomes a tussle over “who can seem the least dirty.” “You can win on good advertising and a good candidate,” he concluded.43

Negative ads are also held to a higher standard, and that’s a positive development overall in the world of campaigns, argued campaign manager Steven Law.44 Today’s press corps, Law reasoned, will not allow campaigns to “just run a spurious ad” and get away with it. Law hypothesized this about voters:

> [They have become] much more sophisticated consumers of political information than they used to [be] largely because of the Internet. . . . I think it’s harder to move people than it used to be because they have information sources that they’re shaped by that your advertising may impact or may not. . . . I think it’s much more of an art than it used to be when you could just run 1,000 points behind a negative ad and you could—as [the late Republican ad maker] Greg Stevens used to joke, “make it true.”45
> 
> He added that “the old . . . three negative points on a graph with an ugly picture of your opponent doesn’t work anymore.” Voters don’t necessarily know all of the facts, Law said, “but they have deeply ingrained perceptions that shape and condition how they view things.”46

Another check against unrestrained negativity is the voters themselves—if a candidate attacks in an overly personal manner, crosses an ethical line, or blatantly lies, their campaigns can be engulfed in negative attention, and they can suffer at the polls. One example of breaching such boundaries occurred in the 2010 California congressional race, when Republican state assemblyman Van Tran came up with a novel way to turn voters against his opponent, Senator Loretta Sanchez (D-CA). Tran sent out mailers with the words, “Open for a fragrance sample of ‘Loretta, the Scent of Washington’” printed on the outside.47 When the recipient opened the mail piece, they were assaulted with the smell of human feces, and “Something smells rotten about Loretta. It’s the stench of Washington.”48 (One GOP staffer told the _Atlantic Monthly_ “it is a horrible odor—like a combination of five or six of the worst possible scents you can imagine.”)49 When the mailer hit voters’ doors (and olfactory senses), they were aghast. Many complained that it even made their house smell foul while sitting in the trash. Tran ended up losing to Sanchez 51 percent to 42 percent in a district that used to be reliably Republican (although it is now 69 percent Hispanic, a mostly Democratic voting bloc).50 Had Tran’s mailer never existed, Sanchez still might have won the election, but the margin probably would have been tighter than 9 percent.

Negative advertising—this time by a third-party group—can also unintentionally do damage to candidates who have no control over the third-party messaging. Recall that the campaign manager plays many roles and that campaigns are seeking to answer five core questions to affect the election at the margins. But it’s equally important to note that much remains beyond any campaign’s control, and that’s become especially true with the rise of super PACs, which are essentially third-party groups funded by anonymous donors that engage in mobilization and persuasion activities (through television advertising) yet aren’t allowed to coordinate with the official campaigns.

One glaring instance of a third-party ad that backfired happened during a 2011 special election for a Los Angeles–area congressional district. In June, a group called Right Turn USA created a controversial web video charging that Democratic candidate Janice Hahn supported a program that allowed former gang members to receive time off prison sentences for mentoring current gang members.51

Yet the video, which some have labeled the most offensive campaign ad of all time, featured two black males shooting machine guns into the air while stuffing dollar bills into a stripper’s underwear. There is simulated oral sex, while the lyrics “give me your cash, bitch!” play over a hip-hop beat. Pictures of famous outlaws (including, for some reason, Charles Manson) pop up on the screen, insinuating that Hahn’s support of the mentoring program meant she favored sending taxpayer money to violent criminals.52

Naturally, the web video created a firestorm of controversy, generating nearly a half million views in its first week online. Hahn’s Republican challenger, Craig Huey, quickly denounced the ad and attempted to distance himself from it. But his comments had no impact. In a shrewd political move, Hahn actually tried to keep the web ad in the news, filing an official complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) tying Huey’s campaign to it.53

The web video’s producer, a controversial filmmaker named Ladd Ehlinger Jr., who on his website compares himself to filmmaker Orson Welles, complained that Huey was “missing an opportunity” by not embracing his message.54 The controversy undercut Huey’s image and helped sink his chances. On July 13, Hahn defeated Huey by a 55 percent to 45 percent margin. Third-party ads are clear cases where campaign managers lack control over what outside groups are doing. They serve as stark reminders that as much as campaign managers seek to influence share and performance, they sometimes have little control over the actions of third parties and events in a city, state, or country that nobody controls.

One northeastern campaign manager told us that negative ads backfiring were a growing problem, and he approached his campaigns by sticking to some advice he received when he was starting his career.

> The first person to ever tell me about messaging said, “Don’t ever lie in a negative attack because that’ll actually hurt you more than it hurts them.” And so I’ve never put anything out there that’s untruthful. I’ve never put anything out that’s completely slanderous or just making stuff up.55

# Going Negative in a Primary

How the message matters in a primary differs from how it matters in a general election. In a general election, going negative on an opponent is like checkers. One side attacks and hopes the opponent’s voters either switch to that side’s candidate, decide not to vote at all, or their partisans are even more motivated to vote. But going negative in a crowded primary is more like chess than checkers. If one candidate attacks another candidate, there’s no guarantee voters will switch over to the candidate responsible for the ad—they may have a number of other moves they can make. Furthermore, when a candidate attacks another candidate in a primary, it’s typically true that the person is attacking someone with many of the same policy positions that the attacker holds. The result is that both attacker and the object of the attack end up getting tarnished in the eyes of the primary electorate. And primaries tend to be such low-turnout affairs that the margins, at times, can matter even more than in some general elections. This fear of Republican-on-Republican fratricide partially explains why so many GOP presidential candidates were reluctant to launch negative barrages against front-runner Donald Trump during the 2016 GOP primary. They wanted Trump out of the race but feared that if they attacked they’d go down with him.

Katie Packer, who served as Mitt Romney’s deputy campaign manager in 2012, viewed Trump’s front-runner candidacy with growing concern; she thought Trump was not a true Republican and unfit for the presidency, and wanted him out of the race. Trump had a real shot at winning both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary, however. Back-to-back victories in those states would make him unstoppable, Packer figured. In an interview with the authors, Packer explained how she ran an anti-Trump super PAC that took on Trump in Iowa. With funding from the super-wealthy Ricketts family, Packer’s super PAC “did a full-court press. We were on television, we were in the mailboxes, we were on the phones, we were online. It was a fully three-dimensional campaign, with earned media support, for three straight weeks, in a state that’s pretty small.”

Their message, as she described it, “was one, Trump isn’t really a Republican, and two, he’s kind of an embarrassment.” Packer’s group drew on opposition research based on Trump’s past statements and ran waves of advertisements that “showed him being on both sides of virtually every issue that matters to Republicans.”

> We had lots and lots of video of him saying he was pro-life, saying he was pro-choice; saying he was for the Second Amendment, and saying he wanted to curb their rights; saying that we would repeal Obamacare, saying we need to have a national health care system paid for by the government. We had him, on video, virtually on every side of every issue. We also had him on both sides of immigration, which was his signature issue. He had kind of catapulted to the top on this notion of Mr. Tough Guy on immigration. We had him on video saying, “You can’t deport people that have lived here for a long time. You have to have a path to citizenship.” 56

Trump ultimately finished second in Iowa, about 4 percentage points behind Texas senator Ted Cruz. Packer, for one, thought the super PAC attacks on Trump generated enough questions about Trump’s Republican bona fides that he couldn’t prevail. But Packer’s group only had enough money for Iowa and couldn’t duplicate the feat in New Hampshire or anywhere else. “We just never really had the resources, early on, to be successful beyond Iowa. The next place that we were able to marshal significant resources was Florida, but it was too late.”57 Trump won the nomination, thanks partly to other candidates’ reticence about attacking him in the primary and the inability of any super PAC to sustain its anti-Trump campaign. The delicate challenge of launching negative messages amid a crowded primary field is one factor that explains how a real estate mogul distrusted by Republican elites could win the party’s nomination.

Chris Durlak, who ran Chuck Volpe’s 2010 state senate campaign in Pennsylvania, explained the problem of developing a message and engaging in contrast during a primary with multiple candidates running. For example, he said, “In a six-way primary, it’s hard to be aggressive. We wanted to be aggressive. We knew we needed to be aggressive, but the problem in a six-way primary is if you attack someone else, they don’t necessarily come to you. They have multiple other places to go.” He cited the 2004 Democratic presidential primary, arguing that Howard Dean was winning Iowa when he unleashed an attack on former House minority leader Dick Gephardt. Gephardt then turned around and attacked Dean. “They start fighting on TV. What happens? John Kerry and John Edwards one and two, Howard Dean three, distant three, Dick Gephardt four. It’s murder-suicide.”58

Thanks to Volpe’s own wealth, Durlak’s campaign had the most money and ultimately spent more than $600,000 on a single state senate seat in Pennsylvania. Durlak said the question hanging over Volpe’s race was this: When are you going to attack this guy? In the end, their strategy came up just short.

Volpe lost to a dark-horse candidate, John Blake, by fewer than 800 votes. The inability to launch an effective attack in a six-person primary was a blow to Volpe’s campaign, and Durlak’s story is a reminder that money matters and the message matters, but money by itself does not buy elections.59

# Responding to Negative Attacks

Finally, recalling the question “What are they doing?” campaigns must also figure out how they respond when they are hit with a negative attack. If a candidate is in a competitive race, chances are high the opponent will go negative eventually. And the closer the race is, the more the margins matter and the nastier the attacks may become as campaigns fight for every last vote. Campaign managers argued that the best defense against such attacks was to be prepared. One of the first tasks of any campaign was to research one’s own candidate and anticipate how the opposition is going to attack one’s side, they consistently stressed.

Some attacks, however, are so far out of the blue that they can’t be anticipated. One campaign manager who wished to remain anonymous described a particularly odd attack their candidate faced:

> It was a really hardcore attack. And I remember very vividly it actually accused—this is actually something I use as an example all the time in my work right now. It accused my candidate of using Chinese-bought pencils in his role at the Michigan lottery. Chinese pencils. I mean, they showed the pencils on the TV. Chinese pencils. You just can never forget that, right?
> 
> That was the first negative ad. There were three. And so, you know, I think that we all came together as a team and had to really decide, “What do we do?” Because you never want to react on their message. You want to always be on your message and communicate on your terms, right? So we didn’t want to change what we were talking about to go react to what they were talking about. And we needed to decide, well, do we make a decision to change what we’re talking about because we think that what they’re saying is going to so affect voters that we need to change what we’re talking about? And we made a decision that it didn’t. We made a decision that we were communicating with voters enough with a message that we didn’t need to change what we were talking about.60

If an opponent is spending money on advertising that doesn’t make a dent, campaign consultant Evan Tracey argued that campaigns are better off just ignoring the attacks. “Never interrupt your enemy when he’s making a mistake. Very good political advice. Too many people try and come in when someone else is self-destructing. Just resist the urge. Seriously, resist the urge and let them do it themselves.”61

When former member of Congress Charlie Melancon first ran for the US House, he was surprised by one attack he received. Melancon’s opponent, Republican Billy Tauzin III, began running an ad accusing Melancon of supporting sex education for third graders while a member of the state legislature.62 Melancon’s campaign manager, Brad Beychok, described how his campaign reacted to the sensational charge.

> The first instinct when you see an ad on TV that says he voted for sex education for third graders is, “Where’s the research?” Like you yell for your researcher to come in here and tell you why this is not true. Or if we didn’t see it was coming, well, how did we miss this? And it’s never a good conversation if they’re like, “I got to get back to you.” They’ll give you an answer within seconds. If they can’t give you an answer within seconds, you’re in deep shit.
> 
> Now see, we had this in 2004, they ran an ad against us, against Melancon, that said that he voted for sex education for third graders. The firm that did our self-research, it was not in our book. He voted in the state legislature on some goofy bill that somehow had some sort of money for third graders to have sex education. And that was something you’d like to have caught. I think you have to be prepared.63
> 
> —Bradley Beychok, campaign manager, Charlie Melancon for Senate, 2010 (LA)

In the course of researching one’s own candidate, campaign managers wanted to tie up any loose ends the research finds. Beychok explained that during another campaign he ran, the candidate had to quickly resolve some tax issues before their opponent made them an issue.

> So I’ll give you another example. I’ve done self-research on a candidate where we took—after we did our own research, we found out that our candidate had taken a homestead exemption in both Washington and the state that we worked in. And it was an honest mistake of a CPA not realizing that they took an exemption in both areas. But it was one that would come back and bite you in the ass.
> 
> So in that sense, speed is important because what do you do? You go back to the D.C. tax office, say, “Hey, I owe this much money according to my records and taxes, I made a mistake.” You clear it up, and then that issue is over, dealt with, and done.
> 
> If you let someone come to you and say, “We think you took two home exemptions, didn’t go pay it,” you say, “I took care of it,” you’ve gotten busted. And so it’s very important I think to do your own research on yourself and know what those attacks are going to be.64
> 
> —Bradley Beychock, campaign manager, Charlie Melancon for Senate, 2010 (LA)

If campaigns know a specific attack is coming, they then often try to break the news on their own terms. But they can’t always anticipate it in time and find themselves blindsided.

During the 2011 Republican presidential primary, for example, Texas governor Rick Perry called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme.” But Perry wasn’t prepared for any backlash. One of Perry’s opponents, Mitt Romney, shredded Perry for wanting to “eliminate” Social Security. Perry was made to look like he disliked the program and wanted to gut it. Perry faded quickly and never seriously challenged for the GOP nomination.

# “What Do We Tell Them?”

This is the core strategic question guiding the message development of every campaign. And most campaign managers explained that if done artfully and under the right circumstances, it was fair and responsible to run ads showing why the other side’s positions would do damage to their constituents. Campaigns, ultimately, are about choices—“change versus more of the same.” Campaign managers said they wanted to inform the voters with credible information so voters could make the best-informed choices, could know that the stakes were high, and that every vote mattered.

Campaigns have long been fueled by efforts to define the opposition. And although the means by which campaigns deliver their messages have evolved through the decades, the fundamental messages coming from campaigns have not changed much at all. The next chapter is also about “What do we tell them?” It explores how campaign managers use “earned media” to deliver their messages and how they navigate an increasingly complex media landscape that’s speedier, more fraught, and more exciting for campaign managers than it has ever been.

# 9 Spinmeister Navigating the News Landscape

_**B**oston Globe_ journalist Annie Linskey was suddenly professionally envious. It was an evening in May 2016 as the presidential primaries were winding down, and Linskey was among several political reporters who were swapping campaign stories while enjoying an after-deadline bite to eat at Washington’s Mayflower Hotel.

Across the street from the _Globe_’s bureau, the stately Mayflower has long been part of the Washington political scene. It was the hotel where former New York governor Franklin Roosevelt and his family stayed before Roosevelt’s first presidential inauguration in 1932. Another New York governor and frequent Mayflower guest, Eliot Spitzer, quickly became an ex-governor in 2008 after it was revealed that he often enjoyed staying at the Mayflower where he would rendezvous with paid female escorts.

The reason for Linskey’s journalistic envy was a phone call from Trump Tower. While at the Mayflower that evening having dinner with the small group of reporters, Linskey’s _Globe_ colleague Matt Viser had just heard from Hope Hicks, the long-serving Trump communications staffer. She was calling to say that Trump had approved Viser’s interview request. He could expect a call from Trump’s cell phone in as soon as five minutes, news that made Viser leave his food unfinished and scramble across Connecticut Avenue to the offices of the _Globe_’s Washington bureau.

# Spinmeister Turned Reporter

Linskey, who had been assigned to cover Hillary Clinton in March 2015, had been able to negotiate only a single one-on-one telephone interview with her candidate, and that was back in November 2015, nearly a year ago. Meanwhile Matt Viser, who covered Trump, seemed to have much less trouble getting his candidate on the phone, even at night. “Trump was known for publicly attacking the news media at his campaign rallies and on Twitter,” says Linskey, “but people don’t realize that he was actually very available to reporters, much more so than Clinton.”

As a student at Wellesley College, Annie Linskey interned for Massachusetts lawmakers. After graduating in 1997, Linskey soon found herself as a twenty-something press secretary for a succession of Democratic Congressmen in Washington. Good steady pay with benefits, but Linskey wanted to work in her home state of Connecticut. So, in 2002, she moved to Hartford to be campaign press secretary for Bill Curry, an underfunded Democratic challenger to popular incumbent Republican governor John Rowland who was running for his third term.

Several days before the election, Linskey was with Curry when he got into a “huge screaming argument” with a young female reporter from the _Hartford Courant_, the state’s largest newspaper. When the reporter started crying, Linskey intervened and suggested that Curry calm things down. Curry turned to Linskey and told her she was fired—perhaps the only time a campaign press secretary has been fired in the presence of a working reporter. Days later, Curry lost to Rowland by 12 points in heavily Democratic Connecticut.

But Curry’s loss turned out to be a career win for Linskey. Unemployed, she decided she’d rather be a reporter than a political spokesperson. “I was always jealous of reporters because they got to ask tough questions about things that the campaign was pussyfooting around,” says Linskey. Instead of writing press releases, she started writing freelance articles for her Connecticut hometown newspaper, the _Greenwich Time_. Returning to D.C., she was the paper’s Washington correspondent while she looked for a better-paying job at a bigger newspaper.

“I was very, very lucky,” says Linskey. A friend at the highly respected _Baltimore Sun_ told her about an opening in the book review section of the Sunday paper. “My friend just kept putting my resume on the top of the pile of applicants and they eventually hired me.” When the _Sun_ dropped the book review section a few months later, Linskey was reassigned as an entertainment reporter covering concerts, restaurants, and bars. “People would say ‘what a dream job’ but I wanted to do hard news,” says Linskey, who is not a big music fan. “So I would ask about health code violations when I was doing restaurant and bar reviews,” she recalls with a smile.

Linskey was then sent to the _Sun_’s bureau in Annapolis, the Maryland state capital on the Chesapeake Bay, where she was responsible for covering crime and, strangely, sailing. “The managing editor of the _Sun_ had a sense of humor and he wanted to be able to tell people he had a police reporter that also wrote a sailing column.” Linskey got lucky again. Her police and sailing beats converged when the wealthy publisher of the local Annapolis newspaper vanished from his yacht in the Chesapeake. “Was it suicide or murder? It was a great story to cover.”

Even though she switched from being a press secretary to a reporter, she encourages young people to try working in politics. Her advice: “Just try to find a candidate that you really believe in and connect with.”

Linskey moved back to the _Sun_’s downtown Baltimore newsroom where, after a stint covering the police and fire departments, she ended up doing political reporting on Baltimore’s mayor and Maryland’s governor. She loved writing for the _Sun_, but she thought the _Sun_ was stingy; after nine years, Linskey felt she would never make any more money than she was making, and her bosses complained about her expense reports.

But then Linskey got lucky once more when she was recruited away by deep-pocketed Bloomberg News, owned by the billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. There were no more complaints about expense reports. After covering Boston for a year, Linskey in 2014 was moved back to Washington where Bloomberg was beefing up its political staff. In the spring of 2015, the _Boston Globe_ came calling, asking Linskey to join the paper’s coverage of the 2016 presidential election. It was her dream job.

# Cautious Clinton versus Freewheeling Trump

Annie Linskey, Wellesley ’97, was soon assigned as the _Boston Globe_’s lead reporter covering the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, Wellesley ’69. The paper joined the Clinton “pool,” giving Linskey rare close contact with the candidate. The “pool” is a group of reporters from different news organizations who band together and electronically share their coverage.1

Box 9.1 What a Pool Report Looks Like

Linskey enjoyed her role as a Clinton reporter. But, like every reporter, she coveted a one-on-one exclusive interview. These were not easy to get with Hillary Clinton, who, according to Linskey, kept her distance from the journalists covering her. She recalls one 2015 incident:

> I went up to New Hampshire for one of her first events. Jennifer Palmieri [a Clinton communications staffer], who is fantastic, gently collected four or five reporters, all women, to have drinks at this cute little inn where Hillary was staying. We were all sitting at the bar and then Hillary Clinton suddenly appeared. She was with [personal aide and deputy campaign manager] Huma Abedin, and she walked downstairs, she walked straight past us, she walked over to a little corner, she sat down and ate. Some other campaign aides were there with her and they came over and talked to us and then went back to her table. Then she got up and left. She didn’t even wave when she walked past us or come over and say, “Hey guys, I want to sit and talk with you, but I’m fried and can’t do it, but I’m so happy you’re out together.” I’m thinking, _oh boy here we go_. It became clear to me that Hillary Clinton was not going to be like any candidate I’d ever covered before and that there was not going to be any relationship.

However, there was the Wellesley College connection working in Linskey’s favor. Wellesley—where a young Hillary surprisingly served as president of the Republican club—has always held an important place in Clinton’s life, according to Linskey. “It’s a place that she psychologically comes back to. She’s always welcomed there,” says Linskey. “It’s part of her identity in a way that Chicago, New York, and Arkansas aren’t. It’s like her hometown.”2

Linskey decided to write a Hillary-Wellesley hometown story and take a different angle from earlier biographical articles about Clinton’s college history. “I pitched it to them [the Clinton campaign], and they weren’t really playing ball for a while,” says Linskey, who was asking for a very rare one-on-one with the candidate. While waiting and hoping for the interview, Linskey went ahead and wrote the article but didn’t think it was good without the interview. The _Globe_ held the story.

Then good news. Linskey got a call from Clinton’s traveling press secretary Nick Merrill. “He said that she would likely call in the next few days but added ‘I want to learn a few more details about you so that she will feel comfortable,’” remembers a surprised Linskey, who had never heard of reporters being interviewed themselves before being granted an interview.

Linskey got the impression that this was standard operating procedure in the Clinton campaign, so she went ahead with the process. “It was like it was all going into a memo that was going in her briefing book for our interview.”

Linskey’s telephone interview with Hillary Clinton lasted a full twenty minutes. “It turned out to be one of the longer print interviews she did,” says Linskey. “It was a very good conversation about a very easy topic for her. She was reflective, and I got what I needed for my story.” The story appeared in the _Boston Globe_ on November 28, 2015, under the headline “Wellesley Was a ‘Touchstone’ for Hillary Clinton” and included a photograph of Clinton on commencement day.3 Linskey appreciated getting her Clinton interview. But she was frustrated with the tedious Clinton press processes that were the polar opposite of the freewheeling way press relations were handled at Trump Tower.

Accomplished at making news about himself and his businesses, Trump had for years picked up his phone to banter with the tough New York City press corps. “He’s always been good at being his own spokesman,” said Howard Rubenstein, a New York public relations agent who worked with Trump before he ran for president.4 As a candidate, Trump kept up his do-it-yourself approach to press relations during his presidential campaign, frequently talking to reporters one-on-one from Trump Tower and on the road during his campaign travels. Although he criticized the media in his speeches and was noted for his acerbic Twitter attacks on media outlets and individual reporters, behind the scenes candidate Trump made himself available to the press, just as he had earlier in his career. “He would talk to every last reporter after a debate,” Linskey told the authors.

Unlike the highly structured press organization at the Clinton campaign, there was zero bureaucracy in the Trump press shop. Most often, according to Linskey, reporters would e-mail questions and interview requests to candidate Trump through Hope Hicks, his twenty-seven-year-old press aide, a Greenwich, Connecticut, native and 2010 Southern Methodist University graduate whose father had worked in media relations for the National Football League. Hicks would read reporters’ e-mails to Trump, who would decide how to respond and to whom he wished to talk, and then Hicks would reply to the reporter. “It was very quick,” says Linskey. Hicks had been working for the Trump Organization since 2014, first as a publicist for Ivanka Trump’s fashion line (where her responsibilities included modeling) and then directly for CEO Donald Trump later that same year.5

Fashion Publicist and Model Turned Spinmeister: “The Mystifying Triumph of Hope Hicks, Donald Trump’s Right-Hand Woman”

This was the headline for an in-depth _GQ_ magazine profile of Hicks published in June 2016 while she was managing candidate Trump’s day-to-day contacts with reporters covering his presidential campaign. According to the story, Hicks typically received 250 daily e-mail messages seeking Trump comment or interviews. “One day you’re just a smiley PR lackey; the next, you’re a major operative in the nuttiest campaign in decades. Such is the strange year in the life of Hope Hicks, the 27-year-old accidental press secretary for Donald Trump. How did she get here? And how much longer can she last?” asked reporter Oliva Nuzzi at the top of the _GQ_ Hicks profile.

Nuzzi’s skepticism about Hicks’s longevity may have been well-founded in the midst of the 2016 campaign. But Hicks, who started working for the Trump Organization in 2014 and then for the Trump presidential campaign in 2015, would ultimately become one of Trump’s longest-serving staffers until she resigned as White House communications director at the end of February 2018. The White House confirmed Hicks’s resignation one day after she had given nine hours of closed-door testimony on February 27, 2018, to a congressional committee investigating connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Hicks had refused to answer questions about her work in the White House beyond admitting that she sometimes told “white lies” as the president’s communications director.6

White House communications director Hope Hicks (at far right) is shown here with President Trump in the office of press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders (center) on Saturday, January 20, 2018. After starting as a publicist and part-time model for Ivanka Trump’s fashion line in 2014, Hicks became one of Donald Trump’s closest campaign aides and was named White House communications director in September 2017. Just weeks after this official White House photograph was taken, she resigned her position at the end of February 2018.

The Hicks–Trump connection is how Linskey’s reporter colleague Matt Viser ended up getting four exclusive interviews with Trump for the _Boston Globe_, a newspaper with very liberal, pro-Democratic editorial page writers and readers. Viser took advantage of his second interview with Trump to confront him with a story he was writing about previously unreported instances where Trump acted inappropriately around women. Even after this hard-hitting story by Viser, Trump granted the reporter two more one-on-one interviews. “Yes, I did have reporter envy [of Viser],” says Linskey, a national political reporter who was able to snag only her single Wellesley-themed interview with Clinton during the 2015–2016 presidential campaign.

Clinton and her team played it cautious with reporters because they—and nearly every reporter and political insider—completely believed Hillary had the presidency in the bag. The Clinton team wasn’t that concerned about reaching their target voters via the news media because, in their minds, they were convinced they were going to win in November. Controlling media contact and avoiding media mistakes was the name of the game for Clinton. Behind in all the polls, the expected loser Trump had little downside to playing the press risky and freewheeling. He sought to use free media coverage to fire up his base of conservative and disaffected populist voters by generating often controversial headlines with his off-the-cuff remarks and his unfiltered tweets to followers that were then given a national audience by major news organizations. Trump’s freewheeling approach with the news media and his frequent use of Twitter reinforced his message as the “outsider” candidate who campaigned unconventionally.

One reason this worked was because Trump was very practiced at being Trump. _Let Trump Be Trump_ blares the title of an insider book by former campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bosse.7 Even though he was confronted with controversy after controversy that would have killed any other candidate, Trump didn’t think he needed to rely on a staff of professional PR handlers to mediate between him and the media. He’d been doing it himself for years as a businessman and was doing it well enough as a presidential candidate. Yet, as we will see next, this do-it-yourself approach didn’t work so well for another Republican rookie presidential candidate who, like Trump, was an underdog that leapt to the front of the pack. Like Trump, he was a media-savvy, charismatic businessman accused of sexual misconduct. His name is Herman Cain, and he ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.

# A Failure of Crisis Management: “Let Herman Be Herman”

“Let Herman be Herman” was one of the favorite sayings of Mark Block, manager of Herman Cain’s campaign for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. Cain was a successful businessman—he had been president of a national pizza chain—and was a powerful speaker with a natural sense of humor and a strong television presence. When Block signed on, Cain was only an asterisk in the polls. But by late October 2011, national polling found Cain in a dead heat with front-runner Mitt Romney. The “let Herman be Herman” strategy seemed to be working.

Cain’s campaign is chronicled in our case study “The Audacity of Smoke: The Rise and Fall of the Unorthodox Herman Cain Campaign,” which can be found in Appendix D]]. Like Trump, Cain forged an insurgent outsider campaign targeting populists and conservatives. Both Trump and Cain ran personality-centered campaigns and repeated a few simple policy positions. Both Cain and Trump were essentially their own campaign manager and press spokesman, operating with small and largely inexperienced staffs. Just as Trump in the 2015–2016 Republican presidential primaries, Cain in 2011 didn’t rely on costly TV advertising but used the Internet and free television coverage to build his base of support. Campaign manager Mark Block says the campaign was swamped with requests for Cain TV appearances. Cain was at his best on late-night talk shows like those of Jay Leno and David Letterman as well as daytime talk shows like _The View_ with their large audiences of female voters.8

Cain’s free TV appearances helped feed an aggressive online program that was building a national database of supporters and donors. The digital campaign included video content produced in-house by the small campaign staff. One day in October 2011, campaign manager Block was being videotaped giving a fundraising pep talk to be posted on Cain’s website. On a lark, the Cain cameraman suggested Block end his remarks by taking an on-screen puff of his ever-present Marlboro. The smoking video went viral, the campaign’s servers temporarily crashed, and, Block told us, the campaign raised $3 million in just a few days. The Cain Train, as his supporters liked to call the campaign, had momentum.

With Cain’s TV skills honed by his numerous talk show appearances, it was time to step up to the major leagues: the network Sunday morning interview shows where Cain had standing invitations from all of them. They decided to debut on CBS’s _Face the Nation_ hosted by veteran TV journalist Bob Schieffer, who was thought to be less aggressive than NBC’s Tim Russert, a former Democratic congressional staffer known for ambushing guests with his research.

Cain had once been a panel member on _Face the Nation_, appearing with other guests to answer Schieffer’s questions. This would be his first one-on-one interview, but Cain felt comfortable, and his small staff, including his inexperienced press secretary, spent only a couple of hours preparing Cain for Schieffer. A larger communications and research staff—like Hillary Clinton’s—might have discovered that Schieffer was a survivor of bladder cancer and an outspoken critic of smoking. An aggressive press team might have gotten Schieffer’s producers to divulge that the program would open with Mark Block’s smoking video.

Early Sunday morning, October 30, an underprepared Herman Cain sat in CBS’s studios in downtown Washington and watched in complete surprise as Block’s online video played on the studio monitors. Then Schieffer asked his first question:

SCHIEFFER: Mr. Cain, I just have to ask you, what is the point of that, having a man smoke a cigarette in a television commercial for you?

CAIN: One of the themes within this campaign is let Herman be Herman. Mark Block is a smoker, and we say let Mark be Mark. That’s all we’re trying to say, because we believe let people be people. He doesn’t deny that he’s a smoker. This isn’t trying . . .

SCHIEFFER: Are you a smoker?

CAIN: No, I’m not a smoker. But I don’t have a problem if that’s his choice. So let Herman be Herman; let Mark be Mark. Let people be people. This wasn’t intended to send any subliminal signal whatsoever.

“Let Herman be Herman” might get a laugh on Jay Leno, but Schieffer wasn’t buying it and continued to grill Cain on the smoking video. It was this exchange that made the news. Smoking video clips were featured on all the network and cable news programs that Sunday. But the smoking video soon would be the least of Cain’s problems.

As Cain, his wife, and a few campaign staffers left the CBS studios, they were approached by Jonathan Martin, who was then a top reporter for _Politico_, the political news website. Martin had been working on a story about Cain but had been repeatedly unsuccessful in getting any response from the Cain campaign. On the spur of the moment, the frustrated Martin decided on Sunday morning to wait for Cain outside the CBS bureau.

“Have you ever been accused sir, in your life, of harassment by a woman?” Martin repeatedly asked, despite Mrs. Cain standing nearby. When Martin mentioned the name of one of Cain’s accusers, Cain said, “I have no comment on that,” before getting in his vehicle and departing. The _Politico_ story was published at 8:00 p.m. that Sunday evening:

> During Herman Cain’s tenure as the head of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s, at least two female employees complained to colleagues and senior association officials about inappropriate behavior by Cain, ultimately leaving their jobs at the trade group, multiple sources confirm to POLITICO.
> 
> The women complained of sexually suggestive behavior by Cain that made them angry and uncomfortable, the sources said, and they signed agreements with the restaurant group that gave them financial payouts to leave the association.9

Figure 9.1 Life Cycle of the Cain Campaign

**How are we doing?** These graphs show the life cycle of the Cain campaign. Cain’s strong performances in debates and straw polls during September and October generated increased mentions of him in online news media and social media (top line). The Cain buzz was mostly positive from mid-September to mid-October but began turning negative after Block’s infamous smoking video was released on the Cain website (middle line). Cain’s poll numbers began to drop after a negative _Politico_ story was published on October 30 and other women came forward with their stories of inappropriate behavior by Cain (bottom line). He suspended his campaign on December 3. For additional background on the events shown in this graph, see Appendix D]], “The Audacity of Smoke: The Rise and Fall of the Unorthodox Herman Cain Campaign.”

This was the first time anyone on Cain’s staff had heard of the matter. An experienced communications team would have kept Cain away from the press while they gathered the facts and fashioned a disciplined response. The most important and painful rule of crisis management is to get all the bad news out as quickly as possible. Instead of sheltering and strategizing, “Let Herman be Herman” Cain decided he could talk his way out and kept the week’s schedule of planned interviews and speeches.

Cain’s story kept changing during his campaign appearances that first week as reporters pressed him. Block didn’t do any better when he made his first-ever appearances on cable news programs. Meanwhile, there was the inevitable drip of new bad news about Cain’s behavior with women. Cain’s poll numbers and donations plummeted. Just thirty-four days after the first _Politico_ story, former front-runner Herman Cain suspended his presidential campaign on December 3.10

Cain’s team, including Block, were mostly campaign rookies.11 But it’s unlikely that even the most experienced crisis management staff could have salvaged Cain’s candidacy. Most of the Republican voters supporting Cain had been supporters only for a month or two, and most had second-choice candidates in the crowded Republican primary field. Cain hadn’t had time to build a deep voter support base that might stick with him during the revelations about his past mistreatment of women. When the bad news hit, the Cain campaign turned out to be a real-life house of cards. More likely to survive scandal are well-established public figures such as Ronald Reagan in Iran-Contra, and multiscandal survivors Bill Clinton and Donald Trump; all three men could, in times of trouble, depend on their core support bases built up over years of being in the public eye.

At minimum, a more experienced Cain management team would have gotten Herman to confess his past transgressions months earlier. The best campaigns anticipate bad news and plan how to minimize and manage any negative effects using earned, or free, media where they can shape the revelations in forums and at times of their choosing. Cain’s campaign didn’t do this, and he dropped out. Jeb Bush’s did, and he became governor of Florida.

# Inoculation: Preparing for Bad News

In 1998, Republican Jeb Bush ran for governor of Florida against Democratic lieutenant governor Buddy MacKay. Bush had lost in 1994 against incumbent governor Lawton Chiles. Before Bush could fully launch his candidacy in 1998, his campaign had a matter to settle with the state’s media outlets. Bush had some past business dealings that his campaign knew could be used against him in the campaign—so it quietly began preparing the media for the information to come out.12

The Bush campaign collected a team of accountants, attorneys, and people who had worked with him on some private business ventures. For example, Bush had invested in an extremely lucrative company called M&W Pump Company that built wells in Nigeria.13

But Bush’s father, George H. W. Bush, had been vice president at the time, and there were State Department cables indicating that the ambassador of Nigeria had been notified that the vice president’s son was coming for a visit. Understandably, there were questions about whether there had been improper influence used on his behalf to secure some of these deals.

The Nigeria episode was only one example of many issues related to Bush’s business interests that could crop up during what they expected to be a hotly contested race. The campaign began to identify everyone involved with the company.14

The campaign found that despite potential issues, there was no wrongdoing and no improprieties on Bush’s part. It found that Bush was frequently not very hands-on in some of the deals but recognized that it didn’t matter because he was, at the very least, associated with the dealings. It had to know every single meeting that he attended, when he attended, and with whom he met. The campaign had to do their own freedom of information request for State Department cables. It had to identify the pilots of the private planes he flew into Nigeria. The campaign collected notebook after notebook on every one of these potential land mines, so it was prepared to deal with them if and when they went off.15

From there, it strategized about how to release the information on its own terms. The campaign held long meetings talking about how it was going to alert the media. Due to the complexity of the business deals, it concluded that the average political reporter hadn’t had enough exposure to business to understand how the deals worked. Ultimately, it decided to give the information to reporters from the _Wall Street Journal_ and other news outlets. It provided the information the campaign had so these national reporters could write the definitive “Jeb Bush and the business deals” story.16

Thus, the story went public even before the campaign went public. Although the story wasn’t flattering for Bush, it wasn’t fatal. (The _New York Times_ ran an in-depth story about Bush’s business dealings months before he declared his 2016 presidential candidacy; this, too, seemed to have no impact on his chances in the primary.)17 Public interest in Bush’s Nigerian business dealings died quickly. Because of the timing and the manner of the story’s release, the Bush campaign was able to diffuse what could have become a damaging story line. The Bush team released the story on its own terms, using what is known as “earned” media (rather than “paid” media) to push out its story at a time and place of its choosing.18 Bush went on to win the election 55.3 percent to 44.7 percent over MacKay, and was reelected in 2002.

# How Do We Reach Them? What Do We Tell Them?

Today’s campaign managers work in an information environment that’s constantly being changed by technology. These changes make their jobs trickier; at the same time, they now have many paths they can use to shape the campaign’s narrative arc and deliver their messages to their voter targets. The emergence of e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter has forced campaign managers to adapt. But to be effective, campaign spinmeisters need policy wonks on their teams so they can use the campaign’s ideas to sharpen differences with opponents and signal to voters their positions on the race’s biggest issues. Even if the candidate’s policy planks never make it into law, they can nonetheless generate media coverage; frame narratives about each side’s plans, ideals, and values; and shade how reporters discuss candidates and their respective governing agendas. (For more on the role of policy and ideology in campaigns and elections, see Chapter 6]].)

If the campaign’s message is delivered through earned media, it can provide free publicity for or against a side and influence the election at the margins. And integral to what message is sent is both what a campaign says about itself and what a campaign says about its opponent. Put differently, the campaign’s research (self and opposition) shapes and drives the campaign’s message, and the message box featured in Chapter 8]] gets filled in once the campaign learns something about itself and information about the other person. The message grid is informed by each side’s positions on policy issues.

Earned media is complicated by one of the biggest changes campaign managers have faced in recent years—the rise of digital media, birthing a perilous landscape all must navigate. And, although TV ads remain the biggest drain on a campaign’s budget, earned media can offset some of the impact of television ads by shaping the narrative arc of each side. The messages delivered through earned and “unfiltered” media shape the image of the candidates in the public mind and influence the impressions voters develop about each campaign. Earned media can tarnish a candidate’s standing, give a campaign credibility, drive voters to the polls, and turn off voters, all depending on the circumstances and type of news coverage a campaign is generating. One of Donald Trump’s insights during his 2016 White House run was that he could use Twitter, cable news shows, and newspapers to generate what tracking firm mediaQuant in March 2016 estimated to be a remarkable $2 billion worth of free media. Cable channels felt compelled to air his boisterous, sometimes outrageous rallies more than his rivals’, and media outlets of all kinds reported on his tweetstorms in which he often tarred his enemies with demeaning nicknames (“low energy” Jeb Bush, for example), blasted the mainstream media as “fake news,” and fed reporters and pundits controversial policy bits that they swiftly consumed. That March, the _New York Times_ wrote that Trump “is far better than any other candidate—maybe than any candidate ever—at earning media.”19 Thus, in response to the question, “How do we reach them?” Trump, a first-time candidate, broke new ground. Earned media—televised interviews; unscripted calls with reporters; and a steady diet of sensational, bombastic tweets—delivered him enormous free media coverage that helped him to dominate the news cycle, draw supporters to his camp, and spread his message about himself and his opponents.

During the early nineteenth century, campaign managers did not need to worry about a multimillion-dollar media budget or how to raise the money to pay for it. For campaign managers, the media was easier to navigate than it is nowadays. Instead, campaign managers focused on winning a communications “air war” fought primarily through printed handbills, newspaper reporting, and word of mouth. And yet, although the delivery vehicles have expanded, campaign managers remain focused on the core questions of “How do we reach them?” and “What do we tell them?”—all in the hopes of improving one’s vote total at the margins.

Of course, the media changes of late have some precedent in changes that occurred almost a century ago. During the 1920s and 1930s, radio began to enable presidents to communicate their messages to voters without a filter. Franklin Roosevelt used fireside radio chats to communicate his key messages in easily understood words and imagery. Television’s rise during the 1950s marked another breakthrough in the use of technology to deliver the message directly to voters. Richard Nixon’s 1952 televised “Checkers” speech, in which he defended himself from charges that he had a personal campaign slush fund, saved his position as the number two on Eisenhower’s presidential ticket. Both Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama used unfiltered televised addresses to talk to their partisans directly and launch themselves as plausible presidential candidates—the former in 1964 (“A Time for Choosing”), the latter in 2004 (Democratic Keynote Convention Address).

Much has changed in the past decades since television became a political force. A half century ago, campaign press releases were hand-delivered to the local bureaus of the Associated Press and United Press International, local newspapers, and television and radio news departments. Less time-sensitive press releases were actually mailed, which, in a larger state, could mean hundreds of pieces of first-class mail had to be paid for, addressed, and stuffed by campaign staff and volunteers every week.20 Cell phones did not exist, so the traveling candidate and his road team stayed in touch with the campaign headquarters by placing collect or credit card calls through pay phones. Before mobile phones, there was no way for the headquarters to reach the candidate or his traveling staff and brief them on a breaking news story or to suggest that the candidate make a statement in response to something said by his opponent. The principal point of communication was the campaign’s scheduler, who relayed over the telephone information to and from the candidate and his traveling staff or driver.

**1970s political new media.** Manufactured by Exxon, the Qwip first-generation portable fax machine enabled the campaign headquarters to stay in touch with the candidate on the road.

In the 1970s, however, this world slowly began to quicken and grow more complicated. The Exxon Corporation introduced the Qwip, a first-generation portable fax machine that enabled the campaign headquarters to stay in touch with the candidate on the road. Political professionals also found new ways to reach voters with their direct communications. In 1982, President Reagan started to deliver his weekly radio address in order, he said, “to bring the facts to the people as succinctly as I can cram in five minutes,” bypassing the mainstream media that he thought was often misinformed.21

Other innovations would soon follow. Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign used live satellite television interviews to target more voters in key markets. Clinton and his surrogates sat in a studio or near a satellite uplink truck where they would conduct back-to-back interviews with local television news reporters and anchors—reaching viewers in critical places where they believed the election would be decided.22 “The cost of satellite time was about $500 per hour,” said Jeff Eller, mastermind of the Clinton effort. “In an hour, I could get $500,000 of free airtime on local television news broadcasts.”

Clinton’s team also built the first website for a campaign. The site featured some basic information—Clinton’s speeches, policies, and biographical material. But it marked an important moment. Of more than 140 campaign managers we surveyed, many of them said the most significant change they’ve experienced in their careers is the impact of the Internet on campaigns and elections. In 2008, the _New York Times_ claimed that Obama’s use of the Internet in that year’s campaign “changed politics” and the conduct of elections—using e-mail to raise money from small donors and mobilizing volunteers in swing states where the outcome would be decided.23

The culture of the media also began to shift some forty years ago when the _Washington Post_’s Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein helped uncover the Watergate scandal. Reporters became more suspicious of the politicians they covered; dug more strenuously for wrongdoing; and began to report on candidates’ sex lives, mental and physical health, and business backgrounds. Reports of Gary Hart’s philandering sunk his 1988 presidential campaign.

The subsequent proliferation of blogs and quasi-news websites ended the days when elite institutions decided what was news and set the national news agenda for the United States. Another turning point occurred in 1998 when iconoclastic blogger Matt Drudge was the first person to reveal on his website that reporters were investigating charges that President Clinton had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. The revelation forced traditional media to begin covering the story, touching off a feeding frenzy that lasted for more than a year.

The landscape of 2018 is even speedier, more fractured, more partisan, and more unforgiving than it was when the Lewinsky scandal broke. Cell phone video is ubiquitous (remember Mitt Romney’s 47 percent and Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comments?), and virtually any utterance by a candidate or campaign official is now considered fair game for the press. Recorded statements from long ago can be unearthed and dominate campaign news cycles, such as in October 2016 when the _Washington Post_ revealed audio and video footage of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, the so-called _Access Hollywood_ tape. Gaffes and stumbles can hijack a campaign’s message, impeding the manager’s ability to build the campaign’s narrative and shape the election results on the margins. The managers we talked to described today’s media landscape as among their tougher challenges—one that they were still coming to grips with. At the same time, our interviews revealed, campaign managers still have a healthy respect for the press’s role in campaigns and elections. They often sought to feed them stories that both benefited their cause and were honest, and they cultivated relationships with reporters and sought to build up mutual trust.

# “Your Best Friend or Your Worst Enemy”

This all raises some of the questions at the center of this book: How do campaign managers use earned media to affect the electoral margins? How do their media strategies matter? How do they shape the campaign narrative arc, seeking to influence one side’s share and performance on election day? There’s no single, or simple, answer.

Campaign managers revealed that they have two ways of delivering their messages: paid media such as television and radio ads, online advertising, and direct mail; and earned media such as TV, radio, or newspaper interviews; press releases; tweets; speeches; and campaign blog posts that can get picked up by the wider media world and reach voters, mobilize volunteers, and raise money. Campaign managers also said that the raw material affected what they told the press and, ultimately, the voters. This included such information as the campaign’s poll numbers, the opposition research, the price of oil, the unemployment rate, and where the Dow stood a month before election day.

Campaigns typically formulated their messages through collaboration among the candidate, the campaign manager, and key aides, their collective goal being to keep the campaign flowing in the right direction, as our campaign model (see Chapter 1]]) illustrates. Reed Galen, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 2006 campaign manager in his California governor’s race, told us that earned media mattered because during most campaigns the press “can be your best friend or your worst enemy.”24 He argued that the best campaigns laid out early on “from a campaign’s perspective what is it you want the press to cover” and then found ways to get reporters to cover it accordingly—all in the hopes of delivering their core messages to voters and influencing their side’s share and performance.25

Additionally, earned media was important, managers argued, to blunt storylines that had the potential to depress their side’s turnout or offend undecided voters. The reality, campaign managers told us, is that the contemporary press corps is biased not in a partisan direction but rather toward sensational stories and horse-race analysis. Eager to draw as many eyeballs as possible and lure advertisers online, media companies are in a furious competition for readers and clicks that magnifies the coverage given to campaign stumbles.26

This was hardly a welcome development in the eyes of the managers we talked to. Galen, for example, told us that most political reporters are searching for “a different angle. They want something interesting to write about.”27 But, managers added, recognizing this reality, they could then develop a feel for what was controversial and stay a step ahead of opponents by feeding the media negative press about foes and finding ways to burnish their side’s story.

# Earning Media

Earned media can take countless forms. For example, campaign manager Casey Phillips told us that in one of his races, he actually had a “college Republican [dress up] as a giant waffle.” The student followed their opponent around—to cement his image as “Waffle Man.” That stunt helped Phillips break through in a highly competitive media climate.28

Some campaign managers tried to affect the vote margins by cultivating local newspapers and local radio and television stations to expand a candidate’s name ID and show voters that she knew about the issues that mattered to them in their towns, hamlets, and cities. Graham Shafer, Van Hilleary’s campaign manager in the 2002 Tennessee governor’s race, was seeking to depict Hilleary as “a pretty normal guy.” To communicate that message in ways that garnered earned media, the campaign sent the candidate on twenty-four-hour tours of local communities—a 1:00 a.m. diner stop, a 5:00 a.m. hand-shaking with factory workers arriving for their shifts. The media was invited and often followed Hilleary on these stops, and Shafer made a point of focusing on local editors and reporters and weekly local papers; community radio stations; and local events including moon pie, tomato, and RC Cola festivals—all of which led to positive coverage in local media venues.29

Shafer recalled that Hilleary was one of the first candidates “to use a stock car NASCAR-type sponsorship” to garner earned media and promote the campaign’s average Joe message. The campaign gave the driver “a $10,000 donation that paid for his tires for the season,” Shafer told us. And with that modest investment, “we got signage over the whole vehicle, on the side panels, on the back, on the roof, everything. And so we actually used that in a lot of situations.” He said that “ultimately we put the car and the driver in the [campaign] ad using the tagline with Van, saying, . . . ‘We’ll get Tennessee fixed in no time flat.’”30

These weren’t just empty-headed gimmicks. As Shafer pointed out, the near single-minded focus on local events and local media, and by using a sport that Tennesseans loved, Hilleary gained an edge in the quest to influence the election results. He used these strategies to show voters that he understood their lives and that he was like them, which helped voters identify with him and helped Hilleary compete statewide. Even though he lost that race by around 50,000 votes out of more than 1.5 million votes cast, Hilleary arguably would have suffered a bigger defeat had he and Shafer not cultivated the local press through their aggressive earned media strategies. Even though they were narrowly defeated, their earned media was effective on the campaign’s margins.31

Other campaign managers described similar stunts that rooted their candidates in their local communities, linked them to popular issue positions, and identified them as candidates in touch with people’s lives. Karl Koch, who ran Democrat Lawton Chiles’s 1994 Florida governor’s race, recalled that when “Chiles first ran for United States Senate in 1970,” he “walked the length of Florida from Pensacola to Key West. And so ever since then, he was known as Walking Lawton. And . . . we literally walk. We’d go in a community and he’d walk from point A to point B and 200, 300 people would follow him everywhere he went.” Although Koch admitted it was a “gimmick,” Walking Lawton became “his campaign trademark that was guaranteed to build a crowd, guaranteed to get media”—and it delivered their message to undecided voters and Chiles’s partisans at the same time. Branding Chiles as somebody who knew Florida’s communities and understood its diverse neighborhoods and peoples was instrumental in cementing his reputation as a major figure in Florida elections.32

Because campaigns are seeking to affect the margins of the vote by reaching voters through earned and paid media, some campaign managers described micro-events, targeting relatively small numbers of voters whom they hoped would be difference makers on election day. Even a handful of voters were important to some statewide campaigns. Mary Landrieu’s 2008 U.S. Senate campaign manager, Jay Howser, told us that in Louisiana they developed a “community dinner program that . . . was a great tool for our field staff” in helping turn out their reliable supporters. “What we would do is target voters in some parish or in some town or a subset of voters and have a free community dinner,” he went on to explain.33

> And we would cater the food, and we would have our field staff call those people, and while they’re calling, they also ID them and invite them. And we would get between . . . 75 and 150 people there at these dinners. It was a great kind of field effort . . . in places like Lafayette parish or . . . Lake Charles parish. It was a great field, it was great politically, and the local newspaper and TV showed up as well.34

These dinners typically garnered favorable coverage for Landrieu’s campaign—a series of small events earning positive free news and affecting the electorate a handful of votes at a time. Running in a deep-red state, Landrieu needed every conceivable vote to win her race.

Charlie Melancon’s Louisiana US Senate campaign piggybacked on a much-publicized National Football League controversy involving the New Orleans Saints as a strategy to sign up volunteers and generate positive earned media. The NFL ordered shops in New Orleans to stop selling clothes with the Saints tagline “Who Dat?,” claiming that the NFL held the rights to the popular phrase. Bradley Beychok explained that when he ran Melancon’s campaign, his side launched a petition urging the NFL to let Louisianans use the phrase on their apparel. The petition generated some 75,000 signatures and gave the campaign a “bump” with voters and helped break through Louisiana’s cluttered media landscape. Beychok further recalled that Melancon visited small-town newspapers and took pictures with editors and garnered “noncontentious” stories and interviews about the candidate’s policy goals and priorities. Such earned media coverage is invaluable at reaching local voters in these communities. And finally, when Beychok heard from local reporters that they weren’t interested in a story Beychok deemed important, his strategy was to peddle the story to national political media such as _Politico_, Talking Points Memo, and cable news shows; then, once the story ran, he’d tell the local editor, “You got to cover this.” Beychok’s media strategy is simple: “Local is best.”35 But he described the “new class of media” as a key way to generate stories that pressured local and state media to ape their coverage, thus influencing share and performance.36

# Digital and Social Media

Virtually all campaign managers are seeking to tilt the media’s narrative about their races just slightly to their advantage, but the answer to “How do we reach them?” increasingly comes down to direct communications between the candidates and their followers. Campaigns continue to rely on standard techniques such as press releases reporters can quote when writing their stories, as well as stump speeches and news interviews yielding sound bites reporters can drop into their radio and television spots. Handling newer forms of political media, such as bloggers and the Twitter universe, has been a much more vexing challenge for most of the campaign managers we surveyed. Yet Twitter and blogs have become increasingly vital to spreading the campaign’s message. As Republican advertising consultant Brad Todd observed, campaign managers now have the power to “give it to a blog” and “move things through the press and what we call earned media.” He explained the rationale: “You give to a blog first, then you take the blog to a more mainstream reporter and say, ‘See, the blogs are beating you on this. Better cover it.’”37

That has indeed become a go-to strategy for many of the professionals we interviewed. Kelly Evans, who managed Christine Gregoire’s 2008 Washington governor’s race, argued that traditional news sources were still “really important.” But she also remarked that reporters are clearly reading political blogs, adding, “getting your stuff up on political blogs is sometimes the first thing” she liked to do. Evans had Gregoire “spend time talking to bloggers,” and she described a full-bore media campaign seeking to disseminate their side’s message in the hopes of shaping voters’ impressions of the race and, ultimately, using the media to influence who people voted for. “We did everything,” Evans told us.38

> We did traditional press conferences. We sent out press releases, whether it was positive or negative stuff. The state party did most of the attacking of our opponent. But we made web videos that got posted. The party did that. Or they’d make web videos about our opponent. And we’d post those and try to get attention to those. . . . We tried to use all the tools that were available to us at the time. We did regular weekly communications to the press that went out via e-mail. The governor would spend one-on-one time with reporters.
> 
> And we thought it was necessary to try to shape the media narrative and give Gregoire a slight advantage in what was widely seen as a closely contested race for governor—but the blogs were a vital component of the overall media strategy to drive the campaign’s message to the public.39

Yet it isn’t simply the rise of blogs that has empowered campaign managers to garner earned media and influence the election’s margins. The news cycle’s warp speed also poses a set of complicated challenges for political pros seeking to control their message and keep the campaign on a winning course. Even legacy media such as the _New York Times_ and NBC News are continually updating their websites with breaking news, and the cliché is true—the news cycle truly is nonstop. News outlets have to cover breaking stories twenty-four hours a day, and cable news outlets have more time they need to fill. There are more stories to cover and more time to cover them. “Each cycle gets faster and faster,” Shafer, Van Hilleary’s campaign manager, observed, “to the point where . . . you almost feel like you don’t have a news cycle.” Campaigns, he explained, need “to be on top of a story the minute it breaks with traditional and social media tools.”

Equally challenging, Shafer argued, is that the message—or a message harmful to a campaign—can be delivered in “multiple ways” at blinding speed, and campaigns are facing off against tweeters and “bloggers . . . who are not trained. When I say trained, I mean educated journalists. They’re educated people, but they didn’t go to school for media or journalism. They’re you and I, and they have the power to turn on a computer, Facebook, tweet, and Instagram a message.” That’s why Shafer insists that communicating his side’s message through partisans in the digital media world is crucial; “they take sides, [and] they’ve got their jersey on.” Shafer is determined to “cultivate a relationship with them in real time, where they’re feeding you information and you’re feeding them information. And a lot of times you now deliver stories into blogs rather than going into direct news media,” likely because the blogs will pick it up immediately.40

# Working And Helping The Refs

Behind the scenes, campaign managers are engaged in a fierce jockeying to deliver their messages to voters in ways that will gain a small advantage for their candidates. Bloggers and reporters alike enjoy attention and appreciate help doing their job, and campaigns need them to spread their messages and policy ideas. Thus, the managers we surveyed almost all cultivated bloggers, reporters, and editors whom they thought could be helpful in getting their message to targeted voters. Matt McDonald, who helped run Democrat Elia Pirozzi’s 1998 California congressional race, explained how his campaign “reap[ed] a lot of benefits” by being “forthright, friendly,” and generating goodwill with reporters “just by returning calls and having accurate information and following through with very simple commitments to reporters. They’ll treat you better if they feel like you’re treating them with respect.”41 He added this:

> The inclination particularly in Republican circles is to tell the media to take a flying leap and that’s absolutely the wrong strategy because, as much as you might think that they’re out to get you, yeah, they are, they’re out to get everyone. I mean, they’re out to get your opponent too. They’re out for a good story, no matter what. And you’re not going to change that by hiding in a hole and pretending that they aren’t there because, guess what, they buy their ink by a barrel and don’t go to war against somebody who buys ink by the barrel. You’re going to lose.42

Campaign managers were critical of the press, but they neither loathed nor feared the reporters who covered their races. More often than not, they actually valued their role in the democratic process, notwithstanding the press corps’ sizable warts. Martha McKenna, who learned her trade at EMILY’s List, said her approach as a campaign manager was to “be in touch with the media all the time.” She added that some managers were unjustifiably “afraid of the press” and worried that reporters were “going to screw them at every turn and . . . write bad stories about you.” But, she echoed McDonald, reporters for the most part were simply trying to do their jobs and didn’t “have a political ax to grind,” and they needed to be treated fairly. Managers, she argued, had to build relationships with reporters, “give them leads, pitch them stories,” and give them access to their candidates to give their side the best shot at influencing the election’s margins. Managers, she concluded, “have a responsibility to their candidate to have relationships with reporters in the district and to be representing them well.”43

McKenna didn’t see a formula for certain success, for sure; however, she argued, by giving reporters access and cementing those relationships, a campaign increased its chances that the stories would at least be fair and that their side of the policy argument and message would get aired—giving her campaign the best shot to inspire its partisans and persuade swing voters to support her side.44

Democrat Screven Watson, who ran Rod Smith’s 2006 Florida gubernatorial campaign, agreed that in order to improve his candidates’ chances, campaign managers had to continually work the referees. “You’ve got to be . . . proactive with the press,” he told us. Reporters, he explained, are sitting at their desks, reading blogs, texts, e-mails, and tweets, and in today’s environment they were hard-pressed to dig for stories and launch their own investigations. Watson argued that by building rapport with the press and looking for a series of little stories that helped his side’s argument, his campaign could find success. People in politics, he said, “want to have the front page [story] that I’ve got a company relocated to Tampa that’s going to create 1,000 jobs. Great. If you can do it, I’m not saying don’t do it. But if you do a bunch of little things—working the press,” being honest with them, building relationships, and feeding them usable nuggets—it can get a campaign’s message out on earned media. The little victories, he concluded, added up to bigger ones that can affect election results.45

Trust, honesty, and relationship building also defined Raul Labrador’s earned media strategy, according to his 2010 Idaho congressional campaign manager China Gum. Gum told us that their goal was to make their campaign the honest brokers in the race. They knew that their opponents were sending out multiple press releases daily, spinning relentlessly, sending reporters “on a lot of goose chases.” Gum realized that Labrador’s campaign was best served by being trustworthy and giving the media “the honest, straight-up answer, and that when we gave them something, they could trust that it was what we truly believed and we weren’t trying to stretch anything. . . . That was really important to Raul. He wanted us to be the trustworthy ones.”46 Gum observed the following:

> Some campaigns will put out multiple press releases throughout the day with misinformation to see what they could get to stick. We never did that. We only sent out press releases when there was something totally legitimate going on. . . . So the media tended to trust what we had happening. If we said something about our opponent, it came with footnotes and facts, not a wild goose chase. So I had a great relationship with the media.47

Labrador went on to score a big upset over his Republican primary opponent, and then he bested his general election foe, a Democratic incumbent, by nearly 10 percent. Their strategy wasn’t the lone difference maker, but it helped put Labrador in position to become a member of Congress.

# The Changing News Landscape

President Trump enjoys using new media Twitter to berate the traditional media. “The failing _New York Times_”—which Trump has read every day for decades—is a favorite target. Trump sent out this tweet very early in the morning on July 27, 2017.

![[69.jpeg]]

Twitter

Overall print newspaper readership is in decline (see Figure 9.2]]), but the _New York Times_ is not failing. Just two hours after Trump’s tweet, the _New York Times_ sent out its own tweet announcing record high quarterly earnings of $15.6 million.48 Driving profits was a dramatic increase in paid online subscriptions during the 2016 presidential campaign. Ironically, Donald Trump was helping the “failing New York Times” make more money.

Trump is known to be a voracious consumer of television cable news. In addition to watching his favorite conservative channel Fox News, it’s been reported that Trump also “hate watches” his coverage on MSNBC and CNN, according to a front-page December 2017 _New York Times_ story, “Inside Trump’s Hour-by-Hour Battle for Self-Preservation.”49 Just as he’s boosted online readership and revenues for the _New York Times_, Trump has been good for the cable news industry. The percentage of adults who report watching any cable news has been in long-term decline (see Figure 9.2]]), but the combined 2017 cable news ratings for CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News during the first year of the Trump administration were a full 36 percent higher than during the comparable period of the first Obama administration.50

Some managers mourned the loss of multiple, traditional press outlets such as the demise of local newspapers. Fifteen or twenty years ago, such papers would enable campaigns to target voters through earned media. Democrat Chris Kelly’s California attorney general campaign manager, Katie Merrill, pointed out the following:

> In the Bay Area, you used to have the _San Jose Mercury News_, _San Francisco Chronicle_, _Oakland Tribune_, the _Contra Costa Times_. And now the _Contra Costa Times_, the _Oakland Tribune_, and the _San Jose Mercury News_ are all one paper. So instead of having all these mini-markets within a media market, mini-newspaper markets in the media markets to try to pitch your stories, now you’ve got two instead of four.52

![[70.jpeg]]

Figure 9.2 Shrinking News Media Usage Challenges Today’s Campaigns, 2014–2017

**Self-reported news media usage.** The percentage of American adults who say they consume traditional news media like newspapers and cable news has markedly declined according to annual surveys of 200,000+ adults conducted by Nielsen Scarborough. The most resilient traditional media are local TV newscasts—a favorite place for political ads—and the nightly network newscasts on NBC, CBS, and ABC.

_Source:_ Nielsen Scarborough USA+ national adult 18+ surveys—2014 release 2 to 2017 release 1. Graphic by John Jay.

That contraction made it much harder for her to get their message heard through the local press. “It’s just very, very difficult to get stories written,” Merrill explained. “You don’t have as many reporters to pitch to. And there [are] a lot of young, inexperienced reporters as the older reporters have taken buyouts” due to the downsizing of media companies.53

The result for campaigns, says Merrill, is that “whereas you really could do microtargeting with your earned media, . . . you just can’t anymore. . . . And it’s unfortunate because it just makes it more difficult to communicate with voters without having to pay for it,” especially in a state as sprawling and populous as California. Thus, during Kelly’s 2010 run, Merrill decided to target the Sacramento press corps in the hopes of “getting stories written that would . . . frame the campaign” and “get Chris viable” in Sacramento “as a means of then getting him viable to the voters.” She was pleased with the results. Her campaign was able to push the “truth about the front-runner’s [Kamala Harris] record,” in addition to burnishing Kelly’s credentials, and “we were just slamming it all the time on the earned media side.” Although Kelly came in virtually tied for second in the Democratic primary, his campaign was ultimately credible, breaking through a crowded, seven-person field and theoretically setting him up for a future run at statewide office. Even though he lost, his earned media strategy elevated his visibility and deepened his political credibility.54

Other campaign managers whose side was leading in the polls opted to take their feet off the pedal as much as possible. Their goal was to keep their campaign out of the media’s glare and deprive their lesser-known rivals of garnering free publicity. They wanted the dynamic to remain static. Campaign manager Michael Sullivan told us that during Todd Rokita’s 2010 Indiana campaign for Congress, his goal was “to be very quiet because if we made noise, the media would notice.”55 Attention, in this case, was the last thing the front-runner desired. Sullivan hoped to keep the contest low-profile and controversy-free to cement his position in first place; thus, his campaign had figured out that it was doing quite well, and its goal was to monitor what its opponents were doing and keep its candidate from making unwelcome news. That strategy paid off. Rokita took 42 percent of the vote in a thirteen-person Republican primary, becoming his party’s nominee, and he easily won the general election in the heavily Republican district.

Garnering earned media can also help qualify candidates as legitimate contenders simply because they are featured in stories. In Barack Obama’s 2004 Illinois Senate primary run, the future president had trouble garnering earned media attention in the early going. His campaign manager, James Cauley, said he just kept “throwing it at the board and praying,” but, he recalled, “we couldn’t get on the news to save our ass.” He said, “Chicago media was a tough nut to crack. And I don’t know that we did it that well. Again, we were at 16 percent, and we didn’t move till we went on TV. Then we went on TV and we moved.” But once they started generating more earned media coverage, the publicity gave Obama’s campaign “a certain amount of credibility,” which helped inspire his partisans and helped him pass the “credibility threshold.”56

Showing the voters that an officeholder was working hard in his or her job to bring them tangible benefits was another rationale for trying to gin up much earned media. When Stuart Roy ran Ben Nighthorse Campbell’s 1998 Senate race in Colorado, he welcomed a stream of press releases from Campbell’s Senate office trumpeting Campbell’s efforts on behalf of his constituents.57 The releases offered a blend of policy and targeted messaging. His office announced the grants Campbell had secured, votes he had taken, and bills he had sponsored. Some of the releases were targeted to reporters in Colorado’s Larimer County or western Colorado, where voters were especially affected by the senator’s action. Thus, incumbents running for reelection not only have advantages in raising money but also in generating earned media by official acts that often create positive impressions among the electorate. Campbell’s campaign was able to use his incumbency to figure out what to tell the voters, running on his record of constituent service.

# Using New Media to Make Old-Media News

Casual observers of the 2016 election might be tempted to say that Donald Trump revolutionized campaigning through his use of Twitter and Facebook, and conclude that political campaigns will never be the same again. But very few, if any, candidates—particularly at the state and local level—will be able to replicate Trump’s celebrity news media appeal. Trump’s news media offensive was three-pronged, using both new and old media. First, Trump was able to use his frequent and often controversial tweets to generate news coverage because the news media covered everything he said. Second, whenever Donald Trump made a speaking appearance, cable news broadcast his words live and unfiltered to voters. Finally, as we describe at the beginning of this chapter, Trump made himself available to reporters, and they all wanted to talk to him.

The national media in 2015 and 2016 were _pulled_ to Trump, but, as we’ve shown in this chapter, other campaigns are forced to _push_ their message out to the media. Social media is increasingly influential, but it is important to keep it in perspective; as we show in Figure 9.3]], more voters report reading a newspaper in a single day (32 percent) than say they’ve used Twitter over the past thirty days (14 percent). Campaign managers cannot neglect any old or new media channel as they seek to push their candidate and their message.

![[71.jpeg]]

Figure 9.3 News Media Used by Voters, 2017

**Traditional media channels have higher voter turnout index scores than new media.** For example, look at MSNBC—12 percent of high-turnout voters report watching compared to 9 percent of all adults. (The index is calculated by dividing 12 percent by 9 percent and multiplying by ten.) MSNBC’s index score of 140 means that high-turnout voters are 40 percent more likely to watch the channel when compared to the average adult.

Despite Trump’s breakthrough success at manipulating earned media, free media coverage is a highly imperfect tool that campaign managers approach with a wide array of strategies and media channels—all with the goal of affecting voters’ impressions of the campaign and its issue positions and influencing who turns out and how they decide to vote. It is but one tool in the campaign’s quest to answer the “How do we reach them?” question, although it is increasingly influential in today’s digital media universe. From blunting bad news to winning support from swing voters; from building rapport with the electorate to showing that candidates in fact understand people’s lives; from microtargeting voters in precincts, parishes, towns, or counties, to tying candidates to relevant, popular policies and sharpening distinctions among the candidates, campaign managers employ countless earned media strategies to shape the narrative arc, influence what the media tells voters, and improve their side’s turnout and performance with swing voters. By using free media to communicate their policies and message, they aim to give their side a marginal advantage that will bring them victory. An imprecise art, spinning the news media also helps campaigns answer the question, “What do we tell them?” fueling the behind-the-scenes struggle among campaigns, reporters, bloggers, and other influential voices that often make a meaningful difference on election day.

# Notes

1. Each day, different journalists from the pool assume the principal responsibility of traveling with the candidate (or the president—pool reporting originated with the White House press corps) to write reports for other pool reporters on the details of the day’s activities and statements. Reporters who fly on Air Force One or on a candidate’s chartered campaign plane don’t fly for free. Their news organizations are charged by the White House or the campaign for the equivalent of first-class airfare on a comparable commercial flight and must also pay for hotel accommodations and other costs. Covering presidential campaigns is a major expense for news organizations.

# 10 Field General Waging the War on the Ground

**T**he country was still at war with terrorists from Afghanistan to Yemen and beyond, and the candidate, a president managing multiple crises, had become a divisive figure in the Oval Office. His signature achievement was deeply unpopular, and polls showed that approximately half the electorate approved of the president’s performance; the other half expressed negative opinions, with some of his fiercest critics calling him un-American.

Running for reelection against a well-funded opponent with outside groups funded by hugely wealthy individuals from the world of finance, the president had assembled a team of skilled loyalists to run his race. His strategy was to eschew professional firms and build up a large volunteer grassroots army to contact voters and microtarget messages. Furthermore, the campaign was committed to the use of sophisticated experiments and the latest technology to turn out his core voters and persuade a relatively small number of swing voters to cast their ballots for him.

The election, virtually all polls suggested, was going to be decided by a close margin. The other party had a legitimate shot at victory. Democratic and Republican lawyers were preparing their battle plans if any of the swing states—Ohio or Florida especially—was too close to call on election night.

And then there was the first debate. The incumbent’s campaign manager told us that “the president in the first debate was terrible. There was no, ‘Well, he had this,’ or, ‘Well, he had that,’ or, ‘Well, the press was unfair. The questions were uneven.’ He was very bad in the debate. He came across as a guy who didn’t seem like he ought to be commander in chief, period, end of discussion.”1

Although the first debate unnerved the president’s supporters, the campaign stuck to its plan and was confident in its technological advantages and ground game. They knew that the side that did a better job at motiving their grassroots activists and getting out their vote was likely to win the White House. The victor was probably going to be the one who took advantage of the most modern tool and had developed the superior ground game.

Barack Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012? Well, actually, no. The candidate was George W. Bush, who owned an unpopular war, had middling job approval ratings, and was awful in the first debate—and who, in 2004, used a sophisticated turnout operation to eke out a victory over his Democratic opponent, John Kerry.

Surprised? The Obama campaigns, and 2012 in particular, are legendary for their vaunted mobilization efforts and their ability to expand the American electorate.2 Using a variety of tools, relentless experimentation, and even findings from political scientists,3 the Obama campaign used sophisticated, data-driven get-out-the-vote (GOTV) operations. Still, though phenomenally well done by the Obama team in 2012, such efforts are hardly novel. As the brief vignette just given on the 2004 Bush campaign demonstrates, the science of mobilization was not invented in 2012. Candidates for almost any elective office have always focused on grassroots mobilization as a core activity that can help influence who loses and who wins. Mobilizing voters to go to the polls and cast their ballots for and/or against somebody is still one of the most vital activities in almost any campaign operation.

And in 2004, George W. Bush and his campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, were bent on improving their performance in this department. “In 2000,” as Mehlman told us, “we were crushed when it came to the ground game. Gore did better than we did.”4 Mehlman had no stomach for excuses or rationalizations. He led his team in 2004 to take hard looks at the campaign’s performance each week. And each week, the campaign often said, “‘We lost this week.’ Not, ‘The press was unfair.’ Not, ‘Well, if you look at it this way, we really won it.’”

In 2013, Mehlman said this in an interview with Southern Methodist University:

> There were definitely really big lessons that we learned. I’ve always thought that, in life—and it’s not just in politics; I think about it in business too—what you do wrong is more important than what you do right, in some ways, if you can learn from it. So, often, sustained success can be dangerous, because it can lull you into believing that, in fact, you’re so great, when, in fact, often you’re just fortunate. And similarly, mistakes or things that don’t go as well as you want can be huge opportunities for growth. So if you think about it, we lost the popular vote in 2000, by 500,000 votes. And in the final several days before the election, our numbers went down. And part of that clearly was the DUI revelation. But part of it also, we thought, was we could do a much better job in how we turn out voters. So we came up with a concept we called the seventy-two-hour effort, around the last seventy-two hours of the campaign. And we literally studied every aspect of how you target, how you identify, how you motivate, and how you turn out voters. And we used the 2002 election cycle as a giant laboratory for how we would identify more effective tactics, going forward.5

By 2004, Mehlman had concluded that one key to better turnout was the role of “person-to-person” contact, of neighbors persuading neighbors to vote for Bush and against Kerry. Such personal volunteer contacts would supplant, in part, the campaign’s reliance on paid calls and paid doorknockers from hired canvassers. Learning lessons from mistakes the Bush campaign had made in 2000, he sought more precise targeting of voters in 2004 (using sophisticated data analytics; for more on data in campaigns, see Chapter 3]]) as well as a bigger person-to-person grassroots army.

Refusing to rationalize his side’s disappointing GOTV performance in 2000, Mehlman was determined to target better and find new ways to turn out their voters to carry Bush to a second term. Mehlman and his team developed turnout goals. They conducted “a careful analysis of who the swing voters were” and concluded that Hispanics and suburban women were going to decide the election. “We ended up with a larger level of conservative turnout than we had four years before,” Mehlman explained, “but if you look at what really moved and changed things, it was our ability to win over Hispanics and suburban women. So the increased Republican turnout was also helpful, but if you said to me what did we spend all day, every day thinking about, it was those two audiences.” They had answered the “Who do we need?” question. Now, “How do we reach them?” became their major preoccupation. They had to figure out how to touch them and ensure that they decided to support Bush for reelection.6

Their strategy was to appeal to both groups by contrasting “President Bush’s steadfast leadership at a time of war with Senator Kerry’s changing his position based on the audience, which at a time of war we thought was perilous. That was the argument.” And they would use the argument to reach suburban women and Hispanics and perform marginally better with both groups to influence the vote totals in key states. And the best way to reach and influence such voters was through “word of mouth and person-to-person communication.”7

Mehlman said that anybody who says grassroots organizing is a waste of time is making an “absurd” statement. His 2004 campaign’s GOTV efforts provide a case in point. Bush improved his vote totals among Latinos, winning 39 percent in 2000 and 44 percent in 2004. They motivated evangelical voters to go to the polls in swing states such as Ohio, improving on their 2000 performance, when late news that a much younger Bush had been arrested for drunk driving dampened evangelical turnout. (There’s also some debate about whether evangelicals turned out in higher numbers to vote against same-sex marriage initiatives, which appeared on the ballot in some swing states.) Most importantly, some pollsters said afterward that Bush improved his performance among women voters: In 2000, he lost women to Al Gore by 11 percentage points; in 2004, his deficit among women against Kerry was only 3 percentage points.8

The 2004 voter mobilization plan was based on years of field experiments and hard work by Republican operatives. The Republican National Committee (RNC) 72-Hour Task Force conducted dozens of organizing experiments during 2001 off-year elections, concluding that door knocking could improve voter turnout for their side by 2 to 3 percentage points over, say, stuffing fliers in mailboxes.

The Bush team infused state parties with resources, deployed trained operatives, registered thousands of new Republican voters, and set up GOTV organizations in all of Florida’s sixty-seven counties, to cite one example.9 On election day, Mehlman’s team had 85,000 GOTV volunteers, and their job was to talk to voters and ensure that voters turned up and voted for Bush. They held house parties, made phone calls, and talked to their neighbors. The campaign’s message stressed socially conservative values—anti-same-sex marriage, anti-abortion, pro-religion—and Bush’s strong wartime leadership, and their messages resonated with rural voters especially. In Ohio, the key swing state that year, Bush was able to match his 2000 performance in the state’s urban areas, and at the same time, he improved his share of the vote in Ohio’s rural communities. “Compared with 2000, his vote totals and margins of victory soared all across Ohio’s Appalachian southeast and its southern and western farm belt,” the _Washington Post_ reported shortly after election day. In Ohio, Bush defeated Kerry by just over 200,000 votes. And Bush’s win in Ohio carried him to victory in the Electoral College, handing him a second term.10

All of these smallish differences added up to victory on election day. Mehlman’s mobilization plan was executed, and it worked well.

The 2004 case raises a larger point: Voter mobilization, also known as GOTV and voter canvassing, raises a core concern among political scientists and political professionals alike. What motivates people to cast their ballots? Why do they decide to vote for one candidate or, oftentimes, against another candidate? What’s clear is that voting is a two-step process—deciding to vote is the first step; deciding for whom to vote is the second. Campaigns are about maximizing the turnout of those who will vote for you but may not vote and about maximizing the loyalty of those who are sure to vote but may vote for the other person. On Bush’s campaign, Mehlman’s goal was to maximize the turnout of evangelicals, who fit into the former category, and maximize the loyalty of Latinos and women—two groups that Mehlman saw as the most pliable within an already fairly stable electorate. Mehlman told us that he used polls to learn “where the public is, their attitudes toward your candidate, their attitudes toward the other, what they think [about which] issues are important, what motivates them.”11

As Mehlman admitted, Obama built on Bush’s voter mobilization innovations and elevated them to a new level of sophistication and effectiveness. And Bush, for his part, had been inspired by Howard Dean’s voter mobilization activities during the 2004 Democratic primary. Mehlman was impressed with Dean’s use of “netroots” to build his campaign network and mobilize his supporters.12 He called Dean’s use of “social media, meet-ups, to mobilize people . . . a very smart move” and said he learned from Dean “about . . . the power of neighbor mobilizing and influencing neighbor. And we tried to adopt similar tactics in our effort.”13

Yet, although Bush, Obama, and other campaigns have used new technologies and more sophisticated measures of their return on investment to gauge their mobilization progress, campaigns have always been targeted. Voter mobilization is as old as elections. Yet, in recent years, pundits, political pros, and analysts have all fallen in love with mobilization and grassroots-fueled campaigns, as if the ground game is a shiny new object that campaigns must collect and cash in. But Dean, Bush, and Obama were hardly the first campaigns to target, and political scientists conducting experiments at Yale about mobilization activities were not the first people to experiment.

Grassroots activism—battle for victory in the ground game—has a stubborn romantic quality surrounding it. Voter mobilization is often associated with the power of thousands of volunteer-activists who are impassioned for their candidate and the larger cause and who work their guts out to realize their collective vision of reform and national rejuvenation. And by harnessing the power of a movement fueled by grassroots ardor, campaign leaders can lead their army to decisive victory at the polls, bending history toward justice and equality.

# How Do We Reach Them?

This version of voter mobilization isn’t entirely fiction. Grassroots activism and targeting voters has a long history. In 1960, Matt Reese set up a voter mobilization headquarters in the basement of Charleston, West Virginia’s, Kanawha Hotel, spending eighteen hours a day calling voters to ask them to vote for John F. Kennedy in the state’s Democratic primary.14 As the chief organizer of JFK’s volunteer operation, Reese helped ensure that Kennedy’s supporters voted, giving the candidate a crucial win that propelled him to his party’s presidential nomination.

At 350 pounds and 6’5”, Reese, a native of West Virginia, spoke with an earthy drawl that hid the pioneering nature of his work in targeting voters on political campaigns. He preferred to target two types of people: voters who were likely to vote for his candidate but weren’t sure if they’d actually vote and voters open to arguments for his candidate or against his candidate’s opponent. The _Washington Post_ once quoted him as saying that he told his field operatives, “If you want to pick cherries, go where the cherries is.”15 Reese helped pioneer and refine the process of voter targeting and canvassing, using demographic data, polls, and other voter information to target particular groups of voters with particular messages that were likely to convince them to go to the polls or to vote for or against a particular candidate.16

Decades prior to Reese’s innovations, the leader of Tammany Hall, George Washington Plunkitt, refined the art of constituent service and voter mobilization among urban machines. He targeted Italians, Irish Catholics, Russian Jews, and other recent immigrants. Meeting with people in his district to find out what they needed from the machine, he built his power by ensuring strong voter turnout and loyalty to Tammany Hall. “And turnout was a function of relentless outreach and tireless service,” historian Terry Golway has written.17

Other, more recent examples underscore the degree to which grassroots organizing can power even presidential campaigns. Barry Goldwater’s 1964 White House run enjoyed strong support from conservative activists in such groups as Young Americans for Freedom, and such activists ultimately helped put Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office in 1980. Barack Obama drew thousands of mostly youthful volunteers who rallied behind his call to change politics and restore hope to the broken political process. The idea of grassroots movements (e.g., Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street) sparking and propelling reform causes and candidates has a hallowed spot in American political history. The media depict the ground game as, at once, the most prosaic and exhilarating aspect of political campaigning. Volunteers, young and old and living on adrenaline, pizza, and booze, are portrayed as sacrificing their careers and family to make America better.

The narrative isn’t totally off base. Field organizing and grassroots activism often are grueling, romantic, and impactful; many campaign managers interviewed in this book got their start as grassroots organizers and were inspired to stay in politics by these early experiences. Canvassing taught them invaluable lessons, too. California campaign manager and former grassroots organizer Katie Merrill told us, in fact, that no moment in politics trumps the thrill of a winning campaign that successfully mobilized its grassroots activists. “When you’re running a race . . . and you meet the contact goals and you meet your ID goals and you meet your turnout goals and win, it’s about the coolest thing in the world,” she explained.18 Campaign managers argued that their grassroots experience unveiled for them how and why voters are persuaded to go to the polls and vote for a certain candidate.

Trump’s 2016 campaign not only was able to flip some Obama voters, especially in the Midwest, to Trump voters; it also generated a bigger-than-anticipated turnout among white rural and working-class voters that helped him to win traditionally Democratic states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. At the same time, if Hillary Clinton’s campaign had managed to energize African American voters in midwestern states to match Obama’s record 2008 and 2012 turnouts, she might well have won the White House.19 In fact, one of the biggest mistakes of the Clinton campaign may just have been the assumption that she would be able to replicate the voter enthusiasm generated by the first major black presidential candidate and the first black president.

Political scientists have arrived at a long-standing, rough consensus on the importance and impact of voter mobilization in political campaigns. In fact, seventy years before political scientists rediscovered the power of experiments and applied them to voter mobilization, Harold Gosnell, in Chicago, ran some of the first field experiments to measure the impact of voter mobilization on political campaigns. Direct voter contact, he showed then, led to an increase in political participation. Since then, political scientists have consistently demonstrated that direct voter contact (direct mail, door knocking, and phone banking in more recent times) can improve one side’s share and performance and influence who votes and whom they decide to vote for and/or vote against. As one of us pointed out in another article, “The vast majority of [academic] studies . . . show that people who are contacted by parties, campaigns, or interest groups are more likely to participate in politics than those who are not.”20

The decades of findings from the political science literature resonated with the professionals’ experiences in running campaigns regardless of the political office. To build winning coalitions and affect election results, campaign managers routinely told us, their field operations—nowadays informed and driven by high-tech tools such as electronic voter lists detailing individuals’ preferences and interests—were essential elements in reaching 50 plus 1 percent of the vote.

Grassroots experience is therefore important to the operatives who run campaigns and devise campaign strategies. But what does voter mobilization even entail? How should we define it? How do campaign managers view its role and importance in winning and losing elections?

Political canvassing is best understood as any activity that induces voters to go to the polls and cast their ballots for or against a particular candidate. Again, it’s a two-step process—getting people to vote and getting them to vote for or against someone or something. This process involves the first three questions from Figure 1.2]] (see Chapter 1]]): Who are our target voters? How do we reach them? And, to a lesser degree, What do we tell them? Campaign managers understand that civic-minded appeals to voters aren’t enough to get people to vote. The ground game, they know, is about trying to increase the perceived benefits or lower the costs to people who are likely to vote. Either campaigns use mechanics to make it easier for people to vote—registering voters, reminding them about election day, driving them to the polls, sending them absentee ballots; make it seem like there’s a cost if they were to avoid voting—making them feel guilty about not voting; or make people see that there’s a benefit to them by casting their ballots. Whether campaign managers employ mechanics or messages (or both), all of them are trying to play with this roughly similar turnout equation.

Political mobilization includes both the mechanics of voter contact and messaging, according to campaign managers surveyed here. So mobilization should be seen in broader terms than most scholars typically see it—not only as door knocks, direct mail, and phone banking but also as the messages campaigns target to discreet blocs of voters. In other words, the messages campaigns send motivate citizens to participate in the political process, and communications should be seen as synonymous with political canvassing and GOTV activities. Arguably, Trump’s antiestablishment, anti-immigrant, anti-free-trade message, and reality TV campaign show mobilized his partisans to turn out more than any Republican-orchestrated GOTV campaign in the final days of the 2016 election.

In Chapters 7]], [^8], and [^9], we covered the role, delivery, and effects of messaging on campaigns and elections. Although we devote less time in Chapter 10]] to analyzing message as a mobilization tool, it’s important to remember that GOTV activities do not occur in a political vacuum. Campaigns must wrestle with such forces as competing messages from their opponents (What are they doing?), a political climate shaped by fundamentals (economic, party ID, demographic), available information about persuadable voters, and what outside groups are communicating over the airwaves without technically coordinating with the campaigns themselves.

Thus, voter mobilization is only one among a number of factors that can and do influence vote totals. But there is widespread agreement that direct voter contact has a positive impact on who turns out and for whom they vote. Remember that campaign managers are ultimately seeking to influence share (turnout) and performance (persuasion) to favor their candidate at the margins (see Chapter 2]]); so the messages campaigns communicate, the voters they target, and the grassroots activities they harvest are proven methods for affecting who votes and for whom on the margins. And as we never get tired of saying in this book, the margins can determine who controls Congress, who sits in the Oval Office, or which party controls a statehouse.

# The Two-Step Process: Deciding to Vote and Voting for or against a Candidate

Voter mobilization is not a one-size-fits-all activity, of course. Just as campaign messages differ based on content, delivery, and volume, mobilization includes volunteers knocking on people’s doors, neighborhood block parties, snail mail landing on voters’ doorsteps, phone banking, and targeting particular blocs of voters with particular messages. In the 2017 Virginia governor’s race and Alabama’s special election for US Senate, President Trump sought to mobilize core Republican voters in each state by using Twitter to bash the Democrats in those races as weak on crime and immigration21, 22 whereas Democrats focused massive efforts on getting nonwhite voters to the polls. One ad aired in Virginia showed a white man in a pickup truck chasing down young Hispanic kids. But which of these activities is most effective? Which is least helpful? Is it better to focus campaign efforts on the mechanics of getting people to the polls or, rather, providing them with a compelling message to vote for or against a particular person? The best answer we can give is, it depends. _Field_ means different things depending on the kind of campaign that’s being run, where it’s occurring, and the type of strategy the campaign is using. Democratic campaign manager Ashley Spillane argued that “in Washington state that’s 100 percent vote by mail, you can’t run the traditional seventy-two-hour GOTV campaign. You have to understand each state’s voting process to mount an effective political campaign.”23

More generally, a well-organized ground game can provide a boost to long-shot candidates and aid campaigns trailing their opponents in funds raised or ads aired. It can be especially valuable in low-turnout primaries. An army of volunteers attending rallies, knocking on doors, and posting on social media can provide campaigns with much-needed earned media, raise funds from small donors, and help turn out voters on election day. Campaign manager Mark Block, who ran Herman Cain’s unorthodox 2012 presidential primary campaign, helped Cain leap to the front of the pack by forging what he called “a nontraditional campaign” powered by a “grassroots citizens’ movement” based on the Tea Party.24 Block’s vision was to run a bottom-up campaign. Indeed, although Cain ultimately was defeated, he briefly became a front-runner for the nomination. Cain’s short-lived ascendance in some respects can be seen as forecasting Trump’s 2016 White House run. And more broadly, the Tea Party (albeit often backed by donors with deep pockets) has become a grassroots force in low-turnout Republican primary campaigns to unseat numerous incumbents seen as insufficiently conservative, including former House majority leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) and longtime senator Richard Lugar (R-IN). This insurgency also helped secure the Republican nomination for Trump in a 2016 primary field crowded with “establishment” GOP officeholders.

Still, most campaign managers see robocalls, for example, as less effective than neighbors persuading neighbors to go to the polls and vote for their chosen candidate. And although Twitter and Facebook are increasingly used to persuade online networks of voters to volunteer for campaigns and vote on election day, social media GOTV activities are highly unlikely to ever completely replace more traditional voter outreach. Person-to-person contact, managers tend to say, matters more than impersonal mobilization techniques. And the timing is not inconsequential. Some managers told us that doing a direct mailing to voters early in a campaign was more beneficial to their candidate than bombarding voters with literature in the campaign’s final days, when voters are typically sick of the campaign and more likely to ignore any campaign communications. Some political scientists have argued that person-to-person contact is more effective than phone calls and direct mailings, although the evidence in support of this is iffy.25 At the same time, scholars have paid too little attention to the role of communications in mobilization—and we argue that message and direct voter contact together should be seen as key elements in any mobilization strategy. A hyperorganized, well-funded ground game that lacks a persuasive, engaging message is more likely than not going to lose; a case in point is Hillary Clinton’s supercharged data operations and GOTV efforts in 2016. As pollster Mark Mellman said, “While organization is vitally important, it is not sufficient. . . . When a campaign claims they are going to win on turnout, they will likely lose.”26 All the organization and mobilization in the world may not make a decisive difference if the campaign lacks a cohesive message that penetrates the targeted voters.

# “Old-Fashioned Grunt Work”

We’ve seen that there’s no pure formula dictating to campaign managers how they must use the tools available to them to win elections. Campaign managers must identify a winning coalition, build the campaign’s infrastructure, raise the right amount of money to conduct campaign activities, develop the right messages, and ensure they reach the right voters at the right moments. Put differently, there simply is no grassroots magic—waves of volunteers appearing out of the blue—that can automatically propel a candidate to a House or Senate seat or even into the Oval Office.

At the same time, campaign managers know that ineffective ground games can put them at a real disadvantage on the electoral margins. They must decide how they are going to recruit and use their volunteers and turn out their voters on election day in the most efficient way possible. Looked at another way, they all need some kind of “field” strategy that can help tilt a tight election in their favor during the course of the contest. A sophisticated field strategy integrates organizing, funding, targeting, and messaging in the hopes of maximizing one side’s share of the vote and persuading as many undecided voters as possible. Field activities also help to answer three of the key questions you saw on the campaign flowchart featured in Chapter 1]]: How do we reach them? What do we tell them? How are we doing?

And indeed, virtually all of the managers we talked to saw field as an important element in their overall toolkit—even in the age of digital communications. Author Sasha Issenberg told us that direct voter contact remained a central element to contemporary campaigning and now rests firmly on “a high-tech foundation.” “The big thing that’s happened in the last fifteen years in politics is that we’ve gotten a whole lot smarter about how to knock on doors and have volunteers make phone calls,” he argued. Although campaign managers don’t necessarily know with any precision what impact televised advertisements have on who votes and how they vote, “we do know that there’s something that happens when a volunteer knocks on the door of somebody in their neighborhood and has a well-trained, well-structured interaction.”27 Even in the age of the Internet, Issenberg observed the following:

> The most targetable, controlled interactions in politics are at the doorstep or at the mailbox. You know who you’re talking to. You know if you got to them or not. And for all the advantages of broadcast or online communications, and there are wonderful media for all sorts of things, you don’t have that. You don’t have that level of precision, specificity, accountability.28
> 
> The impact of political canvassing is quantifiable to many campaign managers. Matt McDonald, who served as deputy campaign manager for Elia Pirozzi’s 1998 congressional campaign and has taught in campaign schools, said that any effective grassroots plan should aim to “turn out about 10 percent of their entire vote goal.” During a campaign’s GOTV push, he added, the campaign must figuratively “drive 10 percent of everything they need to the ballot. And all of the grassroots work that they do before that needs to prepare and build toward that goal.” He has taken to invoking his mantra that “all grassroots is GOTV”—ensuring that months of organizing pays off on election day. Echoing our argument that campaign activities can be decisive on the margins, McDonald argued that with each side highly motivated, “the only way that you can win [close elections] is by having a ton of organization. And if you don’t have that, then you probably lose.” He estimated that campaigns had some degree of control over “10 to 15 percent of the final outcome” by implementing “a strong grassroots operation.”29

Democrats Todd Schulte and Joe Abbey, for their part, estimated that an effective ground game should account for around 2 percent of the overall vote. That’s a meager percentage at first blush. But let’s remember that campaign managers running competitive races are trying to gain every edge to affect the vote totals. Again, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, the margins matter. Schulte did the math for us.

> I think it’s important to filter down past the idea . . . that campaigns should be about moving huge portions of the electorate. They’re not. I think that field is really important, but field has never been shown, even in super-low-turnout special elections in the middle of winter, to move more than 5 to 6 percent of the vote. But that’s a huge amount if 20 percent of the electorate’s the only part that’s up for grabs. Most of the time, field is 2 percent, which again is 10 percent of your votes that’s up for grabs.30

Now let’s recall Joe Abbey’s decision in Creigh Deeds’s primary campaign (see Chapter 4]]) to fire his field organizers and pour all of the campaign’s resources into television advertising. Does Abbey’s decision mean that field didn’t matter to Deeds’s campaign? Hardly. Abbey was making a strategic call that field, as he put it, would get him perhaps 2 percent of the vote, but in a low-turnout primary where Deeds had low name identification, television could move as much as 15 percent of the primary vote. Abbey’s gamble, as we now know, was successful.31 The television blitz helped Deeds pull off a come-from-behind victory to secure the Democratic nomination. But that, too, was a form of mobilization—mobilizing voters and persuading voters to support Deeds’s bid over the airwaves.

Most managers we surveyed said that voter mobilization constituted a core element of any winning campaign plan they made. Republican Graham Shafer told us that campaigns are only in position to catch an election year wave if “they’ve raised enough money to deliver their message” and “found enough volunteers and activists to . . . generate momentum on a grassroots level.”32 Mobilization and message, broadly defined, are lynchpins of many successful campaigns. Another campaign manager said that a good field campaign can absolutely move the needle for a candidate and help the campaign assemble a winning coalition.33

Republican Steve Bell, who ran Heather Wilson’s 1998 congressional race in New Mexico, described campaigns now as little changed from campaigns run in the early nineteenth century. Campaigns need to identify every person who is going to vote for their side and ensure that the person casts a ballot. “Not much has changed,” he said. The core questions he always asks when managing a campaign include “What forms the winning coalition? How do we put that coalition together? What theme or two themes, because you can never do more than really two or three themes, what puts those people together? And how can we best reach them?” He added another key question: “How do you make sure they show up?” He stressed that campaigns had to methodically identify their voters “one by one. . . . Where they live, what their zip codes are” and undertake “old-fashioned grunt work” of knocking on doors and delivering fliers in order to assemble their winning coalition.34

Campaign managers also seek to mobilize important activist groups on their behalf because they can bring foot soldiers to the campaign and reach voters who are likely to support the candidate and help get them to the polls. Bell reported that the endorsement of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and New Mexico’s anti-abortion groups established Wilson as a true conservative in the 1998 Republican primary.35 Bell’s team also used voter lists to target and mobilize people who typically voted in Republican primaries.36 Adam Bodily, Duane Snow’s deputy campaign manager in his race for county supervisor in 2009, described how the Albemarle County GOP gave his campaign “walking lists . . . worth their weight in gold.”37 The lists enabled them to identify, reach, and mobilize strong and weak Republican voters.

But why haven’t e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter replaced person-to-person voter contact and mobilization activities? These tools tend to be useful, among other things, for communicating with, motivating, and raising funds from already devout activists who will support the campaign no matter what. Matthew Arnold, who ran Darcy Burner’s (D-WA) 2012 congressional campaign, argued that e-mails sent by campaigns were highly effective at talking to the party’s activists.38 On a ten-point scale, he rated e-mail a six as a useful motivation tool.39 But to turn out a larger percentage of one’s potential voters, to register new voters, to persuade undecided voters, and to ensure people actually cast a ballot, tools such as e-mail and social media were of far more limited value. One unanswered question is whether Trump’s brazen use of Twitter to hug his allies and bash his foes illustrates how in at least some rare cases, a politician with a wildly popular Twitter feed can activate a subset of voters to volunteer their time and actually vote on election day.

Regardless, campaigns, for all the advances in technological wizardry, still need door knocking and phone banking programs. Direct mail still matters, too. According to some managers we interviewed, these GOTV activities have become even more vital because digital tools and electronic information enable much more precise targeting of the electorate. In other words, it’s easier for campaigns to target voters with particular messages using old-fashioned methods (e.g., door knocks, direct mail). Mitch McConnell’s 1990 Senate campaign manager, Steven Law, argued that retail politics—person-to-person contact aimed at persuading swing voters and mobilizing one’s partisans—“enjoyed a renaissance during the Bush years with the emphasis on microtargeting techniques and organized door-to-door” contact.40 Technology offers campaigns a wider array of tools to answer the “How do we reach them?” question, however, and it can fuel a GOTV grassroots plan by making targeting and contacts more refined and effective.

Katie Merrill, who started as a field organizer and later became a California media and campaign strategist, underscored this irony. As she entered California politics in 1992, people warned her that “field is dead.” They added, “It’s all about TV.” That prediction turned out to be wrong. Merrill told us that, in fact, “field has made a comeback and it’s making a comeback because of the Internet. It’s just easier to organize, much easier to call, much easier to recruit volunteers, actually get them to do things for the campaign”—activities that help the campaign turn out its voters and persuade swing voters and affect the race’s margins on election day. The Internet, she concluded, has made grassroots organizing and GOTV efforts less labor intensive and “more cost effective.”41

As we have argued in this book, the campaign’s goal is to move the electorate at the margins in the hopes of securing a relatively small percentage of the vote for its side by persuading voters and turning out loyal partisans. Campaigns are about simple math, share and performance, and all the data-tracking, microtargeting, information-mining tools used by campaigns now still need to be used effectively to reach, persuade, and mobilize the right voters. In 2008, campaign manager Julie Petrick was running Democrat Gary Peters’s congressional campaign in the Detroit, Michigan, suburbs. Her goal was to make sure that Democrats “voted down the ballot for our candidate” in a presidential year with expected high Democratic turnout and Obama on the ballot.42

Grassroots figured prominently in her strategy. Like Merrill, Petrick believes in the impact of field operations partly because she started out in politics by doing voter mobilization on campaigns. “That was the best training I ever got,” she assured us. She learned the most about campaigns “by working on campaigns [at the grassroots level] . . . and by working for some awesome, talented managers.” A Florida native, Petrick worked on two races for student body president at the University of Florida and later learned the nuts and bolts of campaigning as a grassroots organizer on John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign and as field director on Representative Ron Klein’s (D-FL) 2006 congressional campaign.43

In 2008 as Peters’s campaign manager, she mounted “a really aggressive direct voter targeting program on both the paid and volunteer sides.”44 The effort was sophisticated and effective. Petrick launched her GOTV operation months ahead of election day. Drawing on the Voter Activation Network (VAN) (which contained a trove of data on voters from Michigan’s secretary of state’s office), Petrick’s team began to identify voter targets for the campaign’s mobilization efforts. They focused on Democratic voters because Peters was facing an uphill battle with an entrenched Republican incumbent. Although he had been a state senator and barely lost a statewide race for attorney general (the margin was 5,200 votes)45 and enjoyed decent name recognition among Democratic voters, he was also squaring off against a sixteen-year GOP incumbent with deep ties to the district. Thus, Petrick focused their grassroots campaign on reaching persuadable, largely Democratic voters. After compiling lists of their voter targets, Petrick launched a door-knocking program in March that continued right on through to election day. Ultimately, Peters defeated his Republican opponent, Representative Joe Knollenberg, by a healthy margin—52 to 43 percent. He had the advantage of running in a blue state in a great year for Democrats when Obama was on the ballot nationwide. McCain, Obama’s opponent, had also abandoned the state in the campaign’s final weeks, giving Democrats a wider opening. And although Petrick’s field program did not alone bring Peters victory, it helped him overcome some of the disadvantages any challenger facing an eight-term incumbent must surmount. Peters is now a US senator, the only freshman Democrat in the 2015 Senate class.

On both the left and right of the spectrum, campaign managers argued, voter mobilization (including person-to-person contact and targeted communications) was still a highly effective means of improving a candidate’s shot at victory. Graham Shafer, Van Hilleary’s (R-TN) 2002 gubernatorial campaign manager, told us that a venerable test of a campaign’s viability is “whether they’ve found enough volunteers and activists to . . . generate momentum on a grassroots level.”46 Even on a presidential campaign, a grassroots plan implemented effectively can make a big impact. During the 2008 Republican presidential Iowa caucuses, Mitt Romney’s team was looking to make their candidate a front-runner for the nomination.

The way to do that, they concluded, was to perform well in Iowa. Romney’s Iowa campaign manager Gentry Collins helped craft a particular kind of grassroots strategy: By winning the Ames Straw Poll held many months before the caucuses, Romney, Collins reasoned, would generate the kind of earned media and political momentum that would help him perform well at the caucuses themselves. Collins figured this:

> If we overperformed at Ames, that would put us up on the stage along with the front-runners for the entire period of time between August and January. . . . So we set about to do that on a tactical level, meaning, you know, 99 counties in Iowa, you need that county chair not only advocating for you and hosting events for you so people can get to know you as a candidate, but then specifically asking people not just to be a supporter or write a check or vote for you next January, but to get on a bus, . . . go to Ames, participate in the straw poll, vote for Governor Romney.47

Collins had two tasks: He had to recruit enough strong Romney supporters in Iowa who would be persuaded to back Romney and take a bus to Ames and cast their ballot for Romney, and he had to build the infrastructure “into which we could push those [supporters].”48 He had to achieve both things simultaneously. Collins’s faith in his strategy wasn’t misplaced. Romney won the straw poll. Ultimately, although he lost the caucuses and the presidential nomination (Mike Huckabee won the former and John McCain the latter), he took second place on caucus night, making himself a leading candidate for the nomination, forcing his chief rivals to reckon more fully with him as a front-runner in the Republican primary.

If campaigns are about reaching targeted voters with the right messages delivered by persuasive messengers, they are also about persuading voters to volunteer for the campaign, cast ballots on election day, and vote for a particular candidate. The greater the number of grassroots supporters on a campaign, the more tied they are to the district or state, and the more passion they have, the more likely it is that a campaign will reap electoral benefits on the margins. They can field the shock troops enabling them to flush its vote on election day, persuade undecided voters to support the campaign, and eke out a victory in a close contest.

Campaign managers must ask the core questions as they make their voter mobilization plans: Who do we target? How do we reach them? What do we tell them? Field operations amount to direct voter contacts and the messages behind these contacts that enable campaigns to ensure that their core supporters indeed are solidly behind the candidate and will go to the polls. If voters say they are 100 percent for Jane Smith, but they have no way of getting to their polling station, the campaign can provide a car or bus to take them to the polls. If a voter isn’t sure about whether she supports Jane Smith, the campaign’s field person can do her best to deliver the message that’s hopefully going to persuade this voter to cast a ballot for Smith. Indeed, field matters not only because it can affect the vote totals on the margins; it matters because many campaign managers got their start as grassroots volunteers and field organizers.

Voter mobilization is exhilarating, exhausting, and often consequential work. Knocking on people’s doors and calling them on their phones to try to make sure they are supporting your side requires stamina, discipline, resources, training, and endless planning. But it is at the grassroots where campaigns are sometimes lost and won. Voter mobilization can provide campaigns with earned media, help campaign managers glean information from the field and thereby assess their progress, motivate partisans, persuade the persuadable, raise funds for other campaign activities, and influence the vote total at the margins—making the difference between losing and winning.

# 11 Strategy Enforcer Keeping a Day-to-Day Focus on the Long-Term Path to Victory

**P**olitical campaigns are full of daily distractions punctuated by actual crises. These episodes can make it hard for managers to keep a campaign focused on its long-term strategy for winning. Few campaign managers have faced more distractions and crises than James Carville did while running the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign from their national headquarters in Little Rock, just a few blocks from the Arkansas governor’s mansion where Bill Clinton lived when he wasn’t on the presidential campaign trail. Decisions about the location of a presidential campaign headquarters are a mix of logistics and political symbolism. For 1992 Democratic presidential challenger and Arkansas governor Clinton, who was running against Washington establishmentarian and incumbent Republican president George H. W. Bush, his Little Rock campaign headquarters symbolized Clinton’s positioning as a Washington outsider. Meanwhile, for logistical reasons, President Bush’s 1992 reelection campaign was headquartered in downtown Washington near the White House.

Although some Clinton-Gore staffers from “up north” took a while to adjust to the slow-paced Arkansas capital city, Carville found himself close to home. An unabashed Southerner and LSU football fan, James Carville grew up in a political household in tiny Carville, Louisiana, just north of Baton Rouge near the Mississippi River.1 Like other southern hamlets, the town of Carville was named for a postmaster, who, in this case, happened to be James’s grandfather, Louis Arthur Carville.2 To this day, Carville’s favorite TV program remains _The Andy Griffith Show_, a 1960s sitcom about the elected sheriff of a small southern town.3

Politics started early for Carville. “It was just always a topic of conversation at my house. I never remember not talking or hearing about politics,” said Carville, who started out as a teenage campaign volunteer in local campaigns before he was old enough to get his driver’s license. “Candidates used to do signs on telephone poles back then,” he remembered. “I was tearing the other guys’ signs down,” said Carville, who is still known for his aggressive political style. At LSU, Carville got involved in the Young Democrats, then did a stint in the Marines (a fact that has been rarely reported since Carville became a political celebrity) before heading to law school.4

Carville found a job at a Baton Rouge political consulting firm doing local races. When his candidate won the mayor’s office, Carville worked in city hall for about a year and a half before deciding that being on the municipal government payroll wasn’t for him.5 “I had three choices: to go crazy, go to jail, or go somewhere else.”6 When Carville was back into electoral politics pollster Peter Hart helped him get a job in a Virginia campaign, and Carville started working in a series of races that would culminate in the 1992 Clinton White House victory.

Carville was thirty-three years old before he ever visited Washington or New York. Even more surprising, although he had been involved in campaigns since receiving his driver’s license, he didn’t win his first race until 1986 at the age of forty-two.7 In fact, he chalked up a lengthy losing streak that would have persuaded less hardy souls to find a different profession. Carville’s luck changed when he signed on to manage Democrat Robert Casey’s gubernatorial race in Pennsylvania (for more on that campaign, see Chapter 8]]).8 In April 1991, Pennsylvania’s senior US senator, H. John Heinz III, died in a plane accident, and Carville managed Harris Wofford’s bid for the open seat against Dick Thornburgh, the former Pennsylvania governor and US attorney general.9 Early polls showed Wofford trailing Thornburgh by almost 40 points.10 Yet, improbably, Wofford won the election in a victory that brought Carville and his partner Paul Begala to national prominence. Carville went on from there to manage Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign. He brought with him some of the lessons he had learned on those earlier races. He concluded that the manager had to enforce the campaign’s strategy and build a campaign culture that could enact the strategy effectively. He envisioned a unified set of campaign hands all pushing in the same direction toward their shared goal of winning.

# Clinton-Gore 1992: “The Best Campaign Ever”

Under Carville’s leadership, Clinton’s 1992 effort came to be seen as the next step in the evolution of modern electioneering. A team of documentary filmmakers camped out in the Little Rock headquarters and produced a film that starred not the candidate but Carville and his campaign staffers.11 The news media was attracted to youngish Clinton personalities like Carville and his communications director George Stephanopoulos, who discovered that they could make news themselves by changing the way campaigns were run.12

Carville’s 1992 campaign innovations were destined to become staples of today’s campaigns including the rapid-response “war room,” the candidate family bus tour, and presidential candidate appearances on late-night talk shows, which were previously regarded as unpresidential. “It was the most culturally significant political campaign in modern American history,” claimed Carville, with typical exaggeration.13

The most lasting of their innovations was the Little Rock war room, where young press operatives constantly talked to reporters, monitored news coverage—which was much more difficult in pre-Internet 1992—and crafted rapid response statements to shape breaking news coverage for Clinton’s benefit. The Clinton war room was born out of necessity. From the beginning, the Clinton campaign was bombarded with attacks—first by his Democratic primary opponents and then by Republicans. The war room fended off stories about Bill Clinton’s escape from the Vietnam draft and travels to Moscow as well as charges about Hillary’s business dealings as a Little Rock lawyer. Most potentially damaging were news accounts of the married Bill Clinton’s past relationships with women, and allegations of sexual harassment. One Republican operative derisively branded these stories as “bimbo eruptions,” and the irresistible combination of sex and politics drew heavy media attention.14 Carville’s campaign staff was getting distracted and in danger of spending too much time fighting the eruptions and not enough time playing offense.

# Keeping the Campaign Team on Strategy

It is not easy to unseat an incumbent president. To win, the Clinton campaign targeted “Reagan Democrats” and independents who voted for Bush in 1988 but had become disenchanted with the lackluster economic conditions of 1992. The core message was summed up by Senator Al Gore, vice presidential nominee, at the Democrats’ New York City convention:

> Unemployment around the country has gone up; the number of jobs has gone down. The trade deficit has gone up; personal income has gone down. The budget deficit has gone up; consumer confidence has gone down. Poverty has gone up; the number of jobs has gone down. Bankruptcies have gone up, jobs, down; fear, up; hope, down; everything that oughta be down is up, everything that should be up is down; they’ve got it upside down, and we’re gonna turn it right side up!15

To remind staffers that their core message was more important than Clinton’s sex scandals and other disruptive crises, Carville began posting what Stephanopoulos called “campaign haikus” on walls and whiteboards.16 One of these, “It’s the economy, stupid,” became not only the driving management directive inside Clinton-Gore campaign headquarters across the country but was also repeated outside the campaign by news reporters in their stories about the highly disciplined Clinton team.

Carville said that the strategy exists to be shared with the staff that will then go on to implement it. “I want everyone [in the campaign] to know what the strategy is. It’s not a fricking secret. I really want everyone to understand exactly what it is that we’re up to,” said Carville.17 He added that many campaigns fail to build an effective mission-driven culture because they keep too many secrets and physically silo campaign staffers off from one another.18 Carville is a big believer in having an open floor plan at a campaign headquarters and said that an abandoned high school gym would be an ideal location.19 “I’ve heard of campaigns, they want one floor for the managers and another floor is the fundraising and another floor is the research and another floor is this, everything else. You know what I mean? You should be able to walk around and say, ‘Hey, what’s going on here?’” Carville doesn’t like paper shredders and closed doors. “If anybody has anything, just ask me.”

According to Carville, the number one organizational enemy of campaigns is meetings: “Discourage meetings . . . discourage meetings at all costs.”20

Carville’s approach to integrating strategy and team building (for more on the latter, see Chapter 5]]) is highlighted in a scene late in the documentary _The War Room_. The Little Rock campaign staff is gathered on election eve, and Stephanopoulos is introducing Carville:

Stephanopoulos:  And finally, before I give him the floor for what I hope isn’t the last time. I think we all know that, besides Bill Clinton, one person really gave this campaign focus. And one person wrote what I call a haiku [scattered laughter] about five months ago: “Change versus more of the same. The economy, stupid.” I think if you did a Nexis, it would come up in about a thousand places.  
 I was kidding James yesterday. I said he was about to pass from a role of regular human being into the role of a legend [chuckling]. And I think he really deserves it . . . because probably for the first time in a generation tomorrow we’re gonna win. And that means that more people are gonna have better jobs. People are gonna pay a little less for health care, get better care . . . and more kids are gonna go to better schools.

[Cheering]

Carville:  There’s a simple doctrine. Outside of a person’s love, the most sacred thing that they can give is their labor. And somehow or another along the way, we tend to forget that. And labor is a very precious thing that you have. And any time that you can combine labor with love . . . you’ve made a merger. And I think we’re gonna win tomorrow . . . and I think that the governor is gonna fulfill his promise and change America . . . and I think many of you are gonna go on and help him.  
 I’m a political professional. That’s what I do for a living. I’m proud of it. We changed the way campaigns are run.21

Clinton went on to win 43 percent of the popular vote, George H. W. Bush took 37 percent, and independent billionaire candidate Ross Perot garnered 19 percent of the popular vote. Carville helped Clinton achieve victory by executing the campaign’s core strategies and infusing his team with a shared sense of mission. Clinton became the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter to win the presidency. One reason that happened was because Carville played his role as strategy enforcer with moxie, instinct, and an even keel. The Clinton campaign withstood scandal after scandal and kept on its winning course, partly because Carville kept the candidate focused and established a culture that persuaded all staff to feel invested in the strategy.

# Inheriting a Team, Executing a Strategy

Carville and his team built the 1992 Clinton strategy and campaign infrastructure from scratch and had the time to make sure that their strategy and their people were in sync. Not every campaign manager has that luxury. In the worst case, a replacement manager is parachuted into an ongoing campaign—usually one that’s in trouble—and charged with turning it around. Not only does the new manager have to evaluate the campaign’s strategy, but he or she must also assess and take charge of the campaign staff and volunteers. And do all of this while building a working relationship with the candidate and his or her existing entourage of advisers, friends, and donors. This is what happened when Trump cycled through three campaign managers in his chaos-filled 2016 White House run, although he managed to survive the churn and win the presidency.

A brand-new campaign manager we’ll call Andy found himself in this situation just thirty-five days before the November congressional election. Although only thirty-four years old, Andy was no political novice. Four times he had successfully managed his own campaign for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives—so successfully, in fact, that Andy had no opposition in the upcoming November general election. This congressional race would be much more difficult. Andy’s candidate, Tom, was a moderate Republican and a political novice running against a one-term Democratic congressman. By Massachusetts standards, the district was one of the more competitive in the heavily Democratic state, yet Andy knew it would be an uphill fight. However, a recently completed poll suggested they were within striking range, showing the incumbent with 41 percent, Tom with 30 percent, and 29 percent undecided.22

The previous campaign manager, a midwestern outsider whom Tom had hired over the phone, had ten days earlier agreed to stay on and run the fundraising operation; he was now located at a different campaign office than Andy and the rest of the staff. Andy had heard that both the campaign field director and the campaign scheduler had been interested in running the campaign without a manager. But the campaign’s general consultant, a friend of Andy’s, felt the campaign needed a more senior person in charge. Andy certainly was not looking for this job, but his consultant friend talked him into taking it, saying it would be good for the Massachusetts Republican Party and for Andy’s own political career.23

Andy’s first day on the job was a Monday: “I remember it well. I think I was the fifth campaign manager, and I think four of the campaign managers were still employees of the campaign or had an advisory role with the campaign, so it was very awkward.” Andy knew he wouldn’t have the time or even the authority to put together his own campaign team or rethink the campaign’s strategic direction. “I’m not sure I was given the authority to hire and fire. I didn’t feel as if I did. . . . Coming into the campaign that late, you don’t really have the opportunity to hire new people,” Andy recalled in an interview with the authors. “You can bring in people to fill holes, but you can’t create a hole to be filled. So I kind of inherited a team and I had to work with it.”24

Andy did not know the candidate Tom nearly as well as the others who had been working on the campaign for months, and this further complicated his job. “It was really hard because it wasn’t as if I had the complete confidence or trust of the candidate, because I hadn’t been around long enough for the candidate to know me or for me to know him. It’s the same situation with the candidate’s spouse, and candidly, it’s the same situation with a lot of the financial backers of the campaign.” As Andy put it, he was brought on to get things done, to be a “transactional leader” as opposed to a “transformational leader” who would have changed the whole direction of the campaign. He generally agreed with and was committed to pursuing the strategy that had been laid out in a fifteen-page planning document prepared for Tom in the spring.25

> It was less about strategy and more about implementation of strategic tactics to get [our] vote. You didn’t have time to change the strategy of the campaign or really have an impact on the communication strategy in particular. You had to execute. So you had to motivate people to do a better job, but it wasn’t that the job changed, you just had to motivate them to do their job because time was running out and the effort had to produce results in a very short time.
> 
> I inherited the policy work and the field expertise, the scheduler, the finance effort basically had been done—there was very little work I did on the fundraising side. It was mostly the execution of a get-out-the-vote (GOTV) effort, scheduling the candidate to be at the right place at the right time with an audience that was strategically relevant. And making sure that the nuts and bolts were there to identify the vote and pull it out on election day. It was not about coming up with a grand strategy for the campaign.

One of Andy’s key objectives was to generate news coverage of Tom. The suburban district was located on the fringes of the large and very expensive Boston media market.26 The campaign could afford a modest radio buy, but Boston television advertising would likely be scant or nonexistent. This was going to be an old-school retail style event-to-event campaign, and Andy wanted press coverage of those events. It was tough to generate news coverage of the contest in the major Boston media, but the several small towns in the district had their own local newspapers and radio stations who reported on the race. Most news reporters had taken a liking to Tom, a lawyer from a blue-collar family who had a good way with people and small groups. Andy recalled the following:

> [I wanted] the candidate to be very, very visible, to the extent possible, including media outlets in the campaign schedule. So it wasn’t just showing up to a plant, or a cocktail party, or a coffee party, or a Rotary Club meeting, there was also [a] plan to get media coverage and editorial board meetings.27

Andy’s time was also taken up by dealing with the large number of part-time consultants and friendly advisers who would periodically check in to see what was happening and offer their own opinions as to what the campaign should and should not be doing. Although he generally respected them and valued their advice, Andy was in execution mode and didn’t want the campaign to be slowed down by what he called “meddling and second guessing.” But Andy also realized that part of his job was similar to the constituent service he provided to residents of his district as a state representative. So, like other people-savvy campaign managers, Andy made the time to keep Tom’s inner circle briefed, involved, and generally satisfied with the campaign’s progress.28

Among campaign staffers and volunteers, Andy’s people and management skills also paid dividends. The staff remained intact and productive, there were no major blowups, targets were met, and the strategy was enforced. The race was going to be close, and Andy knew the campaign needed a break to put it over the top. There were high hopes for an influence-peddling investigation of the incumbent member of Congress related to his previous tenure as a town mayor, but he was cleared of those charges before the election. In November, Tom lost the race by a margin of just 2.7 percent.29 Still, Andy’s deft leadership—his ability to enforce the strategy and achieve buy-in from his team—helped give Tom a shot at victory.

In fact, the campaign Andy managed took place in 1980 and pitted Republican Tom Trimarco against first-term incumbent Democrat Nick Mavroules in the coastal 6th Congressional District north of Boston. Even though they lost, Andy said the campaign proved to be a step on the way to political success for at least two of his young staffers. Field director Joe Malone was elected Massachusetts state treasurer in 1990 and reelected in 1994.30 The campaign’s research director, Peter Torkildsen, was elected to the Massachusetts state house in 1984.31 In 1992, Torkildsen was elected to Congress, defeating none other than Nick Mavroules, who was fined $15,000 and sentenced to prison for accepting the free use of a beach house and no-cost leased automobiles while a member of Congress.32 The break Andy had been looking for in the fall of 1980 came twelve years too late for Trimarco but just in time for Torkildsen.

“Andy” is Andy Card, and after the 1980 race, Card’s own political career still held in store a couple of hard knocks. In 1982, Andy ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for governor. Even while losing, he did impress the winning candidate, who promptly asked Andy to manage his own general election campaign. They lost to Michael Dukakis.33 Despite three defeats in just two years, Andy’s political management skills were recognized in Washington, and he was offered a staff position in the Reagan White House where he rose to director of intergovernmental affairs dealing with governors and other state and local elected officials. Under President George H. W. Bush, who had defeated Dukakis in another “small world” political coincidence, Andy served as deputy chief of staff before being named secretary of transportation. After Bill Clinton defeated Bush in 1992, Andy served as White House representative to the Clinton transition. He then entered the private sector as president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association. In 2000, Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush asked Andy to manage the Republican National Convention. On November 26, 2000, Andrew L. Card was appointed to be chief of staff for president-elect George W. Bush and is most famously known for whispering news of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the ear of the president as he sat in a Florida elementary school classroom.34

Card served as president of Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, New Hampshire, until his resignation in 2016. Asked to describe his current relationship with politics, Card said the following:

> I still consider myself to be a political figure, I’m active in politics and am not afraid to be. I call for people to participate in politics, but I am not an active candidate nor am I actively engaged in a campaign right now . . . but I will be actively engaged as a partisan.35

# How Are We Doing?

Strategy enforcement seems at first blush a bit like insider baseball—a topic that matters mainly to political junkies and the reporters who cover them. But having a strong strategy enforcer in the manager’s slot enables the campaign to answer, “How are we doing?” as well as, “What are they doing?” and thus give their candidates the best shot possible of winning. Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign manager, defined the manager’s “most important role” as “arriv[ing] at a strategy, and then build[ing] a team and lead[ing] a team to execute that strategy.”36

Mike Shannon, who worked on George W. Bush’s two presidential campaigns, agreed. At the campaign’s outset, he said, the manager better “spend a significant amount of time . . . building a strong theory of how [the] candidate can win”—and then inculcate the strategy in the team to keep the campaign on its winning path.37 Steve Bell, who ran Heather Wilson’s congressional campaign from New Mexico in 1998, said that campaigns had to keep a tight focus on such questions as these: “Who do we have to move? Who can we move? How do we move them?”38 Mitt Romney reported to us that he agreed with his campaign manager’s strategic argument that his 2012 campaign should invest heavily in the Republican Iowa caucuses. “Our senior strategist was inclined to not have any role there at all, but our campaign manager disagreed. He argued that we should maintain a presence early on—an office and a few key people—and if things look good down the road, we should make a big effort. His view carried the day.” He implemented and enforced the strategy. Romney added, “If ever there were issues of disagreement, I was the final arbitrator.

Typically, however, the campaign manager was able to guide the senior team to reach consensus on strategic issues.”39 Without a clear strategy and collective sense of team-driven mission, the campaign’s problems can breed staff infighting and suspicion, draining the campaign’s energy, weakening the team’s focus on winning the election. Consider what transpired in those times when managers were unable to enforce a clear strategy and failed to ensure that the team was all moving in the same direction. In these instances, campaigns lost track of their candidate’s core identity, and their message discipline unraveled. One member of the Obama team pointed out that the lack of strategy enforcement on Romney’s general election campaign meant that Romney’s campaign ultimately veered “in a million different directions.”40 His team, she explained, tried to “[soften] him up,” turn him into a common man, and depict him as an economic Mr. Fix-It, yet none of the _resources/books//Inside Campaigns; Elections Through the Ey - Will Feltus stuck in the public’s mind or were ultimately persuasive to voters.41 This campaign professional also observed that her team made the same mistake eight years prior when they sent John Kerry hunting and failed to stick to a strategy about who Kerry was and why voters should hire him to replace the incumbent, George W. Bush.42 The lack of an enforcer and a team culture made Kerry more vulnerable to charges that he was a flip-flopper and Romney open to being attacked as an out-of-touch plutocrat.

Campaign managers agreed that once a campaign decision had been reached, all team members had to support and execute it to the best of their ability. Any good campaign team, Republican manager Adam Bodily argued, should be working in unison from the very same playbook and striving “toward the same goals.”43 Chris Durlak, who managed a 2010 state senate race in Pennsylvania, argued that managers who become bogged down amid the advice and comments “from the candidate, from the press,” and criticisms from their opponents risked losing sight of “the big picture.”44 He said that in some cases managers got so immersed in the campaign’s daily problems that they were “going native,” failing to see the treetops while running from one crisis to the next.45

Another campaign manager stressed that his job was to steer the campaign down the right path. As a manager, he had to ensure all the campaign’s resources—the candidate’s time, his time, staff time, volunteer efforts, and money—were all propelling them in the same direction. Almost everybody associated with the campaign, including the candidate, was going to have strong ideas on how the campaign’s resources should be allocated. With millions of dollars at stake and much else riding on the election’s results, it was the strategy enforcer’s job to say yes to the right things that advanced their strategic goals and nix ideas at odds with the larger goals of the particular campaign. The manager’s office, said one campaign professional, is where good ideas must go to die if a campaign’s strategy is going to find success.

In 2004, Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry went goose hunting in order to assure hunters and rural voters that he was not the flip-flopping, weak-kneed liberal that had been depicted by the Bush campaign. This photo came in the final days of the campaign and struck some of Kerry’s critics as a desperate, last-minute bid to shift his campaign’s strategy and messaging.

Democratic campaign manager Raiyan Syed explained that as the strategy enforcer, one of his candidates gave him “a NO button,” which, when pressed, announced, “No! No! No!” The gift to Syed from his boss was a less-than-subtle hint that he needed to be disciplined and ensure that the campaign’s strategic priorities were not being sacrificed on the altar of every good idea that came his way.46

Keeping track of “How are we doing?” is simply harder to do without a strong enforcer at the helm. Campaign managers, Republican Mike Shields said, must “make sure that the campaign stays focused on executing [the campaign] plan on a daily basis and to report back up where the plan is working and where it’s not working.” Finding the sweet spot is crucial. Campaigns that fail to adjust when conditions warrant often get stuck, single-mindedly wedded to a strategy that needs fine-tuning. Yet campaigns that are ever-shifting with no core rationale or message give late-night comedians, reporters, and political opponents the fodder they need to tag them as hollow, inauthentic flip-floppers or other pejorative labels. Effectively enforcing strategy requires that managers wield another skill—listening intently, consuming information, taking advice. “A really, really good leader . . . doesn’t just say, ‘Here’s what we’re going to do,’ but tries to be collaborative and listen to other people,” Shields told us. And then that leader makes a decision and executes the decision.47

Nonetheless, keeping the campaign clear-eyed about its strategy (as Carville did) is actually harder than it might sound. Campaigns are often filled with talented, smart professionals. They bring deep experience and strong opinions about what the winning strategy should be. Consultants are paid much money to advise campaigns on messaging, polling, and grassroots organizing, and guiding and enforcing the strategic decision process requires a delicate balancing act.

Consider the hard enforcement task facing Steven Law and his colleagues, who were working on Senator Mitch McConnell’s 1990 reelection campaign in Kentucky. In late 1989, a mentally ill man carrying an assault rifle entered the Standard Gravure printing factory in Louisville, Kentucky, and murdered eight people. The shooting accelerated the debate about passing an assault weapons ban in Congress, where McConnell was still a first-term senator.

Despite his incumbent status, McConnell’s reelection was anything but a slam dunk for Steven Law. McConnell had defeated a Democratic incumbent in 1984 by some 6,000 votes out of more than 1.2 million cast, and in 1992, he faced the formidable former Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane.48 McConnell had a perfect score from the National Rifle Association (NRA), and the group had endorsed him. McConnell and his team were torn.49 Two advisers argued that McConnell, as Law recalled, “ought to vote for [the ban]” because the national politics had shifted in favor of gun control. But their state director, “who had a strong sense of the state’s pro-gun culture, argued passionately that we should ‘dance with the one who brung you’—essentially, stick with our allies and vote against the ban. And that’s what we did.”50 Law recalled this about the vote:

> [It was] absolutely the right decision because people who cared about the issue on the other side weren’t going to be for us anyway. And to the NRA, it made our race that much more important, because we stood firm. The realization came home to me when I was driving in eastern Kentucky in October and heard pro-McConnell radio ads blanketing the airwaves, sponsored by the NRA.51

As the strategy enforcer, Law had to ensure that every view was aired and that once the strategy was set, the campaign stuck to its script and vigorously defended McConnell’s vote. They believed they had a winning strategy. And they were right. McConnell won by less than 5 percent of the vote in 1992, and the robust support from the NRA helped ensure McConnell’s reelection.

# Strategy Enforcer in the Age of Super PACS

One of the greatest recent challenges facing campaign managers tasked with enforcing strategy has been the advent of super PACs, following the Supreme Court’s _Citizens United_ decision in January 2010. The Court’s ruling said that spending on political campaigns was protected by the First Amendment’s free-speech clause, and as such, it could not be restricted. Under this law, deep-pocketed donors are permitted to donate millions of dollars to independent committees set up with the express purpose of running ads in support of or against a particular cause or candidate. As we saw in Chapter 8]], that is what Katie Packer did when she ran the anti-Trump super PAC during the 2016 GOP Iowa caucuses.

At the same time, under _Citizens United_, super PACs are not legally permitted to coordinate with the candidates’ campaigns, draining some of the power and authority from the campaigns. Super PACs spent tens of millions on television advertisements during the 2012 and 2014 election cycles—and the arms race is only growing exponentially.52 In the run-up to the 2016 presidential campaign, super PACs were assuming the character of shadow campaigns, raising far more money in some cases than the campaigns themselves. The development of flush super PACs funded by a single megadonor or handful of megadonors has already had big implications for campaigns and campaign managers. Led by strategists with close ties to the candidates, the 2016 super PACs became vehicles for candidates to raise unlimited sums from a small number of donors without adhering to fundraising restrictions that the official campaigns must follow. For example, Jeb Bush’s super PAC, Right to Rise, had raised a whopping $103 million by July 2015—nearly ten times what his official campaign had raised up until then. One of Bush’s closest strategists, Mike Murphy, was the man running Right to Rise. Yet despite spending tens of millions of dollars to aid Bush, the PAC failed to help him win a single state in the hard-fought Republican primary contest. (The _Los Angeles Times_ dubbed Right to Rise “one of the most expensive failures in American political history.”)53 Hillary Clinton’s super PAC was likewise managed by her 2008 campaign political director, Guy Cecil. “Super PAC donations totally change the game,” NPR reported after fundraising totals began to be released in mid-2015.54

The campaign managers couldn’t have agreed more. They pointed out that in answering the campaign question “What are they doing?” they must pay attention not just to their political opponents but also now more than ever to the outside groups that are raising and spending tens of millions of dollars to deliver messages directly to voters in the hopes of affecting election results. Thus, enforcing the strategy has become vastly more complicated since _Citizens United_. Campaign managers must pay rapt attention to what ads outside groups, over which they supposedly have no direct control, are running on television and other media platforms. Campaign managers, in short, were groping for a way to enforce their own campaign’s strategy without getting sidetracked by what the super PACs were doing. “You can’t overstate how [much super PACs affect] these campaigns,” manager Brad Beychock explained.55 He said that if campaigns spent between $6 and $15 million on a US Senate race in a midsize state, outside groups such as American Crossroads or Americans for Prosperity would “dwarf th[at] campaign spending.”56 Ultimately, he added, these groups had an impact on public policy and how members of Congress vote. “It’s only growing every day with _Citizens United_,” he lamented.57

On a less existential level, super PACs (also known as “independent expenditures”) make it harder for campaign managers to ensure that the campaign is reaching its targeted voters with a clear and forceful message. Republican campaign manager Gentry Collins described the conundrum created by super PACs. He called it “a friendly fire problem.”58 He explained that a “campaign manager . . . can say, ‘Look . . . in this particular state or district, we want the message to be about . . . growing the economy and creating jobs. That’s what our messaging is going to be about.’”59 But then this happens:

> All of a sudden, you have a third-party group who’s running ads . . . on immigration. And now you have a problem because what they may be saying on that or any particular issue . . . may excite base turnout but may be a big turnoff to some other part of the electorate, independents or moderates or swing voters.60

Those charged with leading the independent expenditure campaigns at the Republican Governor’s Association, National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), and on the Democratic side try to “first do no harm” with their outside-group spending, Collins explained. But, because the groups are barred from coordinating with the campaigns, doing no harm is easier to say rather than follow, he added.61

Super PAC spending on television ads can breed strategic confusion within a campaign environment, as Republican manager Matt McDonald fretted. “I’m scared to death of somebody who is not on the inside of the campaign making decisions that affect the outcome of my race. . . . It increases the number of players in the process” and sows a lot of uncertainty to create “a dynamic I don’t want.”62 Campaign managers had few concrete answers for how to keep their campaigns on track strategically in the face of substantial super PAC spending. And some managers expressed a deepening gloom and even cynicism about the political process due to super PACs’ influence. Democratic campaign pro Ashley Spillane pointed out that independent expenditures from third parties are almost completely focused on negative advertising. “I don’t remember running any positive ads at the [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) Independent Expenditure] in 2010,” she admitted. The candidates, saddled with limited resources, are asked to do the brunt of the positive messaging, whereas outside groups are increasingly expected to “beat the crap out of the other side.”63 (In contrast, however, the Bush-friendly Right to Rise super PAC spent millions of dollars on positive ads seeking to reintroduce the onetime Florida governor as a trusted conservative to the GOP’s faithful; as we noted, that strategy wasn’t effective.)64

Although their power to control super PACs’ messaging is circumscribed by the law, managers agreed that at bare minimum they needed to pay close attention to what the outside groups were doing with their messaging. California Republican operative Jarryd Gonzales told us that as the enforcer his plan was to “find out who’s buying . . . airtime . . . who’s using certain printers, . . . because . . . your resources are limited and the more you can find out about what’s going on, the better you can allocate your own resources” and adjust the campaign’s strategy, if necessary.65 So far, some campaigns have been slow to recalibrate based on what super PACs were doing in a race. Zac Moffatt, who worked on Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, argued that super PACs injected a degree of unpredictability that “hurt Mitt more than they helped him” during the primary.66

Moffatt pointed out that had it not been for super PAC spending, Newt Gingrich would have had to end his run after the Nevada primaries, and Rick Santorum also would have folded his campaign much earlier than he ultimately did. The super PACs “allowed people to stay in the race who had no campaign,” Moffatt pointed out.67 They gave Romney’s rivals cover from outside spending in which millions of dollars were devoted to destroying Romney. The super PAC spending harmed Romney’s image, softening him up for Obama, and forced him to devote limited time and resources to fending off his GOP rivals.

The worst mistake a manager could make on this score was to ignore the super PACs as if they were nonexistent, as Paul Tencher told us: “You have to win a campaign based on what’s the reality.” Tencher, who managed Joe Donnelly’s successful 2012 Democratic Senate bid from Indiana, revealed that when it became clear that super PACs were about to air ads attacking Donnelly, he and his team “made the [strategic] gamble right away to go up on television very, very early.” That unorthodox decision was necessitated by what the outside groups were doing, forcing him to shift course midcampaign and then enforce the strategy shift on his campaign team.68

# Fusing the Strategic Vision With The Campaign Team

James Carville learned his share of lessons by losing campaign after campaign before he finally began to win elections. He has worked on less-happy campaign teams than Clinton’s 1992 undertaking. By 1992, he had decided that Clinton’s campaign was going to do some things differently. For one, he opted against having a separate campaign team for the campaign trail. He had seen campaigns where the team on the road thinks its “doing all the work and the people back at the headquarters are just sitting there, drinking and fooling and talking to reporters.”69 Such divisions festered and became “destructive,” he told us, with people shouting at each other because each side regarded the other as incompetent and untrustworthy. In 1992, Carville integrated the road staff in the overall organization and “worked hard on having a good relationship with the road.” And he did something else that built the strategy into the campaign’s culture: He made sure that Clinton did not look “at the campaign as just something I’m raising money for them to go out and drink beer and have sex” and that the campaign team did not come to “[look] at the candidate as a giant pain in the ass.” Despite the political crises, Carville says of 1992, “the culture [of the campaign] was we had a great candidate.” The campaign was professionally run, armed with a laser-sharp focus on economic revival and health care, and it acquired a winning vibe. “If you can’t walk in to a campaign and assess immediately what these people are about, what the energy level is, what they all do, you’re missing something. . . . I’m trying to get out about 100 million voters. I want everybody here to know what the strategy is.”70

On that campaign, of course, he succeeded as a strategy enforcer. By fusing the strategic vision and the campaign team into a unified whole, the strategy and the team became, in essence, a singular force. As Carville’s experience shows us, when that merger happens on campaigns and when the staff is all striving to reach the same goal, it is an elegant thing for campaigns and the people who run them.

A strong team buffeted by a clear strategy gives almost any campaign the ability to give a strong answer to the core question from the campaign flowchart, “How are we doing?” At a minimum, the team at that time can know it is addressing with unity and focus the fundamental factors shaping the electoral terrain (i.e., the economy, presidential popularity, the state of the world). A shared strategy enforced by a strong team leader enables operatives to focus on mobilizing their most partisan voters and persuading their undecided targets as well as frees the candidate from any turmoil within to perform at his or her strategic best. When the strategy is enforced, the campaign manager knows that although little in politics is guaranteed, at least the campaign had prevented internal dissent from damaging the candidate’s brand and knocking the campaign off its plotted course. Managers who can play these overlapping roles give their campaigns an edge on the margins, a better chance of responding effectively to what their opponents and outside groups are doing, while making sure the campaign is performing as well as possible under whatever circumstances they are facing.

# 12 Candidate Caretaker and Confidant Handling Details and Building Trust

**I**n film and on television, the campaign manager is frequently romanticized as a sage candidate whisperer. Imagine the close-up of the earnest campaign manager holding his candidate’s elbow as she prepares to take the debate stage, leaning in close and saying something like, “It won’t be popular with some big donors, but it’s true. For the last time, you’ve got to say it!” The candidate grimaces but listens intently because over the years she and the manager have developed a high level of trust and the ability to honestly disagree with one another. The candidate quietly and seriously considers his advice because she knows the manager has only her best interests at heart. Finally she nods, puts her hand on his shoulder, and whispers back, “You’re right. Let’s do it.”

The campaign managers we interviewed didn’t tell us about any scenes like this. What they did tell us, however, suggests that Hollywood gets an important part right. Mutual trust and the ability to confide in one another are key ingredients in the successful candidate–campaign manager relationship. Although each relationship will be unique and can depend to a large extent on basic personal chemistry, campaign managers share some common beliefs about managing their relationship with the candidate, including the need to serve as a trusted confidant.

As we talked with experienced campaign pros, however, it became clear that before a manager can rise to the level of candidate confidant, there is a related caretaking or fixer role that campaign managers must first master. The candidate is the focus, but managers say the caretaking role must often be enlarged to include the extended circle of the candidate’s family, advisers, donors, volunteers, and friends. Much less glamorous than confidant, caretaker can mean taking care of larger needs, like briefing the candidate on his next campaign stop, or handling smaller details like reservations, laundry, a couple of extra head table seats at the fundraiser, or any of the other dozens of little requests and questions that find their way to the campaign manager’s desk. Managers and staffers who can take care of the details become indispensable to one another and to the candidate. Importantly, campaigns armed with caretakers are often better run; they tend to excel at targeting, reaching, and mobilizing voters—answering the five questions—when the candidate is relaxed, confident, and focused on key tasks such as fundraising and delivering the message to voters.

Without having established a level of mutual respect, candidates have trouble performing at the top of their abilities and targeting and reaching voters with a compelling message. Josh Ginsberg, who ran Chris Dudley’s near-miss 2010 Republican gubernatorial race in Oregon, argued that the campaign’s “most important commodity . . . is the candidate and his time. So with the candidate feeling comfortable with the decisions that are being made, it just means he’s going to be better out there on the campaign trail because he doesn’t have to worry about the little things.”1

# Becoming Indispensable

Campaigns are built out of many small moving pieces and mundane tasks that must be managed if the campaign is to move forward. No matter how compelling the candidate is or how brilliant the strategy, the devil is still in the details—the copier needs toner, the candidate’s cell phone is dead, or the PowerPoint presentation isn’t updated. The candidate hires a campaign manager and staff to take care of these details so she doesn’t have to do it herself, and the best managers, staffers, and even volunteers will make themselves indispensable if they can handle these tasks for the candidate and for others involved in the campaign.

Becoming indispensable is a fast path to increased responsibility and stature for junior campaign staffers. Roger Stone, now best known as the sometimes political confidant to Donald Trump, learned this as a teenager volunteering in the mayor’s race in his hometown of Norwalk, Connecticut. It was his first campaign experience, and instead of simply stuffing envelopes, ambitious young Roger wanted to do and learn more. In his case, the key was simply having the key:

> At the Republican headquarters, they had all these wooden folding chairs. And when they weren’t being used, they were all kept in this closet. There were about forty of them, and they were in this closet. And I noticed that the closet door had a lock on it, so I got a key to the lock. Now if anybody wanted the chairs, they had to call me. So I [had] made myself indispensable. I was there for every meeting because I had to unlock the closet so they could get the chairs. I would set them up, and then I would take them down after the meeting was over. But that way I was included in every meeting.2
> 
> —Roger Stone, former adviser to presidential candidate Donald Trump

Another story about becoming indispensable in a campaign was told to us by Mike Shannon, now a senior partner at Vianovo, a business management consultancy in Austin. As an undergraduate at Vanderbilt, Shannon knew he wanted to get an MBA. The top-tier business schools like to admit students with at least two years of work experience, so Shannon—after graduating from college in 1997—got a job working in corporate finance for a large energy company based in Texas. By 1999, Shannon was ready to get his MBA but considered putting it off for another year so he could do something he had always wanted to do.

“I decided to scratch an itch before going to graduate school,” said Shannon. “I always wanted to work on a campaign.”3 Shannon went up to Washington to scout for opportunities, including possibly by starting out in an office on Capitol Hill. People told him he should go back to Texas and try to get a job in Governor George W. Bush’s presidential campaign, which was in the middle of the 2000 Republican primary season and gearing up for the general election. “That’s where all the action is”4 is how Shannon described the advice he heard. Shannon remembered his tough job search:

> I knew a guy who knew a guy who knew Israel Hernandez [a Bush campaign staffer], who was in the strategy group. And I just kept calling him until he said he would have lunch with me. We have lunch, and at the end of lunch he says, “We are looking for someone to start as a volunteer. You’ll have to work your way onto staff. I need to talk to Karl [Rove], but I think you’d be a good fit. Can you start on Monday?” That was on a Wednesday. I said okay and slept on Israel’s couch for the next six weeks.5
> 
> —Mike Shannon, Vianovo

The campaign headquarters was in a sleek Austin high-rise just down the street from Governor Bush’s official residence in the state capital. Shannon quickly learned that the Bush campaign ran on a very tight budget when he was given an eight-year-old Apple computer. The computer was so old it could not connect to the Internet. “When I did any work, I had to put it on a floppy disk to get it to somebody. That’s how important I was when I started,” remembered Shannon. “Then one day, Karl Rove stuck his head out of his office and asked if anyone knew how to do PowerPoint. I said I did.”6 Shannon got a new computer and went to work. “It was kind of this crazy roller coaster like everybody has on campaigns,” he recalled. “You know, one minute I’m filing and answering phones, and the next thing you know, on a Wednesday, I’m at the [Republican National] Convention in Philadelphia, with Karl giving me a bunch of marching orders to take our strategy presentation and add twenty slides to it. And I work all night, and all of a sudden, on Thursday I’m up in [Dick] Cheney’s suite for the strategy briefing. And it was one of those surreal how did I get from there to here? situations.”7 After Shannon had become Rove’s indispensable PowerPoint clerk, another senior staffer started asking Shannon for help on projects. “I didn’t know who he was, but it turned out to be Matthew Dowd [the campaign pollster and media manager],” said Shannon. Dowd ended up moving into an office next to Rove’s while Shannon sat outside in the bullpen. “I was doing all of Karl’s [PowerPoint] presentations, and I started helping Matthew track all the polls and track all the media buys.”8

Becoming indispensable worked out well for Shannon. When Bush became president, Shannon did an eighteen-month stint in the Office of Strategic Initiatives (jokingly known inside the White House as the “strategery” group, in a reference to a _Saturday Night Live_ skit) before retiring from politics and heading off to enter the MBA program at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. But politics wasn’t finished with Shannon. While interning at a management consulting firm in 2003 between his first and second years, the call came from Dowd. “He said he needed me for the 2004 reelection starting in January,” recalled Shannon. “I said I wouldn’t be finished with my MBA, and he said, ‘Well, that’s when I need you.’”

At the end of the 2003 fall semester, Shannon took a leave of absence to begin a yearlong job as director of media planning. There, he managed the campaign’s advertising and media budgets, reporting to Dowd and campaign manager Ken Mehlman (profiled in Chapter 4]]). After the election, political analysts, as well as those inside the campaign, would credit Bush’s advertising operation as one of the campaign’s strengths. Shannon retired from campaign work a second time, finished his MBA, and got the job he wanted at a leading management consulting firm. None of our five key strategic questions can be addressed without the Shannons of the world, working hard behind the scenes to give the senior strategists and campaign manager the tools they need to execute on the campaign’s most urgent priorities.

# The Buffer and the Concierge

In presidential campaigns, a manager like Ken Mehlman will have a stable of staffers like Shannon. Most campaigns don’t, and managers find themselves taking care of things they’d rather not have to handle. One of these is listening to unsolicited campaign advice from the candidate’s inner circle. “[The campaign manager] has a very difficult job because he has to fend off a candidate’s family and friends and supporters, with a smile, and keep them doing the grassroots stuff that you want them to do and not worry about campaign strategy,” said Roger Stone, the former Trump adviser. “A thousand friends of the candidate are trying to get through with their idea that will win the election. Stop them—friends and donors and family.”9

The job is comparable to that of a hotel concierge, said Stone. “You need something from the candidate, you come to me, and I arrange it if it’s worth arranging. If you just want to give him a book or a letter, just give it to me. It needs handling—the handling of the friends and family—so the candidate can stay in the cocoon and stay on message.”10

The concierge analogy also fits when it comes to taking care of the candidate’s needs and those of his immediate household family, especially family members who are active as surrogate campaigners. With the campaign schedule controlling and consuming their time, the candidate and his partner often look to the campaign for help in managing the day-to-day details of life. For assistance, campaign managers look to the campaign’s scheduler, who in many campaigns also functions as the candidate’s personal assistant, and to the candidate’s traveling staff person who is commonly called the “body man.” The manager has the ultimate responsibility for keeping everyone happy, and in smaller, low-budget campaigns, it’s the managers themselves who end up playing caretaker. Sometimes the manager has to help the candidate park his car before they become a trusted confidant.

# Building Trust: “Jimmy, Here’s What We Need to Do”

In July 2003, James “Jimmy” Cauley met Barack Obama for the first time in a coffee shop across the street from Obama’s US Senate campaign headquarters. Cauley, a veteran campaign manager, was serving as chief of staff to newly elected representative Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD). Obama, as noted in Chapter 4]], was running in a crowded, seven-person Democratic primary and was hardly a shoo-in to be his party’s nominee, let alone to win the Senate seat. Cauley doubted that Obama’s campaign was the campaign for him. He went in to the meeting more interested in the free trip to Chicago than in the prospect of running an iffy Senate bid. Obama’s race wasn’t high-profile and seemed like a bit of a long shot. Cauley was unenthused.11

The meeting went well. Cauley was blunt with the candidate about the kind of race he would run if he managed his campaign. If Obama wanted to run a campaign targeting a broad constituency, Cauley told him, he could do that, and he knew how to win. But if he wanted to restrict his focus to mobilizing African American voters and fail to build a big coalition, Cauley said he wasn’t the right fit. Obama assured him that building a broad coalition and winning the election were his highest priorities, and he quickly won over Cauley with his charisma, savvy, and political intelligence.12 Cauley was persuaded to move to Chicago and go to work for Barack Obama.

It’s hard to imagine an odder pairing than the caustic Cauley managing the campaign of the preternaturally calm and cerebral Obama. Cauley was a working- class white political operative from the Appalachian hill country in Kentucky who graduated from the University of Kentucky. He habitually salted his sentences with f-bombs. Obama, in contrast, was an African American Harvard Law graduate who was raised in Hawaii. He was back then an Illinois state senator with a reformist bent who taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago.

But over the coming months, at a time when few Americans had heard of Barack Obama, Cauley and the future president formed a bond, primarily professional but also one with a distinctly personal touch. They reached a kind of unspoken understanding. Obama developed trust in Cauley’s discretion and judgment, and Cauley learned to respect Obama’s quirks, harness his political talents, meet the candidate’s needs, and handle his family and friends with Kentucky bluntness and diplomatic niceties. Cauley said that on a lot of campaigns, his job was to let the candidate vent “when they’ve had a bad day. . . . But that also means that when I’m getting yelled at, they’ve got my back, which leads to trust. So you [need to] have that relationship where you can speak your mind in private.”13

Campaign managers, Cauley told us, “deal with people and their problems.” That was certainly true during Obama’s 2004 Senate run. At first, Obama refused to let a driver take him to Springfield because he had wanted to preserve “his alone time.” Cauley was frustrated that Obama would lose thirty minutes here and thirty there as the candidate searched for his own parking spot. “It was a huge fight to get him to take a driver in the car,” Cauley explained. When he finally convinced Obama to let somebody drive him to campaign events, he then learned that Obama was still getting lost.14

Cauley asked the driver, “How can you get lost with GPS?”

“Well, Barack don’t like to turn it on,” the driver replied.

Apoplectic, Cauley feared the driver was becoming “Barack’s best friend and not working for me.” Cauley warned him, “I didn’t hire you to make him happy. I hired you to get him from A to B at the right time.” If Obama kept getting delayed to events and meetings, Cauley felt, the schedule would be out of whack, and the campaign would miss some opportunities to raise money and win votes.15

But the hardest part of his job, Cauley told us, was managing the candidate’s friends, especially their constant advice, anxieties, and their dire predictions about the campaign’s losing direction. About four or five weeks before the primary, Obama’s friends called and said, according to Cauley, “Oh my God, you’re losing. You got to get on the air. We’d done all this work and raised all this money, you’ve got to get on the air.” At first, Obama felt confident in the campaign’s plan and didn’t let the warnings shake him. Their plan was based on their budget: They were to start advertising around three weeks prior to election day. But before long, Obama started wavering, and Cauley bore the brunt of the candidate’s second-guessing. Obama suggested to Cauley that they spend $200,000 in the Chicago media market right away, which would have upended their television strategy. “You know what 200 grand in the Chicago media market is?” Cauley asked. “You might as well take that money out in the yard and burn that shit.”16

“Dude, we’re going to go up when we can go up,” Cauley assured the candidate. Cauley explained that at week five, Obama “was behind me. Week four, he started wavering. And we got on the air week three or he’d probably fire me and spent the money.” Their plan succeeded.

Obama won the primary. He retained faith in the advertising strategy and had confidence in Cauley’s judgment. Cauley managed to persuade the candidate that he understood more about spending the campaign’s resources wisely to reach their targeted voters with the campaign’s message than his informal circle of adviser-friends.

And yet the challenge of managing Obama’s friends didn’t end there. Obama’s law school friends urged Obama to wade deep into policy during the campaign. Cauley considered their prescriptions a path to defeat and refused to be dragooned into letting the campaign veer off course.

> There’s a whole cubby of Harvard fucks around me, oh, everywhere. Oh, they would come in and tell me, “Jimmy, here’s what we need to do. We need to do a white paper on Israel.” And I’m like, “You know what? Here’s a stack of literature. You need to go down the neighborhood and knock on some damn doors. Get out of my face.” But around him, there’s always a circle of Harvard freaks. And they all think they’re goddamn geniuses, and they all think they made the world spin by themselves. And if I don’t listen to them, he’s going to lose this race. And that’s what they’d tell me to my face. And I’d be like, “Here’s some lit. There’s a street. Here’s a map. Go hit some doors.”17

Managing the candidate’s spouse is another delicate challenge, as Cauley knows firsthand. One day, he recounted, Michelle Obama phoned Cauley. Mrs. Obama was upset that Barack had missed one of Malia and Sasha’s parent-teacher conferences at the Lab School in Chicago. “He missed it. He and his dumbass driver missed it,” Cauley recalled. “He told her it was [my fault]. So she calls me up that afternoon and she blisters me, and you know what I did, as the manager, I took it. . . . I adore [Michelle] . . . because she basically left me alone. She was raising her kids and she was making money and she was holding up the homestead. She was a very pleasant spouse to work with. . . . But what I realized was . . . he used me as the weapon with which to fend her off. So I just smiled and took it on the chin like a good manager.”18 Cauley simply promised her it wouldn’t happen again.

As campaign manager, Cauley felt responsible for Obama’s schedule, the budget, making sure the campaign ran smoothly, that his family had enough time with him, and that the overall plan was being enacted in the right way. His relationship with Obama was important to achieving all of these goals. Without having Obama’s loyalty and winning his trust, the campaign’s strategic plan could collapse. Other decision makers could step in to the void and upend the strategy. Infighting would ensue. Cauley knew that he should try to lessen the strain on Obama and that their mutual respect was going to help keep the campaign on track to reach its goals.

Mutual respect built on trust is among the most vital elements in any robust candidate–manager relationship. Consider how some of our respondents described the impact of trust in their relationships with their candidates on their campaigns:

> I think there has to be like a sibling relationship. I think you need to know each other well like siblings do, but also siblings aren’t afraid to call each other out.19
> 
> —Adam Bodily, Duane Snow for Supervisor, 2009 (VA); Mitt Romney for President, 2008

> The best campaign managers in the world have that kind of back and forth where they can tell their candidate they’re wrong. But they’ve built enough trust to where they really think that the candidate believes them. The worst campaign managers in the world are the ones that think they’re always right.20
> 
> —Casey Phillips, Van Taylor for Congress, 2006 (TX)

> You have to have the candidate buy into what you want to do. . . . If you need to persuade a candidate, you must work with their closest friends, family, spouse, etc., to help them sell your point of view.21
> 
> —Graham Shafer, Michael Steele for US Senate, 2006 (MD); Van Hilleary for Governor, 2002 (TN)

Michael Bloomberg’s campaign manager Kevin Sheekey told us that the candidate running for reelection needs “to be focused on being someone in that job” and “let the campaign do all the dirty work. The candidate has to have complete trust in the campaign manager to make those decisions and run it. And I’ve almost never met a candidate who I thought had any aptitude for running a campaign.”22 And the campaigns that aren’t well run, he added, “are ones that don’t have a clear manager and have a series of people” arguing over decisions.23

# Building the Relationship

To answer the “How are we doing?” and “What are they doing?” questions, campaign managers must have achieved a level of trust with their candidates to tell them how they are performing on the stump, how their opponents are faring, and what needs to be tweaked. The campaign manager needs the moral authority to be able to tell the candidate whether he has met their fundraising, outreach, and advertising goals and what they should do differently to hit their targets.

Survey respondents almost universally agreed that the candidate–manager relationship affected the quality of the campaign and even election outcomes, albeit indirectly. Almost all campaign activities—shaping the candidate’s image, delivering the message, making budget decisions, fundraising, microtargeting, canvassing, having debate prep, to name a few—are affected by the candidate–manager relationship. Thus, the ability of candidates to make their case to the voters, to perform well at town halls and during debates, and to avoid gaffes that distract the campaign from core tasks is crucial. Although bad candidates such as Kansas’s Pat Roberts sometimes win their races and good candidates such as North Carolina’s Kay Hagan sometimes lose theirs, strong candidates can sometimes win close elections, and the converse is true for bad candidates—and how the campaign performs can rest, at least in part, on the candidate’s confidence in and comfort level with her manager.

Consider what some of the managers said. Travis Worl, Sanford Bishop’s 2012 Georgia congressional campaign manager, argued that candidates who trust their managers can more easily let their managers make strategic decisions. Candidates, he said, are “going to ask you your opinion on those issues and also what you recommend that they should do.” Although many decisions won’t determine the outcome, “some decisions about message, about what a candidate should say in an interview, about a candidate being on call time . . . are critical.”24 He added the following:

> And if your candidate won’t do call time and you won’t just call them and say, “You need to get into the call-time room right now,” then you’re not doing your job for them. And if there’s something that your candidate wants to say and feels like they need to say, but you feel like if they say it, it’s going to be terrible for the campaign, you need to make that known. It’s one of those critical times, if you do not stick to your guns and say, “You know, I think this is going to destroy your campaign,” and if they decided “Okay then, you know, I don’t want you for this campaign . . .” that’s your job. I’ve been fired from campaigns, but I was so because we disagreed about which way the campaign should go. . . . I’m not going to spend $50,000 on fucking yard signs.”25

One of the manager’s hardest tasks is getting the candidate to buy into the strategy. Managers have to persuade candidates to do what’s needed to keep the campaign on a winning course, balancing the candidate’s preferences with the campaign’s strategic priorities. Indeed, some survey respondents told us that serving as a candidate confidant was the single most important task they had. Most candidates need to be provoked, cajoled, inspired, and reasoned with. It is their name on the ballot, and they feel the most pressure—and the manager needs to inject sanity into the relationship and the political process.

The absence of trust can disrupt a campaign and lead to strategic chaos. Although the media often hypes the importance of internecine campaign warfare, internal campaign dynamics, according to our survey respondents, affect campaign trajectories. The activities that affect the vote totals become harder to execute when the candidate–manager relationship is based not on trust but on suspicion. Michael Sullivan, who managed Republican Patrick Hughes’s 2010 Illinois campaign for US Senate, said the manager’s “number one job is managing the candidate”—especially his expectations of money, polls, and votes.26 “Anything they hear about the campaign should probably come through you,” he argued. Jarryd Gonzales, who ran the Republican Gloria Matta Tuchman for Congress 2000 campaign in California, agreed that managers and candidates had to be aligned on the strategy, the candidates’ roles, and the families’ roles.27

Partners in a campaign firm, Democratic managers Jen Pihlaja and Martha McKenna approached the candidate–manager relationship through a similar lens. McKenna told us that candidates were doing one of “the most brave and courageous thing[s]” imaginable. Being the campaign manager, she added, means that “you’re entrusted with that person’s name and reputation,” and “that comes with a seriousness and a responsibility that both is important and exhilarating.”28

Pihlaja stressed that managers who became confidants were able to execute the campaign plan more effectively and give their candidates a better shot at victory.

> The most important thing is to win the candidate’s trust by doing whatever the candidate needs you to do, whether it’s some candidates need you to go out with them on the stump and spend time with them, and some candidates would rather you never come out with them on the stump, but instead make their kitchen cabinet feel important. The most important thing in my mind is establishing the trust that you need.29

Although cynicism about politics and politicians is axiomatic nowadays, many of the managers interviewed for this book felt inspired by their candidates—and the ideas and causes for which they were fighting. Managing somebody’s campaign, Pihlaja said, is “amazing for all the right reasons.”30 Thus, the managers we talked to were not all, by any stretch, hired guns, roving from race to race, regardless of the candidate or the issues. Contrary to popular belief, and overwhelmingly negative impressions of electoral politics, as David Axelrod told us, the best managers forged candidate relationships “rooted in absolute trust.”31 Axelrod added the following:

> I’m always cognizant of the fact that when candidates run for office . . . this is their life. . . . And often, . . . you’re risking your reputation, you’re jeopardizing your future, at least in politics. And you need to have a sense of trust in your manager that they’re, A, going to be consistent with your values, and, B, that they’re going to be strategically and tactically sound. And see that they’re going to be able to manage those under them effectively. And if you have those three elements, you have the makings of a strong manager and a strong manager–candidate relationship.32

Nothing is more damaging to a candidate than being branded as inauthentic. The candidate–manager relationship can influence the candidate’s image. Managers must become a confidant to run a campaign that, Brad Todd, from OnMessage, Inc., told us, “looks, feels, and smells like the candidate.”33 Managers must know their candidates well enough to help them develop a message that’s true to who they are and what they believe. When that doesn’t happen, the campaign winds up playing defense. When Vice President Al Gore ran for president in 2000, word leaked that he had hired image consultants, who counseled him to wear more “earth tones” to soften his public persona. This followed Gore’s previous assertion that he had helped invent the Internet. Although Gore’s missteps can’t be blamed on his campaign manager alone, the manager’s inability to stop the campaign from reinventing itself hurt their cause. In June 2000, five months before the general election, Al Gore replaced his ailing campaign chairman Tony Coelho with Commerce Secretary William Daley. One person close to Coelho told the _New York Times_ that “Tony and Al Gore never really liked each other. There’s little mutual respect and no affection. They’re very different people.”34 Gore had little faith in Coelho and, the _Times_ reported, was consulting other aides behind Coelho’s back.35 The absence of harmony at the top fueled the narrative that Gore didn’t stand for anything and that his campaign was at sea.

Trust-based relationships enable the manager to keep morale high in tough times. Ashley Spillane, who ran Tim Walz’s Minnesota congressional race in 2010, said the following:

> Keeping morale high in the middle of running lots of negative ads and having your candidate hit on negative ads is [particularly] challenging. I personally watch the ads and think, _Oh God, their poor wife and kids that have to see this_. But as a manager, you have to stay focused, keep the candidate’s morale high, keep your staff’s morale high, keep them motivated and working as hard as they are.36

Sometimes even the best campaign managers are unable to control candidates who refuse to do the grunt work that it takes to win the election. In the late 1990s, for example, John Schulze was running a legislative race in northern Wisconsin and was badgering his candidate to get out and start knocking on doors. Although very few candidates like to spend time on the doors, this candidate had a particular disdain for the practice.

It was typical of this candidate to disappear for days on end—literally hide so he did not need to attend fundraisers, make phone calls, or knock on doors. One day close to the election, Schulze was unable to find the candidate at his usual haunts, so he went to the candidate’s house. After a thorough search of the premises, Schulze found the candidate hiding from him under his daughter’s bed. The candidate sheepishly tried to explain to Schulze that he was reattaching the headboard of his daughter’s bed. No matter what Schulze did, the candidate clearly wasn’t going to become a politician who enjoyed hand shaking and door knocking. There is no one-size-fits-all relationship; trust, in other words, assumes distinct forms.

In 2006, Jay Howser (who would go on to run Louisiana senator Mary Landrieu’s reelection campaign in 2008) managed the successful Brad Ellsworth for Congress race in Indiana’s 8th Congressional District. When Ellsworth announced his candidacy, he was a local sheriff. Howser explained how he had to take a different approach to preparing an incumbent like Landrieu than a challenger like Ellsworth. But his relationships with both candidates were also effective. The Ellsworth campaign, he said, required “a lot more of coaching than in 2008,” when he felt like he was more focused on “managing the pieces.” During the Ellsworth race, Howser’s advising the candidate created some friction. “But it was good for him, and it was good for me, and it was good for the campaign,” Howser concluded. “And he was always worried about being coached on the issues and thought he had to know every federal issue. And I was more like, ‘Actually, the fact that you don’t know every federal issue and you are more like a regular person actually helps you.’” Ellsworth proved to be a fast learner. “He was one of those guys that you told him to say this and he said that. And it was fantastic. You don’t get many of those [candidates]. So at the end of the day, he was a fantastic candidate who all he needed was a little bit of push to work a little harder and I think I gave him . . . that.”37 Indeed, not every candidate walks into a campaign a sparkling, polished diamond. According to 2008 Mitt Romney advance representative Adam Bodily, the best candidate “edits his own speeches up to the last minute. You know, think Bill Clinton or other people like that . . . gives the teleprompter operators a heart attack, that’s a good candidate.”38 But not all candidates can hit the ground running—especially if they are entering politics from the private sector or making the leap from local to national office. Particularly if a candidate is running for public office for the first time, there is a reasonable chance she won’t be as knowledgeable about state and national issues as the incumbent. She will need public speaking practice, issue briefings, and debate preparation all provided by the campaign. The manager must be able to direct these activities and help the candidate become a better candidate.

# Honesty

One of the toughest aspects of the confidant relationship is knowing how to help the candidate navigate political attacks on her record and leveling with her about the campaign’s direction. This includes helping the candidate deflect arrows thrown by opponents at the candidate’s character. Honesty, campaign managers routinely told us, is a crucial ingredient in building the candidate’s confidence and running a winning campaign.

Often, a candidate will have ideas about the direction of the campaign that run counter to the goals managers have set. He will be hearing from friends that say the message is all wrong, that the campaign’s colors should be different, that he should be spending more money on golf pin flags advertising the campaign (true story), and so on. The candidate, wanting to please everyone, will lay this at the doorstep of the campaign manager, who will need to be strong enough to say no. The manager will have to be honest about the hard choices facing the candidate and the campaign team.

This isn’t easy. Oftentimes, candidates are either incumbents who are used to having full staffs who accommodate their wishes or they are wealthy businesspeople who aren’t used to being told no.

A campaign manager who preferred not to be identified said the following:

> [You need to be able to] sit there and shoot the shit but then also talk about the campaign—at the same time like when he has a bad idea or is doing something wrong, be able to be very stern and almost . . . like a father scolding a child. So . . . they’ve got to think you’re their friend, but you’ve got to know you’re not. You’re almost their boss.

It is vital that a candidate get accurate, timely information from his campaign manager. As one Democratic congressional campaign manager told us, campaigns are full of people who want jobs with the candidate when he wins, so they kiss up to the candidate every chance they can get. This manager, who wished to remain anonymous, said his job “is not to be the guy’s friend.” And he said that getting close to the candidate and hoping for a job if the person wins does a disservice to the campaign. Too often, he said, “People work on campaigns to . . . get the job afterward. And as a result, . . . you try to almost ingratiate yourself with the candidate. And then you become kind of part of the whole boy’s club. . . . You protect your candidate from too much of what they don’t want to do.” If the candidate wants to cut the fundraising from the schedule, the manager said, “My job is to . . . give it to him straight” and “give my honest opinion of what is the most effective” way to win the election. The manager also said that if he developed “a level of trust with the candidate,” then “come October, when I say we need to go do X, he is willing to say, ‘Okay, we’ll go do this even if it’s not something I want to be doing.’”39

Many survey respondents stressed the importance of being the candidate’s confidant on the most intimate of issues. Candor to a degree unusual in most professional settings was often required. “Surprises” on the campaign trail can tarnish the candidate’s image and even derail the campaign’s strategy. Throughout the process, campaign managers need to know things about the candidate that even the candidate’s closest friends or spouse don’t know. And being able to prove to a candidate up front that you are capable of handling the most sensitive of information goes a long way in earning a candidate’s trust.

Screven Watson, who ran Rod Smith’s 2006 Florida governor’s race, conveyed the intimacy of the relationship and the role candor plays in the candidate–manager relationship. Navigating the shoals of politics in an age when any piece of a candidate’s (or staff’s) personal life is fair game in the digital world is complicated. Watson told us the following:

> I’ve had people tell me things that they’ve never told their wives. Doesn’t mean that I’m Sigmund Freud. I don’t care. I’m not going to judge you. . . . But I got to know. I have to know what’s out there . . . I had a story with a state senator that I had to tell him that his wife had taken their money and had to default. I said, “Senator, this isn’t easy for me, but I got to tell you this because if I know, they know.” And I had to tell him that his wife had blown their money, had lawsuits out the wazoo, [and] had tax liens. And I knew he didn’t know. Color drained from his face.40

“You have to be a nonjudgmental confidant,” Watson argued.41 One candidate confessed to Watson that he had “an ex-wife who hates me” because he didn’t pay child support. Watson had to be prepared for attacks on his candidate’s character from opponents, who could use his ex-wife to validate the charges. Watson once had to ask another candidate’s ex-wife if she’d be willing to defend the candidate if the campaign needed her to vouch for him.

The confidant relationship also involved the manager leveling with the candidate about activities and decisions that could harm their chances on election day. For example, Watson had candidates who liked to drink, so he strove “to keep them out of those environments” where they might get drunk. The campaign manager has “to be able to keep the candidate away from his or her own weaknesses: of the flesh, of the bottle, of . . . talking too much to the press.” Being truthful with the candidate is a crucial way to handling these hard situations. Trust is built, at least in part, on honesty.42

According to many of our respondents, the campaign manager also needs to be able to keep candidates from becoming overly involved in internal campaign strategy. This, too, requires a level of straight talk. As Mississippi governor (and former Republican National Committee [RNC] chair) Haley Barbour told us, “You never saw a horse turn around and tell a jockey which way to run.” Another survey respondent warned that if the candidate starts running the campaign, “you end up putting up yard signs 24/7.” Candidates who lack faith in their campaign managers—who don’t think their managers are being up front with them about their campaign—end up wasting precious time and energy on strategic and organizational decisions best left to the manager.43

On occasion, a candidate’s instincts may be pretty good, and the campaign manager has to figure out how to persuade colleagues that the candidate’s judgment is on the mark. In 2004, the Barack Obama for US Senate campaign was set to run a television ad that featured the daughter of former senator Paul Simon, who had passed away in 2003 and whose seat Obama now sought. Prior to his death, Simon had been set to endorse Obama. The campaign, at the urging of adviser David Axelrod (who used to work for Simon), put an ad together that invoked Simon’s memory, with his daughter Sheila finishing the ad by saying, “I know Barack Obama will be a US senator in the Paul Simon tradition.”44

According to Jimmy Cauley, Obama detested the ad, thinking taking advantage of Simon’s death was too “weird.” But some campaign advisers insisted it be run; eventually, the campaign team ran it by a focus group. “In the summertime, we went back into focus groups, and we showed it in Peoria [outside the Chicago media market] to a group of white male[s]” who were over the age of thirty-five. The focus group, Cauley recalled, just “hated it. Oh, my God, all them white men thought it was just horrible, we’re taking advantage of a dead man.” Following the focus group, the campaign quickly pulled the ad.45

# Managing the Candidate’s Family

When Republican Indiana governor Mitch Daniels announced in May 2011 that he wouldn’t seek the GOP presidential nomination, he chalked it up to his family’s reticence about a national run. “In the end,” Daniels told supporters, “I was able to resolve every competing consideration but one, but that, the interests and wishes of my family, is the most important consideration of all. If I have disappointed you, I will always be sorry.”

Daniels took a lot of flak for laying his decision not to run at the feet of his family, especially because the Republican presidential field appeared to be very weak in early 2011. But to many candidates, the involvement of the family—and especially the candidate’s spouse—is vital to the campaign’s operation. A number of survey respondents argued that developing a relationship with the candidate’s spouse was one of their most important tasks.

Other respondents preferred to fully explain to the candidate’s family up front what a rough road lay ahead. They stressed that having an honest conversation with the candidate and candidate’s spouse explaining what it will be like for them is a vital step for a supportive family and a candidate performing at his or her best. Across the board, respondents wanted open communication with the candidate and the candidate’s family and would take calls any time of the day to address their concerns.

Unfortunately, although candidates tend to understand basic political strategy, family members are often less enlightened about the process. Oftentimes, family members don’t ask to get involved in politics; they are there only because they have to be. One campaign manager told us part of her job was to visit her candidate’s mother once a week to assure her that all the attacks against her son weren’t true.

But oftentimes the lack of political experience won’t prevent family members from offering the campaign pointers on any number of topics, including whether the campaign should go negative; or how many yard signs should be out on the street; or in which shopping center parking lot the candidate should shake hands all day, every day. Because in the end, it is their husband or wife, or son or daughter, or father and mother, and they want to be able to brag about their association with the candidate, not have to shy from it, and see their loved one succeed.

Yet although spouses always have an opinion, their input may not always be welcome:

> As a campaign manager, the spouse is without a doubt the toughest obstacle to overcome if they turn against you. You can have all the trust of the candidate, but the person that they lay their head down next to at night has the final word. So if you have splintered that relationship—if you lose that trust of either one of them, you’re in big trouble. That’s how campaign managers manage to get fired.46
> 
> —Casey Phillips, Delbert Hosemann for Secretary of State, 2007 (MS)

Furthermore, spouses will frequently have a say in the campaign’s scheduling operation. As Screven Watson told us, “God almighty, scheduling can kill you. It can eat you alive. The spouse of the candidate can get, ‘I want him or her home for dinner every night.’ Or, you know, his daughter or her daughter’s graduating. It means keeping the candidate happy. I mean, it’s vitally important.”47

# Losing and Winning: When the Campaign Ends

The final days of the campaign, as frenetic and intense as they are, don’t mark the end of the candidate–manager relationship. Managers felt a deep responsibility to their candidates in the event of a loss. Not only can a campaign financially ruin candidates, but it can also damage their personal reputations—especially worrisome if they plan on making another run for public office. One manager who requested anonymity told us this about part of his job:

> [It] is protecting the candidate from going into debt, taking too great of risks so that if they lose their job and they put 20 percent of their savings or 50 percent of their savings in the campaign, you have to protect them. You have to give them information, and toward the end of a campaign, you need to make sure you don’t go into debt unless they’re willing to. And you have to protect them legally too. . . . [And] whether you win or lose, sometimes the hardest job for the campaign manager is to deliver the news that you’ve lost and stay with the candidate so . . . they don’t do something stupid that embarrasses themselves for down the road.48

The manager also has to prepare the candidate “for the fact that election day is not the last day, that you’re not going to get a rest for three or four days afterward because the very first thing that needs to happen the next day is the candidate needs to get on the phone and . . . start calling all of the donors and supporters and people who contributed, not just financially, but also emotionally and in terms of time commitment and . . . thank them, whether they win or lose,” said Matt McDonald, Elia Pirozzi’s deputy campaign manager on his 1998 California congressional race.49

> If you know you’re going to lose, the only thing that you have within your control is the manner in which you go down. Does your candidate go down graciously, earning the respect of the people who fought with him? Or do they go out bitter and small and being somebody that nobody’s going to miss the next election?50

Although most Americans tell pollsters that they hate politics, campaigns and elections have lasting effects on how we live our lives. Health care, the economy, the environment, and myriad other issues depend on competent representation. Even though many of the managers told us that they enjoyed politics less as their careers have developed, they also expressed a surprising degree of optimism about and faith in the democratic process and their roles on the front lines of it. On the whole, these managers treated the voters with respect, admired and took inspiration from their candidates whose careers and reputations were at stake, and believed in the values and policies their candidates championed. Further, they understood the gravity of their roles—the responsibility for their candidate’s name and reputation, for the young people they hired and their futures, and for running a race that they could look back on with pride.

The insights the managers have offered to us recall Winston Churchill’s statement that democracy “is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.”51

# Appendix1 The Rise of the Campaign Webheads

**I**n the aftermath of Barack Obama’s presidential election victories in 2008 and 2012, it became clearer than ever that savvy campaign managers must integrate digital technologies and methods across multiple campaign functions in order to remain competitive. In both campaigns, Obama had used the Internet as a highly effective tool to harness the excitement of his base, raise large dollar sums through small dollar donations, mobilize primary and general election voters, garner earned media coverage, and advertise online to individually targeted and re-targeted voters on an unprecedented scale.2

Still, when all was said and done, even the Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012 spent far more money on old media (television) then they did on new media. As discussed in Chapter 7]], the spending patterns of the Clinton presidential campaign in 2016 were also pretty similar and pretty typical. In an age of new media, old media continues to capture the largest share of a campaign advertising expenditures. In the Clinton campaigns, the ratio was particularly strongly tilted towards television (both broadcast and cable). And Clinton’s opponents, first in the Democratic primary and then the general election, executed extensive and sophisticated digital campaigns. In fact, when all was said, aired, and published by the Trump campaign, it spent as much on digital advertising as it did on television advertising during the 2016 general election campaign.

More generally, as many campaign managers told us, digital continues to increase in importance for political campaigns and experienced political Webheads are increasingly in demand. Campaign managers turn to digital consulting firms to provide services which can include embedding experienced staffers and even digital vendors at their campaign headquarters. Here we look at two digital firms, and at the very different paths the agencies took to the 2016 Presidential election: Bernie Sanders’ Revolution Messaging agency in Washington, DC and Donald Trump’s Giles–Parscale agency based in San Antonio, Texas.3

# How ‘The Bern’ Was Born in Two Weeks

Scott Goodstein, as External Online Director for Obama for America in 2008, was well aware of the importance that digital technology would play in future elections, and he wanted to put the latest in digital campaigning to work for progressive Democrats whose priorities aligned with his own. He launched the agency Revolution Messaging with a mission to further progressive causes and candidates without compromising the agency’s values. In 2009, Keegan Goudiss joined Revolution Messaging as director of advertising. The agency’s growing client list of candidates and causes included independent expenditure work during the 2012 presidential cycle. With the 2016 presidential election approaching, Goodstein and Goudiss began looking for a candidate they could get behind.

In an interview with us, the two remembered the time around Christmas 2014. That’s when Goodstein, Goudiss and the other principals at Revolution Messaging began to seriously think about finding a progressive, values-aligned candidate for the 2016 presidential election. The trouble at the time for progressives was the assumption that the well-funded establishment candidate Hillary Clinton would use her overwhelming fundraising resources to sweep aside any progressive challengers. Goodstein knew he needed to find a candidate that “could be a dark horse and actually raise the money without being a millionaire.”4

As they began their internal considerations, Goodstein and Goudiss didn’t yet know that liberal independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was seriously considering challenging Clinton from the left. Tad Devine, Julian Mulvey and Mark Longabaugh of DML Message, a Democratic media consultancy firm, had been brought in by Sanders to lay the ground work for his possible run. The Sanders team would need to find a digital agency that could mobilize young voters and other progressive target groups. While there were already Bernie fans on sites like Facebook and Reddit, Sanders lacked the kind of sizable campaign supporter list that most candidates build in advance of a national run for office. He would need a team that could quickly build a list of social media supporters to give a national digital quick-start to his campaign, gaining momentum and donations, and skipping the usual presidential campaign warm-up.

> Bernie Sanders was a 2016 outsider longshot, but he was also the right kind of candidate for Revolution Messaging. “We knew whatever happened with Bernie, win or lose, it would be a respectable campaign. We would not embarrass ourselves. And _digital_ would be front and center,” says Scott Goodstein, with an emphasis on digital.

> Founder of Revolution Messaging, the 2015–2016 digital agency for Bernie Sanders’ Democratic primary campaign vs Hillary Clinton.

“Tad has been with him like thirty years, so Tad had the relationship [with candidate Sanders],” says Goodstein, who had worked on campaigns with Devine. Goodstein was even better acquainted with Devine’s partner, Julian Mulvey, who had been sharing campaign beers with Goodstein for years on Democratic political circuits. Soon Goodstein and Mulvey were talking Sanders. There was a political “flirtation period” in early 2015, as Goodstein recalls it, before Revolution Messaging could get the formal commitment to start work on the as-yet-unannounced Sanders presidential campaign. Sanders needed to make a go or no-go decision that only he could make. Goodstein and Goudiss cautioned friends Devine and Mulvey, both of whom were TV ad-makers, that their digital teams needed a two-month heads-up before Sanders announced in order to “figure this out, build it, and put it together,” says Goudiss. But winter turned to spring, and there was still no internal go-ahead from Sanders.

Sanders says he and wife Jane struggled to make a decision in the winter and spring of 2015. “Let me be honest. Jane was not enthusiastic about the idea of a presidential campaign—never was,” Sanders writes in his 2016 post-campaign memoir.5 Her concerns, Sanders says, included worrying about what would happen if Bernie won:

> She also worried about how, if against all odds we actually won, we could survive politically against the unprecedented hostility that was sure to come from Wall Street, the corporate world and their media, the Republican Party, and many Democrats. What we were trying to do was unprecedented in American history. We were taking on the entire political and economic establishment. If we won, what would happen the day after the election?6

By April, according to Sanders’ book, he and Jane had decided Sanders should launch a presidential campaign. Tad Devine, Sanders’ long-time confidant and the political entrepreneur behind the Sanders campaign-in-waiting, was summoned to Vermont.

> In early April, we invited Tad Devine, a national media and political consultant who had worked on two of my Vermont campaigns, to come to our home in Burlington to describe what a presidential campaign would entail. I am not much into national political consultants, and Tad is the only one I have ever worked with. Unlike Jane and me, Tad actually knew what a national campaign was about. He had been involved in Al Gore’s run for the presidency in 2000, as well as a number of other presidential campaigns.
> 
> Tad went down the checklist of what a campaign would mean. He talked about the tens of millions that would have to be raised, the scheduling requirements, staffing, security issues, how best to relate to national and state media, and the kind of paid media program that he thought we would need. He also believed that we would have to very heavily focus on Iowa and New Hampshire. If we made the decision to go forward, he was prepared be part of the team.7

Instead of getting the two-month heads up they thought they needed, Goodstein, Goudiss and their digital teams got only two weeks’ notice of Bernie’s announcement. Goodstein and Goudiss initially protested. “Can we just put it off a bit? You can’t get banners made from union printers and put your stuff together.” But Sanders was having none of it. In two weeks on April 30th, Sanders would announce to the Capitol Hill press corps that he was filing papers for a presidential campaign with a formal announcement to follow in about a month.8

Without headquarters or a campaign manager or even a bank account at first, the Bernie Sanders campaign would be launched in two weeks from two command-center conference rooms at the firms of Devine, Mulvey, Longabaugh, and Revolution Messaging where Goodstein says digital teams scrambled to build a website, payment gateways, email and text campaigns and acquisition, a branding style, and all the other pieces of the digital machine needed to support a presidential campaign. They needed to do two months’ work in two weeks. Despite the rush, the system needed to be robust enough to handle all the traffic that might follow the April 30th Sanders announcement. “People think crashing the site is cool because you have so much traffic. To me, that is not fun or cool in any shape, form, or way. That is just you losing [donor] dollars,” says Goodstein.

The Sanders digital team proved very good at closing their income inequality with Clinton by redistributing millions of dollars of donor wealth into Bernie’s presidential accounts. “The first 24 hours of the [April 30] announcement was spectacular, insane, and we raised over $1.5 million,” says Goodstein. “Wow, there’s a hunger and a desire. But you don’t know off that first 24 hours if that’s just a pop. Are these just people wanting to see a primary [with Clinton] or is this also based on Bernie’s message?” Sanders wrote about his online fundraising success after the April 30 announcement, and how the numbers gave his longshot campaign immediate credibility with the media:

> Sander’s Digital Fundraising Success Creates Credibility
> 
> _Writes Sanders_: My staff and I were shocked, and the national media was surprised as well, when in the first twenty-four hours of my candidacy, we raised $1.5 million in small contributions from 35,000 donors. After four days $3 million had come in from 75,000 donors. That’s serious money. The media may not pay much attention to the ideas that a candidate espouses, but they do pay attention to your fund-raising capabilities and, no matter how you slice it, 75,000 donors in four days was pretty impressive. As the media noted early on, I was raising more money than most of the Republican establishment candidates, and we were doing it with large numbers of small contributions.9

**Bernie Sanders announces that he is starting the official process of running for president**. The Senator’s brief statement on April 30, 2015 originated from the ‘Swamp,’ the nickname for the pre-wired outdoor (often hot and humid) press gathering area on the Senate side of Capitol. His political team had only two weeks’ notice of his announcement plans. See the ten-minute press event at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOIirPta4h4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOIirPta4h4\).

The momentum continued to grow with online events and fundraising appeals linked to Sanders’ big May 26 kick-off rally attended by more than 5,000 in Burlington. “We knew we were on to something,” says Goodstein as the fundraising numbers continued to rise. The Sanders team did not sit around waiting for online donors to show up. Digital advertising guru Keegan Goudiss would target paid ad impressions at past and potential donors. “I remember he would spend $250,000 and double it instantly,” says Goodstein who estimates digital advertising accounted for more than $61 million, about 28% of the campaign total, while adding more than three million people who opted-in to campaign email and messaging programs.

“The Bern” had been born in just six weeks and increasing numbers of Democratic primary voters were feeling it. In eight months, Goodstein and Goudiss would find themselves in the Sanders war room at an Iowa airport hotel on a snowy caucus night, February 1, 2016, with their longshot Bernie on the verge of upsetting the unbeatable Hillary. See that story in Chapter 8]], Stage Manager and Producer, which shows how the Sanders campaign used digital to do more than raise money.

> More on Bernie’s Digital Campaign from Goodstein and Goudiss
> 
> **Mobile accounted for 42% of all contributions**: “Having a strong mobile program was more important than ever in 2016, not just for the young people but for all of us in an increasingly mobile world,” says Goodstein, who created the first mobile program for Barack Obama in 2008. The Bernie 2016 mobile program, powered by vendor Revere Mobile, took off from day one. Revolution Messaging rolled out new advancements in mobile technology throughout the campaign and in the end 42% of all contributions came from a mobile phone.
> 
> **Website splash pages**: BernieSanders.com was constantly tested and optimized to maximize the number of people signing up to join the campaign. Revolution Messaging adapted the site for high-leverage moments by creating a unique “splash contribute” homepage. The feature helped the campaign raise more than $7 million in 24 hours when Bernie held a “National Fundraiser” during his New Hampshire victory speech. Before the first debate, they built a splash “signup to contribute” page that raised $337 per second in the first 30 minutes after the debate.

Notwithstanding the initial excitement from the base, Goudiss and Goodstein knew that the Sanders campaign had to overcome numerous obstacles, such as lack of name recognition and unfamiliarity with platform among voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. The campaign was also aware of the fact that young people drove Sanders’ base, and reaching them effectively could help tip the balance in their favor in the upcoming Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. “We knew that, as we got closer to the caucus, that really anyone under 35 was likely a caucus for Bernie as long as we could get them out.”10 Digital advertising would prove paramount to the Sanders campaign as it would answer one of the campaign’s primary questions, “how do we reach them?” With this in mind, Revolution Messaging implemented a digital advertising campaign that consisted of Facebook Canvas ads, Twitter conversational video ads, and YouTube bumper ads.11 But perhaps most innovatively, the Bernie Sanders campaign became the first Democratic campaign to use a Snapchat geofilter across the state of Iowa to drive turnout.12

Despite the focus on optimizing digital ads to best target voters and maximize returns13, Goudiss and Goodstein admit that there are limitations on relying too much on micro-targeting at the expense of developing quality content and other methods of campaigning.

“I think that being obsessed with micro-targeting can cause you to lose track of the bigger picture sometimes, like messaging,” Goudiss said. He continued: “On the Democratic side, some really smart people are doing some really good things, but on both sides of the aisle we have seen an over-reliance on microtargeting. It’s based off of people believing that there is an easy solution. They want to believe that we can just have a bunch of really smart data scientists come up with our whole [advertising] plan, and here’s the data, and we’re done. You know, but there are other parts to campaigning that are critical too.”

# How to Become a Presidential Campaign Webhead in Two Days

As a crowded Republican presidential primary heated up in early 2015, it was business as usual at Giles–Parscale, a growing commercial digital agency in San Antonio, Texas that employed about 45 professionals and serviced hundreds of businesses around the country. Their clients were corporate marketers who provided multi-year sources of steady project income. Among these repeat clients were several thrifty-minded, Trump-branded enterprises that discovered in 2011 that you could get attractive and functional websites produced by this little-known outfit in San Antonio for a fraction of the cost charged by the larger and more prestigious web design firms in New York City.14

The Trump projects were bid for and managed by Brad Parscale, who started his one-man web design business in 2005 and then merged with local designer Jill Giles in 2011. A tall former basketball player, Parscale is a self-taught coder and looks more computer jock than nerd. He enjoyed underpricing the fancy New York firms and doing good work out of San Antonio for a nationally-known family brand name. Parscale’s work soon earned a positive reputation in Trump Tower, and he got to know son Eric Trump, daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner.15

**Trump’s senior digital manager Brad Parscale interviewed on CBS’s _60 Minutes_ by Lesley Stahl**. “That is what I believe wins a campaign, TV,” Trump privately told Parscale on the 2016 campaign trail. “I don’t believe in this mumbo-jumbo digital stuff.” Parscale ended up running both digital and TV advertising for the 2016 Trump campaign, and was named overall manager of Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign.

Parscale would get emails from people in various Trump organizations requesting a price for a certain project. One of these emails arrived early in 2015 seeking a bid for a rush web design project that had to be up and running in just forty-eight hours. “Donald Trump is thinking about running for president. We need a website in two days” the email said, according to Parscale.16 He emailed back that his firm would do the Donald J. Trump for President exploratory website for a mere $1,500. This email exchange set in motion a series of events that changed Parscale’s life and led to him being named in February, 2018 as campaign manager for Trump’s 2020 re-election.17 Parscale told his story to CBS’s Lesley Stahl in an October, 2017 segment on _60 Minutes_.

Lesley Stahl: Tonight, you’re going to hear from a 41-year-old man who has remained largely unnoticed even though he was one of the top decision-makers of the Trump campaign. His name is Brad Parscale. While Steve Bannon, Paul Manafort, and Kellyanne Conway are marquee names you’re familiar with, Parscale was in the back room—operating as the campaign’s secret weapon.

Lesley Stahl: He was hired to run the digital team, but over time came to oversee advertising, data collection and much of the fund-raising. As digital director, he’s being drawn into the investigation of whether the campaign colluded with the Russians prior to the election. It’s a charge he denies. He says he was focused on competing with the Clinton campaign’s huge advantage in money and TV ads. What he decided to do was turn to social media—most importantly to Facebook.

Brad Parscale: I understood early that Facebook was how Donald Trump was going to win. Twitter is how he talked to the people. Facebook was going to be how he won.

Lesley Stahl: And Facebook IS how he won.

Brad Parscale: I think so. I think Donald Trump won, but I think Facebook was the method—it was the highway in which his car drove on.

Lesley Stahl: And Brad Parscale was in the driver’s seat. In the beginning of the campaign he worked alone at home in San Antonio, but by the end he had 100 people reporting to him. One of his main jobs was to send out carefully-tailored, low-cost digital ads to millions of people.

Lesley Stahl: And these were ads on Facebook?

Brad Parscale: Facebook, we did ‘em on Twitter, Google search, other platforms. Facebook was the 500-pound gorilla, 80 percent of the budget kind of thing.

Lesley Stahl: Facebook’s advertising technology helped President Obama in 2012, but today Facebook offers something far more precise and sophisticated. While the president recently tweeted that “Facebook was always anti-Trump,” Parscale relied heavily on the company, particularly on its cutting-edge targeting tools.

Lesley Stahl: One of the best things Facebook did for you, I heard, was penetrate the rural vote. Is that correct?

Brad Parscale: Yeah. So Facebook now lets you get to places and places possibly that you would never go with TV ads. Now, I can find, you know, 15 people in the Florida Panhandle that I would never buy a TV commercial for. And, we took opportunities that I think the other side didn’t.

Lesley Stahl: Like what?

Brad Parscale: Well, we had our—their staff embedded inside our offices.

Lesley Stahl: What?

Brad Parscale: Yeah, Facebook employees would show up for work every day in our offices.

Lesley Stahl: Whoa, wait a minute. Facebook employees showed up at the Trump headquarters—

Brad Parscale: Google employees, and Twitter employees.

Lesley Stahl: They were embedded in your campaign?

Brad Parscale: I mean, like, they were there multiple days a week, three, four days a week, two days week, five days a week—

Lesley Stahl: What were they doing inside? I mean—

Brad Parscale: Helping teach us how to use their platform. I wanna get—

Lesley Stahl: Helping him get elected?

Brad Parscale: I asked each one of them by email, I wanna know every, single secret button, click, technology you have. I wanna know everything you would tell Hillary’s campaign plus some. And I want your people here to teach me how to use it.

Lesley Stahl: Inside?

Brad Parscale: Yeah, I want ‘em sittin’ right next to us—

Lesley Stahl: How do you know they weren’t Trojan Horses?

Brad Parscale: ‘Cause I’d ask ‘em to be Republicans, and I’d—we’d talk to ‘em.

Lesley Stahl: Oh, you only wanted Republicans?

Brad Parscale:  I wanted people who support Donald Trump from their companies.

Lesley Stahl: And that’s what you got?

Brad Parscale: Yeah. They already have divisions set up that way.

Lesley Stahl: What do you mean?

Brad Parscale: They already have groups of people in their political divisions that are Republican and Democrat.

Lesley Stahl: You’re kidding?

Brad Parscale: Yeah, they’re businesses, they are publicly traded companies with stock price.

Lesley Stahl: Did Hillary’s campaign have someone embedded—

Brad Parscale: I had heard that they didn’t accept any of their offers.

Lesley Stahl: So you’re saying Facebook and the others offered an embed, and they said no.

Brad Parscale: That’s what I’ve heard.

Lesley Stahl: People in the Clinton campaign confirmed that the offer was made and turned down. Facebook told us in a statement: “. . .for candidates across the political spectrum, Facebook offers the same level of support in key moments to help campaigns understand how best to use the platform.” And indeed, both campaigns used Facebook’s technology extensively to reach out to potential voters. Parscale said the Trump campaign used the technology to micro-target on a scale never seen before—and to customize their ads for individual voters.

Brad Parscale: Changing language, words, colors, changing things because certain people like a green button better than a blue button. Some people like the word “donate” or “contribute.”

Lesley Stahl: So how would you know . . . let’s say I like a green button. How do you know I’d only like a green button?

Brad Parscale: Because I’d give you the red, blue buttons, you never click on ‘em.

Lesley Stahl: Parscale showed us how they tested: by sending out multiple versions of the same ad with only subtle differences.

Brad Parscale: Here we have an American flag, here we have a face of Hillary. Different colors, the blues, different messages above.

Lesley Stahl: So you’d send two identical ads with different colors?

Brad Parscale: Maybe thousands.

Lesley Stahl: You’d send THOUSAND of ads with different colors?

Brad Parscale: Different colors. What it is is: what can make people react? What catches their attention? Remember, there’s so much noise on your phone. You know, or on your desktop. What is it that makes it go: Poof! I’m gonna stop and look.

Lesley Stahl: To get people to stop and look, he crafted different messages for different people—so that you only got ads about the issues you cared about most. He showed us three ads that looked alike.

Brad Parscale: It’s pretty much the identical design. Positive coloring. Different message.

Lesley Stahl: This is one is tax, this one is childcare, this one is energy.

Brad Parscale: They were all targeted to different users of whatever platform, in this case it was Facebook.

Lesley Stahl: This one person at 11 Elm Street gets this one and 13 Elm Street gets that one.

Brad Parscale: Yup, yup.

Lesley Stahl: Parscale took some heat for taking microtargeting too far because he hired Cambridge Analytica. It’s a company that uses so-called psychographics that microtarget ads based on personality. For instance, an extrovert would get one kind of message, a neurotic person another. It’s controversial because of its Orwellian overtones. After Trump won, Cambridge Analytica said it was key to the victory. But Parscale insists he never used psychographics. He said it doesn’t work.

Lesley Stahl: So you didn’t use it because you didn’t think it really worked, as opposed to you didn’t use it because you thought it was wrong that it was manipulative or sinister, or something like that.

Brad Parscale: No, I don’t believe it’s sinister.

Lesley Stahl: No. OK, you just don’t think it works.

Brad Parscale: No, I just don’t think it works.

Lesley Stahl: Parscale’s title was digital director, but by the end of the campaign his portfolio grew. He oversaw data collection, polling, advertising both online and on TV, and significantly, digital fundraising. By adding donation buttons for people to click on in the online ads, he was able to bring in a record $240 million in small donations.

Lesley Stahl: How many presidential campaigns had you worked on before this one?

Brad Parscale: Zero.

Lesley Stahl: Your wife has a wonderful expression about you being thrown into this.

Brad Parscale: Yeah. She said that I was thrown into the Super Bowl, never played a game and won.

Lesley Stahl: That’s what it sounds like.

Lesley Stahl: It’s made him a local hero back home in Kansas. He grew up in Topeka, playing basketball—he’s 6 foot 8. After briefly working at a tech company in California, he moved to San Antonio, Texas, and became a marketer. He taught himself to code, opened a small web-design business and went looking for customers.

Brad Parscale: I started tapping shoulders at a bookstore asking people if they needed a website, when they were buying books on web design.

Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what—you’re hanging around at a bookstore?

Brad Parscale: Yeah, a Borders.

Lesley Stahl: You’re hanging around at Borders and say, “Can you hire me?”

Brad Parscale: Yeah.

Lesley Stahl: Come on.

Brad Parscale: Yeah.

Lesley Stahl: So how did you get involved with the Trump people?

Brad Parscale: I was sitting at IHOP and I got an email. I was eating a ham and cheese omelet. I was. I get an email and I open it up and it says—”This is Kathy K. from the Trump Org—can you please call me?” That’s it—

Lesley Stahl: Outta nowhere?

Brad Parscale: Outta nowhere.

Lesley Stahl: Six years ago she was looking for someone to design a website for a Trump real estate project. Parscale bid lowest, got the job, and soon many more followed: websites for Eric’s foundation, Melania’s skincare line, the family’s wineries. Then, in early 2015, came another life-changing email:

Brad Parscale: It said “Donald Trump is thinking about running for president. We need a website in two days.” So I wrote back, I said, “Yeah, I’ll do it for $1,500.”

Lesley Stahl: $1,500?

Brad Parscale:  Yeah. And by the end, it was $94 million.

Lesley Stahl: $94 million is what his company was paid. Much of it was spent on things like buying ads. Parscale learned very fast on the job, with the help of the Republican National Committee. They had amassed a giant database to identify the issues people cared about, and predict how nearly 200 million Americans would vote. One reason Parscale thinks President Trump won is because of an issue the RNC database honed in on that he says the Clinton campaign missed:

Lesley Stahl: Infrastructure.

Brad Parscale: Infrastructure. It was voters in the rust belt that cared about their roads being rebuilt, their highways, their bridges. They felt like the world was crumbling. So I started making ads that would show the bridge crumbling. You know, that’s microtargeting them. Because I can find the 1,500 people in one town that care about infrastructure. Now, that might be a voter that normally votes Democrat.

Lesley Stahl: While he tried to persuade Democrats to vote for Mr. Trump —the campaign was accused, in a Businessweek article, of trying to suppress the vote of “idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans,” a charge he denies.

Lesley Stahl: Did you micro target by race?

Brad Parscale: No we did not. Not at all.

Lesley Stahl: Never?

Brad Parscale: Nope.

Lesley Stahl: Did you post hateful _resources/books//Inside Campaigns; Elections Through the Ey - Will Feltus?

Brad Parscale: I don’t believe so.

Lesley Stahl: The candidate Trump was never shy about pushing buttons, about pushing prejudices. He used what most people would consider offensive language sometimes.

Brad Parscale: I don’t think the math said that most people saw it as offensive. I think a small group of people saw it as offensive, who have a lot of power.

Lesley Stahl: But you did mirror him?

Brad Parscale: We mirrored certain things that he would say, mainly things he said in rallies.

Lesley Stahl: Many of the messages he sent out were what’s known as dark ads. They’re called dark because they’re microtargeted to individual users who are the only ones who see them. Unless they choose to share them—they disappear.

Lesley Stahl: Can you say anything you want in those dark ads? They’re really not transparent?

Brad Parscale: No, because if I said something crazy in those, they would share a million times, it would be all over.

Lesley Stahl: So if you said something that appealed to racists?

Brad Parscale: Oh, it would be everywhere.

Lesley Stahl: But some dark ads flew under the radar, like ones sent out, we now know, by the Russians in their attempt to influence our election. These were separate from the posts the Russians reportedly sent of fake news stories that made Clinton look bad. The ads—on divisive issues—were spread using Facebook tools similar to the ones Parscale and the Clinton campaign used.

Lesley Stahl: Facebook has admitted that the Russians spent $100,000—at least $100,000—on ads to influence the U.S. campaign. Does that bother you?

Brad Parscale: Yeah, I would not want a foreign entity to meddle in our election; you know, a government. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn’t want that; I’m American.

Lesley Stahl: But the question is: did the Trump campaign collude with the Russians—and as the digital director, was Parscale involved?

Brad Parscale: I think it’s a joke. Like, at least for my part in it.

Lesley Stahl: Very few people think it’s a joke.

Brad Parscale: I think it’s a joke when they involve myself. ‘Cause I know my own activities, and I know the activities of this campaign. I was there. It’s just a farce.

Lesley Stahl: It’s a farce that you colluded with the Russians?

Brad Parscale: Yeah. It’s just a joke.

Lesley Stahl: What about what happened on Twitter? Which was flooded with pro-Trump tweets generated by robots, or bots.

Lesley Stahl: Did you have a hand in generating these bots—

Brad Parscale: I had nothing to do with bots. I don’t think bots work.

Lesley Stahl: You were called the king of the bots.

Brad Parscale: I know. It’s ridiculous. It’s just the craziest thing ever. No one on our team ever sat down with me and said, “Brad, we should make bots.”

Lesley Stahl: But if—if you see that there are hundreds of thousands of bots floating around with pro-Trump messages, somebody generated it. Where would it come from?

Brad Parscale: I would imagine there were people, everyday people in America, who thought they were trying to help. I don’t know.

Lesley Stahl: If the bots came from the Russians, would you know?

Brad Parscale: Nah.

Lesley Stahl: Do you think it might have?

Brad Parscale: No idea.

Lesley Stahl: Could it have?

Brad Parscale: Could be from anybody in the world.

Lesley Stahl: The House Intelligence Committee looking into the Russian meddling has contacted Parscale and he’s agreed to talk to them.

Lesley Stahl: I understand that part of these investigations that are going on is to understand how the Russians knew where to target their campaigns, their messages. They seemed to know specifically where to go—that were places that helped Trump

Brad Parscale: Yeah. First of all, I—it’s not very hard to figure out. Pennsylvania, Ohio, you know. I mean, the same—I think we’ve had the same swing states for decades.

Lesley Stahl: Parscale told us the Russian plotline is pushed by liberals who think they lost because he cheated. The irony, he says, is that it wasn’t a foreign entity helping the campaign, but left-leaning American companies like Twitter, Google, and above all Facebook.

Brad Parscale: These social platforms are all invented by very liberal people on the West and East Coast, and we figure out how to use it to push conservative values. I don’t think they ever thought that would happen. I would say the number one thing that people come up to me is, like, “I just never thought Republicans would be the ones to figure out how to use all this.”

Lesley Stahl: So a liberal invents all this stuff and a conservative in the Middle-West figures out how to use it?

Brad Parscale: And I think we used it better than anyone ever had in history.

Though the Trump campaign used numerous outlets to place digital advertisements, Parscale believed that Facebook would be the “500-pound gorilla” for the campaign.18 In an effort to get the most out of Facebook’s advertising technology, Parscale opted to embed Facebook staff into the campaign to teach them how to get the most out of the platform, an offer that Facebook made to both presidential campaigns but that only Trump’s campaign accepted.19 In an effort to find the most effective ads that resonated with voters the most, Trump’s digital team would constantly test different artwork with differences such as changing in messaging or even something as subtle as changing the color of buttons on the ads. All of this was automated and at any given moment, the campaign was running 100,000 different ads.20

As Parscale explained to Lesley Stahl in the 60 Minutes interview, “What it is is: what can make people react? What catches their attention? Remember, there’s so much noise on your phone. You know, or on your desktop. What is it that makes it go: Poof! I’m gonna stop and look.”21

Targeting different voters with different messaging in order to obtain their support is a crucial advantage that Parscale was well aware of and took advantage of throughout the 2016 election. While television advertising broadcasts a message an across an entire market or cable network and thus does not allow for microtargeting, Parscale and his team were able to send out targeted advertisements with different content to next-door neighbors.22

1 big thing . . . Scoop: Inside Trump’s 2020 startup

This was the headline on an May 15 ,2018 Axios story by Mike Allen and Jonathan Swan reporting on Brad Parscale’s plans for Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign. Following are excerpts from the article, reprinted with permission. For the full article see the URL below.

**As President Trump’s** campaign aides quietly launch his reelection campaign, they’re eyeing two states as possible pickups for 2020: **Minnesota**, where Trump came close in 2016 without even trying; and **Colorado**, where his hands-off approach to marijuana enforcement is a possible selling point.

- **The addition** of those states is part of a plan that’s coming together in a basement suite at the Republican National Committee, where the Trump campaign has moved from Trump Tower.
- **The campaign**, now fewer than 10 people, eventually will number hundreds.

**The reelection campaign** will mostly work under the radar until after midterms, providing Trump assets (volunteers, fundraising, rallies) to other campaigns.

- **But Jonathan Swan and I** got a first look at campaign manager Brad Parscale’s plans to build what amounts to a massive marketing machine, selling the world’s most prominent product.

**Why it matters:** In 2016, Trump Tower campaign staffers were proud of their pirate-ship ambush of the Republican establishment, then of the U.S.S. Clinton. But this time they won’t have the advantage of surprise.

- **So the Trump team** has to build a longer range, more systematic plan, without suffocating Trump’s improvisational essence.
- **Parscale**, who considers past presidential campaigns archaic, is emphasizing digital innovation, technological streamlining and corporate efficiency.
- **Parscale told us:** “We’re crushing it in prospecting.”

**What’s new:** It’s a sign of the times—and a reflection of what worked for Trump—that the digital director of the 2016 campaign will be the boss of the whole 2020 campaign.

- **It’s a fresh way** of flouting campaign orthodoxy, and gives Trump the comfort of elevating one of his originals.

**Why he matters:** Parscale, 42, is a completely unconventional choice for campaign manager and one that has raised eyebrows inside the White House and among Republican campaign veterans.

- **Some inside** the White House have told us they believe he “got lucky” by hitching his wagon to a candidate who won despite his campaign, not because of it.
- **Parscale had no history** in politics before the 2016 campaign, and doesn’t plan to work in politics beyond the 2020 campaign.
- **His connection** is to the Trump family—and especially to Jared Kushner and Eric Trump.
- **Parscale launched** the digital side of the Trump campaign from the San Antonio office of his firm Giles–Parscale, which grew to over 100 people as the campaign peaked, with revenues of $79 million for the cycle (much of which went to Facebook).

2. Scoop: Trump’s “big data” plan for 2020

**Trump reelection campaign manager** Brad Parscale starts with 18 million email and phone numbers (“hard contacts”) of likely Trump voters, and has a goal of **doubling that** that to 30 million to 40 million by Election Day 2020—roughly half of the votes Trump needs. (He got 63 million in 2016.)

- **Parscale plans** to spend $1 million per month for the rest of ‘18 on digital prospecting, with hopes to increase that next year.
- **The campaign** says it has had great success recruiting Trump supporters with ads on AOL (an older, Trump-friendly demographic), Bing, Facebook, Google and conservative news sites.

**The tech:** Using the language of digital prospecting, Parscale talks about moving from a softer contact like a Facebook profile, to an email address, to an action like donating, volunteering or declaring support.

- **Why it matters:** Parscale, the campaign’s digital director in 2016, wants to bring that sensibility to the entire 2020 operation, talking about applying just-in-time and other logistics management tools. The campaign will perform traditional functions like knocking on doors and staging rallies, but he wants to make it more efficient by adding a digital layer.

**What’s new:** Parscale showed us screenshots of project-management software he’s developing to improve campaign efficiency: making it possible, for instance, to get internal approvals online rather than going office to office, and to spot staff bottlenecks.

- **Parscale wants** to be able to use big data in real time—for instance, knowing what part of a city is optimal for a visit by a candidate or surrogate, and what issues are biggest there.
- **He’d like** to be able to send push notifications to staff about what to tweet, so they don’t have to dig through emails to find instructions.
- **Inside the machine:** As an example of a Parscale technique, people who attend a Trump rally have to give a phone number (with a maximum of two tickets per number), deterring fraud and harvesting valuable SMS text contacts.

# Real World Impacts

Despite the expanding role of webheads in political campaigns, campaigns ultimately exist for one real-world purpose: to win the election for their respective candidate. Therefore, aside from digital fundraising, the primary focus of digital campaigns is to encourage supporters to take action in the real-world, in the form of voting, attending campaign events or volunteering. Obama’s 2012 campaign set the standard for how presidential campaigns can use digital platforms to drive supporter participation in the campaign with the release of Dashboard, which became the campaign’s primary online organization tool.23 Dashboard allowed for the field directors to communicate seamlessly with different offices and coordinate volunteers. Chief Technology Officer of the Obama campaign described Dashboard as a way to bring a field office on the internet and provide volunteers with call sheets, walk lists, and scripts.24 Through these efforts, the Obama digital team facilitated volunteers and staff to directly target emerging voter groups and increase their turnout in support of Obama’s second term.25

The Sanders campaign implemented numerous digital strategies in order to encourage supporter participation and showing up to the polls. Turnout can make or break an upstart candidate, such as Bernie Sanders, in the Iowa Caucus. Knowing they had the support of young people, it was important for Goudiss and Goodstein to not only convince college students to caucus, but to do so back in their home county caucuses. As previously mentioned in the advertising section, the Sanders campaign employed Snapchat in order to convince the young people in Iowa to caucus.26 With the help of these efforts, Sanders was able to eke out a virtual tie with Clinton and solidify himself as a legitimate challenger against the frontrunner.27

The Iowa caucus marked only the start of the Democratic Primary. Goudiss and Goodstein, as well the rest of the Sanders campaign, had to rush to continue their campaign operations in New Hampshire. In an effort to ride the past success of the Iowa Caucus, the Sanders operation text messaged supporters in the middle of the night and encouraged 150 people to welcome Sanders to Manchester (this is further elaborated in Chapter 12]]). After the initial successes of using digital tools, the Sanders campaign continued to employ similar tactics to rally supporters throughout the remainder of the Democratic Primary.28

# Future Challenges

Though the Trump and Sanders campaigns proved the importance of webheads and digital operations in the 2016 election, there are numerous drawbacks and issues facing digital advertising and operations within political campaigns. First, unlike television or radio advertising, there is no way for political campaigns to track other campaigns’ expenditures online as digital vendors are not required to submit political expenditures to the FEC. One of the important questions campaign managers ask themselves when making decisions is “What are our opponents and allies doing?” as outlined in Chapter 3]]. This can leave campaigns blind in an increasingly crucial electoral battlefield, and campaigns thus have to adapt using other less effective methods. “We had Facebook accounts that were in different states that we were trying to monitor,” said Goudiss. Second, as of 2018, unlike television or radio advertisement, online ads do not follow the same FEC regulations that require a disclaimer that states who paid for the advertisements. In an effort to address this, the FEC is currently (as of 2018) looking into implementing rules that would force campaigns to disclose this information. Finally, in large part because of these aforementioned vulnerabilities, questionable actors and foreign agents can use potentially skirt America’s campaign laws and influence America’s elections. On February 16th, 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller secured an indictment of thirteen Russian agents for interfering in the 2016 election by spending millions in online advertising.29

Undeterred by the above shortcomings of campaigning online, campaign managers continue to invest an increasing amount of their funds into digital operations. In 2014, total digital political ad spending was $71 million, and in 2016, the amount ballooned to $1.8 billion. Investments online are expected to continue to skyrocket into the 2018 midterm and 2020 primary elections.30 The Sanders campaign’s effective use of digital fundraising and advertising allowed for the unknown upstart candidate to effectively challenge the established frontrunner throughout the 2016 Democratic Primary. This success has made Revolution Messaging in high demand by progressives hoping to influence the upcoming 2018 midterms.31 2016 also marked the first time a presidential campaign spent more on digital advertising than traditional advertising, as Trump’s campaign spent as much as 50 percent to Hillary Clinton’s roughly 30 percent.32 Recognizing the role Parscale and his “mumbo-jumbo” digital operation played in his 2016 victory, Trump came around to the importance that webheads play in elections and appointed Parscale to be his campaign manager in 2020.33

The ultimate outcome of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica-Russia-Mueller story will make good fodder for Washington political reporters and pundits and, course, lawyers. But for today’s campaign managers in the field, it won’t really make a difference in how they do their jobs (beyond keeping their campaign servers secure as possible.) Modern political campaigns are about so much more than Facebook. It can be valuable, but it is just one of many platforms and tools used by campaign managers across paid and free communications, fundraising, field organizing, event production, research and other campaign functions. Savvy campaign managers will continue to use all digital and traditional tools at their disposal in an effort to reach voters and win elections.

# Discussion Questions

1. Currently, the primary method by which political campaigns target voters using digital advertising is through Facebook. As voters continue to consume media in a variety of different outlets aside from television, digital advertising will continue to increase in importance. What do you think will be the most important digital platforms in 2020?
2. Will there still be a role for television in four to eight years? Why do campaigns still spend so much money on television?
3. Are you targeted for campaign ads on Facebook or another platform? Have those ads targeted toward you gotten your “politics” correct?

# Appendix B Bubble Charts: How Campaigns Use Consumer Research Data to Understand Voters

**S**ophisticated and well-funded campaigns—including both Clinton’s and Trump’s in 2016—often use syndicated consumer research data to better understand voter demographics and behaviors.1 Campaigns look at what the syndicated data say about how voters consume television, digital, radio, and print media in order to target their advertising. Beyond media, examining voters’ other consumer behaviors (e.g., beverage preferences, automobile ownership) can give political marketers a broader understanding of the electorate. We have found students in our classes interested in these consumer data that provoke lively discussions as students consider questions such as “Why do Mini owners tend to be Democrats?” (see Figure B.11) or “Who is more likely to drink diet soft drinks, Democrats or Republicans, and why?” (see Figure B.8).2

The following nine bubble charts were prepared by the Washington Media Scholars Foundation for use in their 2018 undergraduate scholarship competition; the authors appreciate their permission to include them here.3 Most of the source data come from annual surveys by the Nielsen Scarborough research company that each year conducts lengthy interviews—including questions about partisanship and voting—with a very large sample size of more than 200,000 Americans over the age of eighteen.4 By comparison, typical telephone polls commissioned by campaigns are limited to sample sizes of 300 to 1,500 because of the high cost of completing and processing interviews.5

Both Clinton and Trump used Nielsen Scarborough media data in 2016, according to our interviews with their campaign media buyers. The large Nielsen Scarborough sample sizes enable campaigns and their media consultants to get a detailed picture of voter media behaviors within individual media markets as we showed in Chapter 7]] (see Figure 7.1]]). In this example, the campaign’s media insights were based on 2,708 interviews in the West Palm Beach, Florida, media market. By comparison, a privately commissioned statewide Florida poll with 1,000 total respondents would yield a sample size of only 100 to 110 interviews in the West Palm Beach market, home to 10.6 percent of Florida’s population.

Another data source used here comes from GfK MRI, which annually conducts “The Survey of the American Consumer.” This survey’s sample size of approximately 50,000 adults is smaller than Nielsen Scarborough’s, but the GfK MRI questionnaire is much longer and more extensive, measuring over 6,000 brand and media preferences.6 GfK MRI is the industry-accepted standard in the measurement of magazine readership (as we show in Figure B.7). Like Nielsen Scarborough, the GfK MRI survey includes questions about frequency of voting in presidential, statewide, and local elections and a question about party identification.7

# How to Read the Bubble Charts

Political candidates are very different from consumer brands; the GEICO gecko never disagrees with his brand manager, whereas candidates and their campaign managers often have differences of opinion. However, some useful research analogies can be drawn between consumer brand marketing and political marketing. Two of the most important attributes for consumer marketers are consumption level (e.g., how much soda does someone drink?) and brand preference (e.g., do they prefer Coke or Pepsi?). If we consider voters to be consumers of politics, then consumption level becomes frequency of voting and brand preference becomes partisanship, as shown in Figure B.1.

![[79.jpeg]]

Figure B.1 Political Consumption Level = Voter Turnout Frequency Political Brand Preference = Closer to Democratic or Republican

We can use this turnout-partisanship voter space to politically profile different voter media and consumer behaviors as we show in the following nine bubble charts. To understand the simple statistics behind these bubble charts, we use the example of MSNBC cable viewers shown in Figure B.3. Our bubble charts are based on index scores. Index scores are a shorthand way for researchers to compare a subgroup to the overall population. (The index score for the overall population is always 100.) The subgroup we examine is the 11 percent of adults who told Nielsen Scarborough that they had watched MSNBC in the past seven days. The size of the MSNBC bubble in Figure B.3 (Cable Networks Watched Past Seven Days) is proportionate to the 11 percent weekly audience size. Our MSNBC bubble’s vertical and horizontal coordinates are determined as follows:

- **The bubble chart’s vertical Y axis** measures voter turnout as an index score based on the percentage of MSNBC voters who say they “always vote” in “statewide elections.” As described in Figure B.3, MSNBC viewers have a voter turnout index score of 140, which is one of the highest for any cable channel.
- **The bubble chart’s horizontal X axis** measures party identification from left (Democratic) to right (Republican). As described in Figure B.2, the value on the X axis is the difference between the MSNBC viewer index score for Democrats/Democrat leaners and the score for Republicans/Republican leaners. Democrats are much more likely to watch MSNBC—the channel’s 89-point Democratic skew is one of the largest for any of the cable channels, as shown in Figure B.3.8

# Appendix C A Case Study Exercise in Campaign Media Planning

_**T**his fictional case study exercise is based on a case used by the Washington Media Scholars Foundation in its annual undergraduate scholarship competitions. It can be completed as a class assignment individually or in groups of two or three who then present their two-month campaign plans to the management of the Pacific City Cultural Association._1

# Pacific City Cultural Association (B)

You are the twenty-three-year-old media director of the Pacific City Cultural Association, a not-for-profit organization that promotes museums and performing arts institutions in one of the country’s largest media markets. You have worked for the PCCA since graduating from Pacific City College with a major in marketing communications and a minor in art history.

A bipartisan bill has been introduced in the Pacific City Council that would fund needed infrastructure improvements at PCCA museums and performance venues. PCCA management wants to improve attendance and increase arts supporter awareness of the PCCA as the Pacific City Council begins to consider increased arts funding. Last week, a group of local arts patrons—including members of a prominent PCCA donor family who own a number of media properties in the Pacific City market—offered the PCCA a gift of $1,800,000 in donated free advertising for a two-month campaign to drive attendance and awareness. You have been asked by the PCCA’s executive director to recommend how the $1,800,000 advertising budget should be allocated among the nine types of media vehicles donated for the two-month campaign.

## The Pacific City Cultural Association

Established in 1954, the PCCA was created to foster the development of cultural attractions in fast-growing Pacific City. Today, the PCCA’s small staff serves as a coordinating communications hub for the numerous cultural institutions that serve the metropolitan area. According to the PCCA’s market research, about 3.6 million adults (eighteen years and older) or 26.5 percent of all adults have visited at least one museum or attended a performance in the past twelve months.

## The PCCA Advertising Campaign

Your task is to present a recommendation for allocating the $1,800,000 value of the campaign across the nine media vehicles where time and space are being made available to the PCCA advertising campaign. Although all time and space is being donated, you want to use the market cost of the donated media to help guide your decisions about the media mix in your campaign.

As a cost yardstick, a PCCA colleague has prepared a table showing “cost per thousand impressions” for each of the nine media. Sometimes “impressions” are also called “exposures” or “opportunities to see.” Your estimated cost per thousand impressions ranges from a low of five dollars for transit advertising to a high of forty-nine dollars for print ads in the major metropolitan daily newspapers.

Using consumer research available to the PCCA, you’ve estimated the percentage of media audiences who are likely to be your target “culture consumers,” the 26.5 percent of adults who visit museums or attend performing arts venues. For example, on National Public Radio, culture consumers make up 53 percent of the audience, whereas culture consumers are only 26 percent of the audience on prime-time television shows such as _Wheel of Fortune_.

## Your PCCA Media Plan

You have prepared an Excel spreadsheet to assist you in allocating the $1,800,000 campaign budget across the nine media vehicles. (Student note: The following spreadsheet and other resources can be accessed at the authors’ website: [https://insidecampaignsbook.com](https://insidecampaignsbook.com\).) As a starting point, you have allocated $200,000 to each of the nine media vehicles. Your spreadsheet is designed to recalculate all values as you change the dollar amounts in the gray-shaded column.

![[91.jpeg]]

![[92.jpeg]]

Your goal is to maximize the number of culture consumer impressions (Column H) by changing the dollar amounts in Column A and playing “what if?” while using your judgment regarding the appropriate mix of the nine media. The PCCA executive director has told you that it is not necessary to use all of the nine media.

Before beginning to try different scenarios, you should familiarize yourself with the underlying formulae in the spreadsheet by clicking on different cells to see how the values are calculated. For example, culture consumers make up 30.9 percent of the audience for late-night television programs as shown in Column D—this is slightly higher than the 26.5 percent incidence of culture consumers in the total Pacific City population. This is reflected in Column E, which shows a culture consumer media index of 116—index values above 100 indicate that a media vehicle is more likely to reach culture consumers. In other words, late-night television audiences are 16 percent more likely than the average Pacific City adult to be culture consumers.

A late-night television budget of $200,000 with an average cost per thousand impressions of seventeen dollars (Column C) gives us a total of 11,764,706 estimated impressions with adults eighteen years and older (Column G). Because we know that, on average, 30.9 percent of these impressions will be with culture consumers, our spreadsheet estimates that we will achieve a total of 3,635,294 impressions with our target culture consumers (Column H) on late-night television.

In Columns J and K, we see that late-night television currently accounts for 10 percent of our total impressions with culture consumers and is 11 percent of our total media budget. Our average cost for reaching culture consumers on late-night television is fifty-five dollars per thousand culture consumer impressions (Column L). These figures will change as you manipulate dollar amounts in Column A.

As indicated, you have allocated an equal $200,000 to each of the nine media. At the bottom of the table you see that this yields a total number of adult impressions of 111,957,450. Comparing our adult impressions to the adult population of 13,593,000, we see that our impressions are equal to 824 percent of the adult population—in media math, this means we have achieved 824 gross ratings points (GRPs) among adults. Among our target culture consumers, however, we have achieved a higher 968 GRP level. An effective media plan will have a target GRP level that is higher than the overall adult GRP level.

## Your PCCA Media Plan Briefing

PCCA management is expecting the following:

1. The Excel spreadsheet with your recommended allocation of the $1,800,000 budget. Make sure that your name and contact information appear on the spreadsheet where indicated.
2. A document file, no longer than two pages single spaced, in which you answer the following questions in support of your media mix allocations. If you desire, the document may include tables or/and charts.
    1. What media received the largest shares of your budget, and why? What media received the smallest shares, and why?
    2. Beyond maximizing the number of culture consumer impressions, what were other factors you took into consideration when determining your recommended media mix?
    3. If the PCCA could solicit the donation of other types of media, what other media vehicles would you like to see included in your plan?

# Appendix D A Case Study in Crisis Management

**I**n Chapter 9]], Spinmeister, readers met rookie campaign manager Mark Block, who helmed Herman Cain’s ill-fated 2012 presidential effort. Here we tell the story of Cain’s implosion in detail. Was there anything Block and Cain could have done differently in order to salvage a viable campaign? Or was there no way forward?

# The Audacity of Smoke

## The Rise and Fall of the Unorthodox Herman Cain Campaign

The story of Mark Block, a first-time campaign manager running Herman Cain’s bid for the 2012 Republican nomination, offers lessons on both how campaigns succeed and how they fail.

Block had signed on with an improbable long shot, a businessman and former radio host with a booming voice and the ability to capture a crowd but with no actual electoral experience, save a failed bid for a US Senate seat in which he was little more than an afterthought. Now Herman Cain believed he could be president of the United States of America—and Cain wanted Block to get him there.

Cain started out as an asterisk in the polls. In debates, when the candidates were arranged by their poll numbers with the leaders in the middle, Cain appeared all the way on the left or right, nearly offstage. But Cain’s dogged devotion to a simple, easy-to-remember sound bite—simplify the tax code by levying a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent capital gains tax, and a 9 percent federal sales tax—started winning him fans and admirers. In a whack-a-mole primary campaign in which seemingly every candidate enjoyed a brief moment in the sun, Cain’s time came in late October 2011, just as Governor Rick Perry from Texas watched his numbers start to tank.

# Mark Block Goes Viral

Sometime around Halloween in 2011, Mark Block temporarily became one of the best-known campaign managers in America. His candidate, Herman Cain, had been at the bottom of the national surveys ten months before. Now as Cain found himself in a statistical dead heat with front-runner Mitt Romney for the Republican presidential nomination, an in-house video posted on Cain’s website went viral on YouTube.1 Within ten days, 1 million people had tuned in so they could catch the closing shot of the fifty-seven-year-old Block taking an ad-libbed drag on a Marlboro Light.

The video, originally envisioned as a pep talk for Cain volunteers, helped bring an unexpected $3 million influx of online contributions to the low-budget operation.2 Some now dubbed the high-momentum campaign the “Cain Train,” and Block was the engineer.

Like most campaign managers surveyed, Block preferred to leave the job of talking to the press to the campaign’s small communications staff. He had remained largely behind the scenes and out of the news since January 2011, when he signed on as manager.3

But Block’s anonymity went up in smoke on October 19 when the surging Cain campaign posted a sixty-second video featuring Block titled “Now is the time for action!” on the official campaign website. Looking directly into the camera in close-up, Block said, “We’ve run a campaign like no one has ever seen” and urged Cain supporters to get involved.4 It looked like any other inexpensively produced campaign video intended to recruit and motivate volunteers and donors—except for the cigarette used to punctuate his pitch in the final frames. Block took a drag and then exhaled into the camera. The unexpected juxtaposition of smoking and presidential politics made the video instant fodder for cable news networks and a media hungry for a race. Not only did their coverage drive more people online to watch Block smoke his cigarette, but it drove still more press coverage. Reporters and the bookers who arrange appearances on television and radio shows were nearly as interested in talking to the star of the “Smoking Man” video as they were in talking to his candidate. Block was suddenly making news, something that most campaign managers assiduously avoid. In the ten days after the video was released, ninety-two news stories ran about Block, according to a search of the Nexis news database; over the previous nine months, there had been only seven.5

To Democrats, Cain and his campaign manager were just another sideshow, an unexpected challenge, a welcome one to Democrats, that the front-running Republican Romney had to deal with. “If that guy wasn’t drunk, I haven’t taken a drink in my life,” said James Carville on ABC’s _Good Morning America_. “He was drunk or stoned. Some kind of chemical, I guarantee you that.”6 (Block maintains that he doesn’t drink.)

But many conservative commentators admired the video’s blatant disregard for political correctness. Describing Block’s performance as “accidental brilliance,” nationally syndicated columnist Kathleen Parker wrote, “Herman Cain’s craggy-faced chief of staff Mark Block took a drag off a cigarette, blew smoke at the camera, and sent the political class into coughing fits.”7 No one thought Cain would be the Republican nominee—but his campaign had somehow struck viral gold, using little more than a cloud of cigarette smoke.

Looking back, Block agreed that the video’s success was accidental. “[We] didn’t go out there saying, ‘Hey, let’s make this smoking video and see whether we can get more press.’ It just happened.”8 After staying behind the camera for months, Block began appearing on cable news to explain the video. He told CNN the Cain campaign’s fundraising total had jumped to $3 million in October, in part because of the video: “That’s what we’re seeing in our grassroots activism growth and obviously in the YouTube thing.”9 In an interview with the Fox News Channel, Block said the following:

> I tell you, you walk into a veterans’ bar in Iowa, and they’re sitting around smoking and you know we are resonating with them. I’m not the only one that smokes in America for God’s sake. It was a choice I made, and it was at the end of the ad. The real message that we’re trying to get through was the Cain train is on a roll.10

It’s not clear how many of those patrons of a veterans’ bar in Iowa were clicking through YouTube. But a new generation of libertarian Republicanism was on the rise, and Cain had tapped a vein.

![[93.jpeg]]

**The audacity of smoke.** Mark Block, manager of Herman Cain’s presidential campaign, smokes in the last few seconds of a video posted by the Cain campaign on October 19, 2011. The video set off a media frenzy and went viral with nearly 1 million views in ten days.

Herman Cain for President, 2012.

The video was produced on October 19, the day after a Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas. The Cain campaign team was still in town at the Wynn hotel on the Las Vegas strip. Traveling with them was the campaign’s videographer, Chris Burgard, who produced short videos of Cain for the campaign’s website. Block says the campaign had been talking for some time about the need to produce a video of him addressing Cain’s supporters online about the campaign’s surging momentum.

The Internet had been a key tool for the relatively low-budget, grassroots-directed Cain campaign. Curious voters had been flocking to Cain’s website after seeing or hearing one of his many media appearances in which he talked about his tax plan—“9-9-9,” in his oft-repeated baritone.

Cain could be an entertaining interview and had been invited as a guest on the late-night talk shows hosted by David Letterman and Jay Leno, where he reached new audiences outside the television news box. “We had a standing invitation to appear on just about every television show,” Block said. He added that Cain wanted to appear at least once on as many shows as possible.11 This differed sharply from the approach of Mitt Romney, the other front-runner for the Republican nomination, who accepted only a small number of national media requests and focused more on local media in the early primary states.

Block’s smoking at the end of the video was a spur-of-the-moment decision on the recommendation of videographer Burgard. Before the edited video was posted to the campaign’s official website, it was circulated for approval by Cain and top campaign staff. “No one said, ‘Take out the smoking,’” remembered Block.12 After the video was launched on the website, early reactions from Cain supporters were negative, and some members of the field team urged that the video be taken down.

But the campaign staffers closest to the volunteers, the lifeblood of any presidential campaign, had a different take: “After about twenty-four to forty-eight hours, it began to turn around, and our people became very positive on the video,” said Block. As more and more people came to the campaign website to watch it—with many lingering on the site to register or contribute—the campaign’s servers were overwhelmed and crashed. Ironically, the popularity of the smoking video was costing the campaign money by slowing down the website, said Block, who then decided to post the video on YouTube. The campaign’s internal servers were then able to process more volunteer sign-ups and campaign contributions.13

As Block claimed in the video, the Cain campaign was on a roll by the end of October. Just eight weeks earlier, Cain was averaging only 4.8 percent in national primary trial heats, well behind Rick Perry’s 26.3 percent and Romney’s 16.5 percent. But as Perry’s support collapsed to 10.5 percent, largely because of widespread media coverage of his debate gaffes, Cain and Block were glad to pick up the slack. By Halloween, Cain had surged to 25 percent nationally, into a statistical dead heat with Romney’s 24.3 percent.14

Apparently, Cain’s “campaign like no one has ever seen” was working. Block was now managing a front-running campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. “Only in America,” said Block.15

# Mark Block, Chief Operating Officer and Chief of Staff

As the engineer of the speeding Cain Train, the fifty-seven-year-old Block was indeed an unlikely choice to manage a major presidential campaign.16 “Most of the people that are running presidential campaigns don’t act like I act,” said an understated Block in an October 30 in-depth profile on the front page of the Sunday print edition of the _Milwaukee Journal Sentinel_, his hometown newspaper.17

Block had been in politics all his life, but he was a newcomer to presidential politics. His previous experience was largely limited to state and local races in his native Wisconsin. He was not the typical campaign hired gun but owed his position at the top of the Cain organization to his close personal and political relationship with the candidate. Block met Cain in 2005 while Block was running the Wisconsin chapter of a national free markets advocacy organization, Americans for Prosperity, funded by the conservative billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch. Block described how he and Cain got to know one another:

> I had just become the state director of Americans for Prosperity grassroots organization in Wisconsin. Wisconsin became the fourth state chapter of Americans for Prosperity. . . . And Mr. Herman Cain was here to help launch chapters. I brought him into Wisconsin. I think we did like nine meetings around the state in a two-and-a-half day time frame. And that was the beginning, and then Americans for Prosperity asked me to open up Michigan and Ohio. So I had brought Cain into those states and spent a lot of time in a car driving around those states. So if you can imagine, if you spend time in a car with somebody, you get to know him pretty well. And we became pretty good friends.
> 
> As we traveled those six, five years ago, almost every time he spoke, people would say, “You got to run for president. You got to run for president,” so we talked at great length about it, but then two things happened. He got cancer and then obviously pulled out from everything he was doing just to fight for his life. And the second thing is the growth of Americans for Prosperity throughout the United States.
> 
> So fast-forward then four years, and Americans for Prosperity’s now in thirty-two states. He beat cancer and put some serious thought into running for president. If Cain had run in 2004, for example, he wouldn’t have had the contacts throughout the country into these grassroots organizations or Tea Party groups, which was really one of the strengths of the organization. One of the things that the press never picked up on, and we didn’t want to really let the media know, was that we had incredible grassroots organizations in all fifty states.18

Campaign managers surveyed for this book say a key trait of a successful manager is the ability to earn and hold the complete trust of the candidate. As a testament to his faith in Block, Cain said he talked to three people before deciding to enter the presidential race in January 2011: “My wife, my minister, and Mark Block.”19 The bond of trust between Cain and Block was about to be tested by events that began to unfold on Sunday, October 30, the same day Block’s profile ran on the front page of the _Milwaukee Journal Sentinel_.

# From Campaign Manager to Crisis Manager

That day, Cain was in Washington, D.C., at the bureau of CBS News, the lone guest on _Face the Nation_. Accompanying the candidate in the preinterview green room were Mrs. Cain, Block, and J. D. Gordon, the campaign’s vice president of communications. Although the actual viewing audiences are relatively small for Sunday morning programs such as _Face the Nation_, _Meet the Press_ (NBC), and _This Week_ (ABC), the programs are closely watched by the political intelligentsia and the media. They serve as trials by fire, tests of a candidate’s command of the issues and ability to survive intense lines of questioning from the network’s hosts. They have an ability to shape the direction of follow-up news coverage that will reach tens of millions of potential voters that few other television shows can claim to match. Appearing on these programs is a major undertaking for presidential candidates, who typically prepare by studying briefing books and participating in mock interviews.

Block said the campaign had accepted the interview three days earlier, a Thursday: “Mr. Cain had been on the program before but not as the only guest.” Block recalls that no special preparations were made for Cain’s appearance, although a few members of the staff did sit down with him a couple of hours before the interview to discuss the latest news and issue briefing papers that the campaign prepared for Cain on a daily basis.20 From 1991 to early 2015, the host of _Face the Nation_ was Bob Schieffer, a seventy-four-year-old, highly respected veteran newsman who is known for having a less confrontational style than many younger television news interviewers. What Cain and Block did not know was that Schieffer is a survivor of bladder cancer who believes smoking is dangerous. They also did not know that Schieffer planned to open the broadcast with the Smoking Man video. After a few quick questions about Cain’s “9-9-9” tax plan, Schieffer played the video and pounced.

Schieffer: Mr. Cain, I just have to ask you, what is the point of that, having a man smoke a cigarette in a television commercial, for you?

Cain: One of the themes within this campaign is let Herman be Herman. Mark Block is a smoker, and we say let Mark be Mark. That’s all we’re trying to say, because we believe let people be people. He doesn’t deny that he’s a smoker. This isn’t trying—

Schieffer: Are you a smoker?

Cain: No, I’m not a smoker. But I don’t have a problem if that’s his choice. So let Herman be Herman; let Mark be Mark. Let people be people. This wasn’t intended to send any subliminal signal whatsoever.

Schieffer: But it does. It sends a signal that it’s cool to smoke.

Cain: No, it does not. Mark Block smokes. That’s all that ad says. We weren’t trying to say it’s cool to smoke. You have a lot of people in this country that smoke. But what I respect about Mark as a smoker, who is my chief of staff, he never smokes around me or smokes around anyone else. He goes outside.

Schieffer: Well, he smokes on television.

Cain: Well, he smokes on television. But there was no other subliminal message.

Schieffer: Was it meant to be funny?

Cain: It was meant to be informative. If they listen to the message where he said America has never seen a candidate like Herman Cain—that was the main point of it. And the bit on the end, we didn’t know whether it was going to be funny to some people or whether they were going to ignore it or whatever the case may be.

Schieffer: Well, let me just tell you, it’s not funny to me. I am a cancer survivor like you.

Cain: Right, I am also.

Schieffer: I had cancer that’s smoking related.

Cain: Yes.

Schieffer: I don’t think it serves the country well—and this is an editorial opinion here—to be showing someone smoking a cigarette. And you’re the front-runner now. And it seems to me, as front-runner, you would have a responsibility not to take that kind of a tone in this campaign. I would suggest that perhaps, as the front-runner, you’d want to raise the level of the campaign.

Cain: We will do that, Bob. And I do respect your objection to the ad. And probably about 30 percent of the feedback was very similar to yours. It was not intended to offend anyone. And being a cancer survivor myself, I am sensitive to that sort of thing.

Schieffer: Would you take the ad down?

Cain: Well, it’s on the Internet. We didn’t run it on TV.

Schieffer: Why don’t you take it off the Internet?

Cain: It’s impossible to do now. Once you put it on the Internet, it goes viral. We could take it off of our website, but there are other sites that have already picked it up. It’s nearly impossible to erase that ad from the Internet.

Schieffer: Have you ever thought of just saying to young people, “Don’t smoke; 400,000 people in America die every year from smoking-related—”

Cain: I will have no problem saying that. And as a matter of fact—

Schieffer: Well, say it right now.

Cain: Young people of America, all people, do not smoke. It is hazardous, and it’s dangerous to your health. Don’t smoke. I’ve never smoked, and I have encouraged people not to smoke.

Schieffer: And it’s not a cool thing to do.

Cain: It is not a cool thing to do. And that’s not what it was trying to say. Smoking is not a cool thing to do.21

The exchange between Schieffer and Cain became the news-making sound bite from the interview and was featured that Sunday evening on network television newscasts, along with clips of Block smoking. But the real news was about to be made after the interview as Cain was leaving the CBS bureau. On the sidewalk, he was confronted by Jonathan Martin, at the time a top reporter for _Politico_, a national political news outlet.

“Have you ever been accused, sir, in your life of harassment by a woman?” asked Martin.22 According to Martin’s story, “[Cain] breathed audibly, glared at the reporter and stayed silent for several seconds. After the question was repeated three times, he responded by asking the reporter, ‘Have you ever been accused of sexual harassment?’”23 In fact, Martin had contacted Cain’s campaign several times in the previous days asking for comment on a tip claiming that Cain had been forced to settle complaints of inappropriate behavior when he was president of the National Restaurant Association from late 1996 to mid-1999. Martin had been holding the story while waiting for the Cain campaign’s response to _Politico_’s inquiries. Frustrated, he made a spur of the moment decision that Sunday morning to drive over to CBS and ask Cain in person. When Martin told Cain the name of one of the women involved, Cain would only respond, “I have no comment on that.” Cain returned to his vehicle and left for his hotel with his wife, Block, and a few campaign staffers.

Block remembered that the conversation in the car was less about Martin’s questions than about Schieffer’s ambush on the Smoking Man video. “We were all saying, ‘What was that all about?’” recalled Block. The campaign had known Martin was working on a story but hadn’t known exactly what the story would be. “They had been asking us for comment but would not tell us exactly what information they had or where it came from,” said Block. Block thought Martin and _Politico_ had a strong liberal bias and were working on a “typical liberal media hit piece” on Cain (Block hadn’t known that Martin had worked in Republican politics before becoming a journalist).24

The campaign had not prepared a response plan: “We couldn’t prepare our response until we saw what they had,” said Block.25 The Cain campaign did not have to wait long. That evening at 8:00 p.m., Martin and his investigating team published their exclusive story.26 By the following morning, no one would care anymore about Block and his smoking.

Cain had a full schedule of media appearances planned, beginning with a stop at the National Press Club, just a few blocks from the White House. Block also had committed to several interviews on cable news channels. The fallout from _Politico_’s story was only beginning to build, as other news organizations raced to confirm the details and add new tidbits of their own. Now the question was whether Cain and his campaign should go ahead with their media schedule.

There is but one avenue of recourse: Take control of the story by releasing all of the damaging details as quickly as possible. While developing their crisis response, most campaign managers would have curtailed their candidate’s media appearances, particularly avoiding news interviews where anchors and reporters would certainly be asking questions about a fast-developing story. But this conventional approach was not the chosen approach for the unconventional Cain, who made the decision himself: The Cain campaign would not go into crisis mode; it would continue with its planned events.

“Herman decided he was going to do the Press Club and keep his full schedule of media interviews,” Block told us, adding that he agreed with the boss’s decision.27 After all, the free media had been good so far for Cain and his low-budget campaign, according to Block.28 The charismatic Cain was a good interview and in constant demand with bookers. The Cain campaign almost never declined a media invitation; talking mostly about his “9-9-9” tax plan, Cain was garnering tens of millions of free and largely favorable impressions with Republican voters. Now, Cain and Block decided not to run away from the media but to turn up the volume and blast their way through the charges of inappropriate sexual behavior.

# Making News in Real Time

It was Halloween—Monday, October 31, 2011. By the time evening trick-or-treating had started, Cain and Block found themselves at the center of a full-fledged national media feeding frenzy, a situation neither man had been in before.

“Get all the bad news out quickly” is a mantra frequently repeated by most of the campaign managers we surveyed. But that’s not what Cain and Block seemed to be doing. Even worse, it seemed like Cain’s campaign didn’t have a full grasp of the facts—or that they were intentionally downplaying the seriousness of the charges and omitting key details. In a series of appearances and media interviews, the campaign’s versions of events kept evolving, which, in turn, generated an explosive chain reaction: As other news outlets chased _Politico_’s scoop, wave after wave of new, damaging stories about the accusations against Cain came to dominate the race. Although a full recounting is beyond the scope of this case study, here are some key highlights as the story blew up during the first week.

- **Monday afternoon (October 31):** On Fox News, Cain told an interviewer that allegations were made against him but insisted he “never sexually harassed anyone.” Cain said the National Restaurant Association investigated the charges and found them to be “baseless.” He said no cash settlements were made, adding that if the association did give any money, “I wasn’t even aware of it.”
- **Monday evening:** Back on Fox, this time with Greta Van Susteren, Cain retreated from his claim earlier in the day that no settlements were offered. He now said there was one “agreement,” which he estimated to be two or three months’ worth of salary “well within the range of what we would do if there was an amicable separation between the association and an employee.” He wouldn’t say if the cash payment was a direct result of the allegations against him and insisted there was only one “agreement,” not two.
- **Tuesday morning (November 1):** Robin Meade, the morning news host on HLN (formerly Headline News), asked Cain to explain the discrepancy between his two statements on Monday about a “settlement.” Cain replied with a semantic distinction: “The word _settlement_ suggested to me some sort of legal settlement, and as I recalled what happened twelve years ago, I recalled an agreement. I wasn’t thinking legal settlement. And so the words have been a flyspeck, and I do recall an agreement.” Cain also charged _Politico_ with digging up the story to hurt his campaign while he was rising in the polls. He asked Meade, “Are you being used to try and help paint a cloud and help sabotage my candidacy?”
- **Tuesday afternoon:** Back on Fox News, Cain suggested he was being attacked because of his race. Although he said he had no evidence to support that suggestion, Cain told Charles Krauthammer that he may be the victim of a “high-tech lynching.” The _New York Times_ reported that at least one of the settlements totaled $35,000, or roughly the value of a year’s salary and substantially more than the two or three months’ pay Cain had suggested on Monday.
- **Wednesday (November 2):** A third woman said she considered filing a sexual harassment complaint, telling the Associated Press that Cain made sexually suggestive comments and invited her back to his apartment while she worked for him at the National Restaurant Association. Meanwhile, a Republican pollster—now working for Cain’s Republican primary opponent Rick Perry—said he personally witnessed Cain sexually harassing one of the two women who received settlements. The Cain campaign began suggesting that the Perry campaign was the source of the story. They noted that consultant Curt Anderson, who learned about the allegations when he worked on Cain’s unsuccessful 2004 Senate campaign, had joined the rival Perry campaign only one week before _Politico_ published its story.
- **Thursday (November 3):** _Politico_ reported that the second accuser received a payment of $45,000. The Cain campaign did not respond directly and continued to claim that they were the victim of an “appalling smear campaign” by “inside the Beltway media.” In an interview with Fox’s Megyn Kelly, Block appeared to back away from his accusation that Anderson had leaked the story to _Politico_. Kelly noted that Anderson had made several media appearances to defend himself, had only nice things to say about Cain, and denied providing any reporter with information about the sexual allegations. Block’s tone toward Anderson became conciliatory, but he continued to suggest the Perry campaign was culpable. Commenting on the interview, one media blogger wrote the following:

> [Block’s] appearance reasserts the growing concern among many political pundits that the more damning issue with this harassment story is not the pattern of behavior it may or may not suggest of the candidate, but in the inept handling of the allegations at every possible turn.29

- **Friday (November 4):** Block, again on Fox News, said he would no longer be answering questions about the sexual harassment complaints: “This is the last time that I’ll be addressing the issue.” Block also said the _Politico_ reporters who broke the story should be fired for poor journalism and hinted that the Cain campaign was discussing a lawsuit. The week before, Cain had dominated the news that came out of the Sunday talk shows. Now his campaign was again the central focus—but for exactly the wrong reason. Mississippi governor and former Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour said Cain might survive but must “get all the facts out as quickly as possible.” Other commentators are harsher. “He’s not going to be the nominee, if I can just be honest here. He was never going to be the nominee,” _Weekly Standard_ editor William Kristol said on _Fox News Sunday_. Ed Rollins, Michele Bachmann’s former campaign manager, told _Politico_ that it was over: “This guy knows nothing about foreign policy, ‘9-9-9’ has been ripped apart, the girl problem is not going away, and his beating up the media shows a thin skin that will get him in trouble. You combine that with no real campaign and his days are limited.”
- **Monday (November 7):** The first woman to use her name and tell her story in detail claimed that Cain attempted to put his hand up her skirt when she was seeking employment advice from him. Sharon Bialek, a registered Republican, said she had been an admirer of Cain while she worked at the educational foundation of the National Restaurant Association for nine years before she lost her job in 1997. When she asked Cain for advice on finding another position in the association, Cain invited her to dinner in Washington and then touched her afterward in Cain’s car. She claimed that when she asked him to stop, Cain told her, “You want a job, right?” The Cain campaign issued a statement: “All allegations of harassment against Mr. Cain are completely false. Mr. Cain has never harassed anyone.” That night, Cain told late-night comedy show host Jimmy Kimmel, “The feelings that you have [when] you know that all of this is totally fabricated—you go from anger, then you get disgusted.”30
- **Tuesday (November 8):** Karen Kraushaar, one of the two anonymous women in the original _Politico_ story, went public. Kraushaar, who received a $45,000 settlement payment, is highly credible—a graduate of Brown with a master’s degree from the University of Michigan who now works as a communications professional at the Treasury Department. She suggested that she and three other women jointly hold a press conference.31 Block appeared on Fox and said that the Cain campaign has confirmed that Kraushaar’s son works at _Politico_—another claim that turned out to be false.32 Cain’s campaign went from a front-running position to a disastrous spiral, one that virtually guaranteed he—and the allegations against him—would be the focus of every cable channel and political reporter in the country. If they could, Block and the Cain campaign needed to break the 24/7 news cycle in which they found themselves trapped. In an effort to do so, they added well-known celebrity attorney Lin Wood to their team and called a press conference—Cain’s first since the _Politico_ story broke—for Tuesday, November 8.33

Lin introduced Cain at the late-afternoon event at the Scottsdale Plaza Resort. Cain said the charges against him were false, and he blamed the Democratic Party. “The Democrat machine in America has brought forth a troubled woman to make accusations, many of which exceed common sense,” he said. “And they certainly exceed the standards of decency in America.” Cain suggested he might be willing to take a lie detector test and vowed to stay in the race. “We are not going to allow Washington or politics to deny me the opportunity to represent this great nation,” Cain said. “As far as these accusations to cause me to back off or maybe withdraw from this primary race, [that] ain’t going to happen. I’m doing this for the American people and for their children and their grandchildren.”34 Campaign managers faced with harshly negative stories about their candidates almost universally told us that getting the facts out quickly—and completely—is essential. A one-week story is survivable; a monthlong story filled with dribs and drabs of extra information allows reporters covering the campaign to rehash the initial bad news again and again, reminding voters of the story while undermining a campaign’s credibility with important influencers, in the media and the community. Whether or not _Politico_ had an agenda in pursuing claims about Cain’s behavior toward women—and few observers outside the Cain campaign thought the paper had any such agenda—the facts told a story all their own. Cain’s campaign lost valuable oxygen—and their front-runner position—by sticking to a story they should have known was unsustainable.

As it turned out, Cain would stay in the race for only twenty-four more days. After the press conference, and with no new accusers coming forward, it initially appeared that the Cain Train might be able to get moving again. “I think if you go back [to the press conference], the story did begin to wane from that point forward. We were attempting to get back on message, and the message was the ‘9-9-9’ economic vision for America,” recalled Block.35 But the story came back with a vengeance on November 28 when an Atlanta businesswoman, Ginger White, told a local television station that she had carried on a thirteen-year affair with Cain. Instead of waiting ten days as they did after the first accusations, the Cain campaign reacted immediately and issued a denial before the story aired. Block described what happened next and how Cain reached the decision to end his presidential bid:

> On Monday evening, [Ginger White] was going to break the story. We had been alerted to it. I had made a strong recommendation to Mr. Cain that he address the issue on Wolf Blitzer’s show in the afternoon to get out in front of the story. But as the week drew on, a couple of things became apparent. One, that it was causing great consternation to his family. And Mr. Cain really does put his family first. Number two, what we hadn’t seen with the _Politico_ story, it was affecting our donations online, which is a real-time indication of your support. The polling showed that we were dropping, but more importantly, as we assessed the situation, it continued [to drop].
> 
> Every time that he had an interview, every time that he did a TV appearance, everywhere that he went, he would be asked the same questions over and over again. And it was really death by 1,000 cuts. So can you sustain that and still win the nomination? And as you start putting together the pros and cons, it became apparent that you probably could survive this one. But if it continued and the press was going to continue to do this, that winning the nomination wasn’t going to happen.
> 
> From a businessman’s perspective, Mr. Cain looked at it and said, “We have enough cash on hand to make it through Iowa and into New Hampshire. But if our fundraising dries up, we’ll be broke, and we’ll not accomplish what I set out to do.” And I think that was part of the strong family decision, [and] why he made the decision to suspend the campaign.36

In the days following White’s Monday revelation, the Cain campaign went into public “reassessment” mode. Enthusiastic crowds of supporters still greeted Cain at campaign events and urged him not to quit, but it was increasingly clear that the campaign was now in dire straits. The _Des Moines Register_ released a poll of likely Iowa Republican caucus-goers showing that Cain had fallen to 8 percent just five weeks after leading the Republican pack with 23 percent at the end of October. Asked which candidate was most likely to have a scandal in the White House, a plurality of 47 percent named Cain. Beyond the sex scandal, the poll showed Cain was perceived as uninformed about issues—27 percent said he was the least knowledgeable candidate in the race. Only 8 percent said Cain was the candidate they would most like to meet in person.37

Managing the wrap-up of a “doomed” or losing campaign is a situation many managers face. As Cain and his top team deliberated, Block and others in the Cain camp publicly insisted that Cain would not drop out. “I don’t know where they’re getting their information,” said Cain spokesperson J. D. Gordon when asked about reports that Cain would exit the race. In Iowa, Block met with the state’s campaign team. “Mark Block, Herman Cain’s chief of staff and chief operating officer, just left a meeting at the Iowa headquarters with all four Iowa staffers,” said Lisa Lockwood, communications director for Friends of Herman Cain’s Iowa staff. “The emphatic message is that the campaign is full-steam ahead. Herman Cain is in it to win it. He always has been, and that has not changed.”38

The Cain campaign had earlier scheduled the opening of its larger new Atlanta headquarters for Saturday, December 3. Instead, joined on the stage by his wife and family, Cain used the ribbon-cutting event to “suspend” his unorthodox campaign just weeks after emerging as a national front-runner for his party’s presidential nomination. That day, Mark Block took himself off the payroll along with every other employee except for one bookkeeper to look after the roughly $200,000 surplus that would remain in the official committee account after paying all the bills.39

# Retrospective

“Victory has 1,000 fathers, but defeat is an orphan,” John Kennedy famously said after the 1961 Bay of Pigs debacle. James Carville put it another way: “You know, politics is a lot like being a pilot. You don’t get so much credit for doing things right, [but] son of a bitch, you get hurt doing things wrong.”40

When a political campaign fails, the manager must be braced to endure public blame and after-the-fact finger-pointing, whether deserved or not. Many political professionals felt Block deserved it and were heaping out the criticism before Cain even left the race. “The Eric Fehrnstroms and Dave Carneys of the world are pretty savvy on this stuff,” said Ty Matsdorf, spokesperson for the independent Democratic advocacy group American Bridge, referencing top staffers at the Romney and Perry campaigns. “I can’t imagine that their response strategy would have been the same as what Mark Block and Herman Cain have been doing.” Matsdorf said his group might have jumped in if the Romney or Perry campaigns had found themselves in trouble, but in Cain’s case it wasn’t necessary. “From our standpoint, to be totally honest with you, Herman Cain is doing our job for us,” Matsdorf said. “If our job is to highlight Republicans’ flip-flops or missteps—he’s doing it himself, so there’s not a lot of room for us to do anything even if we wanted to.”41

A few campaign managers speculated to us that Cain and Block were less than prepared for their crisis because they never expected their long-shot, low-budget presidential bid would find itself leading the field, at least not in October. They pointed to Block’s failure to build a traditional campaign organization as evidence that Cain never expected to win. “The campaign probably started out as a way to sell Cain’s speeches and books, raise his profile, and maybe get a gig on Fox News,” one told us.

“Bullshit,” said Block when asked about this characterization. Before Cain announced his long-shot candidacy, he and Block had prepared a written plan and budget that charted a way for Cain to win the nomination based on a bottom-up, grassroots campaign instead of the conventional top-down, hierarchical model. “The campaign plan was lifted off of _The Audacity to Win_,” said Block, referring to the book by David Plouffe, manager of the 2008 Obama presidential campaign. Their plan was smart and successful, insisted Block, pointing to Cain’s rise to the top of the national polls in October as evidence. Block is dismissive of his critics: “Have they ever run a campaign that went from nowhere to first in the national polls?”42

Block’s detractors say Cain wasted time with his visits to late-primary states like Tennessee and Alabama, instead of focusing on Iowa and New Hampshire. Again, answered Block, these critics did not understand how the Cain bottom-up campaign operated differently from traditional presidential campaigns. “We were running a national campaign,” said Block, who said they were targeting Tea Party sympathizers across the country and wanted to be the first to start grassroots organizations in as many different states as possible.43

> Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida, and Nevada were important. Contrary to what was written [in the press], we didn’t ignore those states. In fact, if you go back and take a look at how many times Cain visited those states versus the other candidates, we were second or third. The difference was we went into those states early and built a network of grassroots activists, stepped back, and said, “You know what? We pretty much got our act together there, so we’re going to go places where others haven’t been.”44

Candidate scheduling is usually strictly controlled by headquarters, but the low-budget Cain campaign schedule was determined differently, with more input from state campaign offices. “We had organizations in states that were raising money and could fund a bus trip into Tennessee and a bus trip into Alabama,” said Block.45

Block said much of the criticism of the Cain campaign comes from established political consultants and their friends in the media who did not understand Cain’s “unconventional” bottom-up organization. Block remains proud that the campaign hired no major political consultants or firms, not even a pollster. “One of the reasons that Rick Perry flamed out is that his consultants put so much crap in his head before the debates that he couldn’t process it all.”46 Block also faults Michele Bachmann’s professional management team, saying they took her from a first-place finish in the quadrennial August straw poll in Ames, Iowa, to a poor, campaign-ending performance in the January caucuses: “[You] see a transformation of Michele Bachmann from a pretty good candidate to a very controlled-by-consultants candidate.” Block said their campaign took the opposite approach: “We let Herman be Herman.”47

But traditional campaigns that follow well-trod paths win for a reason, and letting Herman be Herman may not have been the best way to manage a national real-time media feeding frenzy. Block conceded they could have employed some more conventional public relations tactics: “You know, probably in hindsight, when that [first sexual harassment] story broke on Sunday night, we probably should have held a press conference Monday morning and said that these are baseless accusations with no merit. That’s what we should have done. But again, we didn’t know at that point what the accusations were because Jonathan Martin didn’t give us anything.” Should Block have used their press spokesman as the primary first responder? “Good question. But I think it’s retrospective because Mr. Cain wanted to handle it all himself,” said Block.48

The campaign underestimated how overwhelming the story would become, admitted Block. No one can really prepare themselves for the fire hydrant of coverage when a big controversy takes hold in today’s accelerated 24/7 news cycle, he said. “Everything you say or do becomes news immediately.” Block remembered standing on a street corner in Washington when he got a call from a reporter on his cell phone. “What are you doing in town, is something up?” the reporter asked. “How did he know I was even there? He said someone had just seen me and sent it out on Twitter, so he called me. I couldn’t even stand on the street without hearing about it from the press,” said Block. The rapid back-and-forth caused the campaign to make some mistakes in haste, including some missteps of his own, said Block.49

Two mistakes cited by Block came when the Cain campaign attempted to “attack the messenger.” Block said the first was singling out Perry consultant Curt Anderson as _Politico_’s source on the sexual harassment story. “I did apologize to Anderson because he said on national news that he didn’t have anything to do with it,” said Block, although he still insists that the Perry camp was responsible: “We still have some pretty good information that Perry’s folks had their fingerprints on this.”50

In fact, Block was mistaken once again. Advisers close to Jon Huntsman, the former Utah governor and ambassador to China, eventually told journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann the Huntsman campaign had been behind the Cain story. After watching so many other candidates’—former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, then Bachmann, then Perry, then Cain—rise and fall, Huntsman’s team believed they would benefit from the fall of another also-ran.

Another mistake was falsely claiming that one of Cain’s accusers, Karen Kraushaar, had a son who was a _Politico_ reporter. Like the smoking video, this was a last-minute improvisation by Block. “It was like two minutes before I was going on the air that I was shown, on the Internet, that this gentleman had worked at _Politico_ and had the same last name of one of the women who had just come out,” said Block.51

> I’m thinking, _Let’s connect the dots here_. But it proved to be false. A bit of advice I would give anybody reading this [is to] make sure you’ve got your facts straight. It was quite embarrassing because I had just spent days telling the press that they should have their facts straight.52

Even if Block had spent the time getting his facts straight, it is doubtful whether any presidential campaign—conventional top-down or unconventional bottom-up—could have survived the accusations against Cain, Block believes. But he would do it all again and feels privileged for the rare opportunity to have run a presidential campaign.

> Here’s a poor boy from Weyauwega, Wisconsin, population 678, going to school at Weyauwega-Fremont High School, single mom on welfare, and then I get to be one of, what, a couple of hundred people in history to run a national [presidential] campaign? I say this in all sincerity—only in America can somebody from where I came from tell that story.53

# Case Teaching Topics

- Could Block and Cain have managed their way out of the controversy? Or were they unavoidably overwhelmed by events beyond the campaign’s control?
- Why have presidential candidates like Donald Trump and Bill Clinton been able to survive sex controversies whereas Cain could not?
- Overall, what’s your opinion about Block’s management of the Cain campaign (a) before October 30 and (b) after October 30? Did the campaign plan help Cain to the top of the national polls, or was it simply good luck after Perry’s poll numbers began to drop?
- What plan would you have recommended to Cain on the evening of October 30?
