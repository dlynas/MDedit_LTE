### The Cry for Justice]]

On Good Friday, April 12, 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr., was arrested, booked, and jailed in Birmingham, Alabama. He had violated a court’s injunction against marches during the battle to desegregate that city, a notorious bastion of racist terror. King was convinced that if the movement could triumph there, the walls of Southern segregation would crumble. While behind bars, he wrote the “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” At the very beginning, King declared, “Just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own hometown.”[^1]

Smarting from a recent setback in Albany, Georgia, and hungry for a civil rights victory, King had carried that gospel to Birmingham in early 1963. He had envisioned a massive campaign of nonviolent protest that would wield the leverage of an Easter season boycott to integrate Birmingham’s downtown stores. But with the insurgency faltering in the first weeks of April, King needed a dramatic stroke. He decided to court arrest. The authorities obliged and put him behind bars. While in jail, he read a statement in the local newspaper from eight local white clergymen, all self-described racial “moderates.” They branded King and his colleagues outsiders and extremists, rejected the demonstrations as untimely, and chided the protesters for precipitating violence. The “Letter” began as King’s retort to the clergymen.

For King’s closest colleagues, the “Letter” provided nothing less than the moral and philosophical foundations of their movement. Over the next fifty years, the stature of the “Letter” spread beyond the events that spawned it. It has been hailed as one of our nation’s literary treasures, compared with the Gettysburg Address and Émile Zola’s “J’Accuse,” and studied in countless college and high school classrooms. The “Letter” earned King a place alongside Gandhi and Thoreau as a champion of civil disobedience. The influence of its vision of nonviolent direct action rippled across the globe to insurgents in Soweto, Prague, and Beijing. King’s words—the bristling at those who tell the oppressed to “wait for a more convenient season,” the steely conviction of the irrepressible force of freedom in the world—have resonated among freedom fighters long after the “Letter” was written.

The “Letter’s” broad appeal pays homage to the universalist stance in King’s lofty opening: “I am in Birmingham because injustice exists here.” But King was also there because “my people,” as he often referred to fellow blacks, were suffering. King’s Christian faith in his Savior’s love for all God’s children suffuses the “Letter,” but its driving force is black pain and anger. Those twin imperatives match the larger duality of King’s life: action and argument, exhorting blacks and persuading whites. There was always a two-way flow between those two realms: The defiant purpose of the black uprising spilled into the “Letter”; the “Letter’s” arguments about iniquity and its remedy flowed back into mass meetings, freedom songs, and marches.

The Birmingham struggle gave rise to events that forever changed our nation. The _resources/books//Gospel of Freedom_ Martin Luther King, Jr. - Jonathan Rieder from those months in the spring and summer of 1963 are now an indelible part of our national history: the city’s black youth defying the fire hoses and dogs of policemen dispatched to maintain white supremacy; the movement’s leaders galvanizing the protest with rousing sermons and freedom songs like “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around”; President John Kennedy addressing the nation in June, finally defining civil rights as an urgent moral issue and national priority; and blacks and whites gathering at the Lincoln Memorial in August for the March on Washington to hear King deliver “I Have a Dream.”

The battle for civil rights was not finally won in the months King called the long “summer of our discontent.” The Civil Rights Act, which banned discrimination in public accommodations, was not passed until the following year. Black defiance continued to spread across America. Battles with names like St. Augustine and Selma—modern equivalents of Antietam, Gettysburg, and Bull Run—lay ahead. On September 15, 1963, in a racist revenge killing, the bombing of Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham took the lives of four little black girls. The white backlash was just gathering force in the North. Still, after Birmingham, the foundations of the nation’s old racial order cracked in some elemental way and set the groundwork for the new one we live in today. The “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” the vision of nonviolence it argued for, and the disinherited children of God it sanctified played a critical part in dismantling Jim Crow.

The “Letter” merits revisiting today for its historical import alone, but there are other reasons as well. The moral vision that informs it has never seemed more relevant. At a time when Americans often seem preoccupied with their cultural identity, partisan tribe, or social network node, King’s reminder of the Old Testament prophets who took their message into the world beyond their hometowns calls out to us with its claim on sympathies greater than clan, race, and nation. All of the “Letter’s” subthemes turn on a broader humanistic vision: the duty to cry out for justice for _all_ God’s children, the sin of sitting on the sidelines in the face of suffering, the idea that law should protect the precious worth of every human being.

The “Letter” is compelling as well on literary grounds. Its swerves and swings are remarkable. One moment it offers reflective argument; the next it crackles with prophetic anger. The poise and politesse of the author dissolve into hints of sarcastic disdain, passive aggression, even self-pity. King drops the names of revered philosophers but leavens his erudition with a voyage into the inner recesses of black vulnerability (“When your first name becomes ‘nigger,’ your middle name ‘boy’”) and a tour of white America (“I have looked at the South’s beautiful churches … [and] found myself asking … Who is their God?”). There is also the staccato embrace of extremism, with a sequence of questions and answers that startle like a slap in the face (“Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel? ‘I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.’”).

These varied approaches hint at a third, and perhaps the most compelling, reason to revisit the “Letter”: It reveals much about its often elusive author. It is a supremely personal work from someone moved, and sometimes riven, by rival impulses: rebuke and forgiveness, love of his race and love of humanity. An expressive man, Martin Luther King often hid his passion behind a mask of dignity.

As we move through the “Letter,” we witness a striking transformation. In the first half, we are mainly in the presence of a patient and gracious man, who crafts little moments of brotherhood and tries to win over his critics through appeals to their reason, sympathy, and conscience. But around the midpoint, there’s a distinct shift, really a second act. King drops the mask. He begins to speak more bluntly. Instead of explaining himself, he chides and criticizes. He shows himself to be not just a black man but an angry black man. The diplomat gives way to the prophet.

What the prophet reveals upends our popular notions not just of King but of what he believed. He did not think that many whites had much empathy. He grasped the flawed nature of democracy in America. His indignation reached beyond vitriolic racists and the eight clergymen who criticized the Birmingham insurgency. He took aim at the core of American culture, the vast universe of people who imagined themselves to be decent but never dwelled on the shame of American racism. He was not naive about the power of soaring moral rhetoric to change hearts. King did not rest his optimism on faith in the American dream or the ordained nature of freedom in America. Instead, he found solace in his deep love of black people and the exceptional spirit of the slave ancestors. In all these ways, the “Letter” anticipates the King of the later years who thundered against poverty, racism, and war before he was assassinated in 1968.

Ultimately, the “Letter” challenges us and what we believe about our own nation and its mythology of perfection and the halting, often grudging way we went about redressing that primal flaw of slavery and all the forms of racism that succeeded it.

In my own efforts to make sense of the “Letter,” I have relied heavily on recordings of King’s own voice, particularly his addresses at mass meetings at Birmingham’s black churches right before and after he went to jail. In these settings, he often revealed less varnished versions of his beliefs and feelings. The source material includes a trove of CDs made available only relatively recently at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. One of them contains a barely known postjail speech in which King preached an extraordinary, essentially “black” version of the “Letter,” which qualified and retracted aspects of what he had said to the white clergy.[^2]

In truth, the “Letter” was less formal rhetoric or a philosophical treatise than a transcribed form of oral culture. King’s brilliance was always as a master of the spoken word; that is why listening to him is so important. Moreover, the “Letter” was a mélange of riffs, samples, stories, gambits, and allusions, many of which came from his addresses to black people. Without a deep knowledge of those addresses, it is easy to miss the import of a fleeting allusion to the slave ancestors here or a small clue there that indicates King is preaching under the guise of writing. Andrew Young, the former ambassador to the United Nations, King’s close colleague in SCLC, and a key figure in the Birmingham uprising, observes, “The only way Martin could have answered [the clergymen] was in writing. But if he had been given a chance to go preach [the “Letter”] to them, he probably would have done that.” King, he says, was “like Jeremiah, with fire pent up in his bones, and that’s the way this letter was. It just spewed forth.”[^3]

To understand the “Letter,” it is necessary to place it in its immediate historical context. Part One sets the scene. My aim here is not to document every aspect of the Birmingham movement, a job that has been ably accomplished by others.[^4] It is to chart the events that landed King behind bars and provoked his rising outrage and disappointment and to introduce the distinctive brand of prophetic Christianity that animated him and his colleagues.

The two chapters of Part Two focus on the “Letter” itself. Chapter two]], “Diplomat,” explores King’s careful and reasonable efforts in the first half of the “Letter” to convince whites of the legitimacy of direct action and black impatience. Chapter three]], “Prophet,” explores the critical shift that emerges in the second half of the “Letter” and the dramatic revelations that ensue when King drops the stance of dispassionate reason. As we shall discover, King was “telling the man” in ways that shared much with Malcolm X’s excoriations of whites.

Part Three turns to “The Aftermath.” Chapter four]], “Street Fighter,” tracks King as he leaves the jail and rejoins the insurgency as it applied the arguments of the “Letter” and eventually won the day; traces the impact of Birmingham on the Kennedy administration and on King’s delivery of “I Have a Dream” at the March on Washington; and examines that bitter finale, the bombing of Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. “What killed these girls?” an angry King will ask. In keeping with the heavy load of personal responsibility to act that is central to his gospel of freedom, he refuses to exempt either silent whites or disengaged blacks from culpability.

The epilogue explores the biography of the “Letter” as it moved out into the world. I consider the response to the “Letter” by the journals of opinion that championed it, by some of the white clergymen whose criticism evoked it, and by King’s colleagues whose entire lives in the movement embodied it. I close with a look at the ultimate testimony to the “Letter’s” universality: the students and teachers who continue to be drawn to its literary power and moral indignation; and the protest movements across the globe that still are stirred by its cry for justice.

As we look back at those volatile months in 1963 and consider the arc of history that leads from Birmingham to the election of the first black president and beyond, it is hard not to wonder what King would make of all the elegies to “postracial” America. It will become clear when we examine the “Letter” and “I Have a Dream” in the light of the “Letter” that King had a more ambivalent relation to the national story than is suggested by his occasional invocation of the American dream or the picture of him presented in textbooks or on the national holiday in his name. On the night before his assassination, he reassured his listeners: “We as a people will get there.” He really meant “people” as the black nation within a nation. He read American history as an outsider looking in, even as he claimed a right to belong and selectively used America’s civil religious imagery when it suited him. He also read our history as a realist who harbored no illusions about the repressive powers and the depth of racism he was up against. Nothing in the “Letter,” nothing in the bedlam of Birmingham or its bittersweet aftermath, suggest that King viewed America as a providential nation whose destiny was freedom. Rather, that exceptional nation first had to be created by the exceptionally brave and spiritual people of the civil rights movement.

That the “Letter from Birmingham Jail” was ultimately a black man’s cry for black freedom does not mean King ever lost his empathy for all God’s children. The gospel of freedom is a demanding one. At the March on Washington, King imagined a white interrogator asking, “When will you be satisfied?” King’s answer applied universally: “not until justice rolls down like waters.”[PART ONE](contents.html#part01)

### Prisoner]]

[This is Blasphemy](contents.html#ch01lev1sec1)

The “Letter from Birmingham Jail” wasn’t born in the isolation of a jail cell. All the key subplots of the “Letter” were hatched—most of the themes and even phrases had been anticipated and delivered[^1]—in the eighteen months preceding Martin Luther King’s jailing: the rising defiance of black Americans; the battle between the “fierce immediacy of now” and the resistance of dilatory whites and reluctant Negroes; the clash between an engaged church and one cowering behind stained glass windows; the tension between disappointment and the faith that “the Lord will make a way out of no way”; the duty to respond to suffering humanity’s cry for help and the willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice that it often required in the Deep South. As King told an aroused mass meeting in Albany, Georgia, “They can put you in jail and transform you to glory; if they try to kill you, develop a willingness to die.”[^2]

The Albany Movement had launched a full-fledged assault on segregation in that sleepy farm town in the fall of 1961. King came to Albany in response to a plea from the local movement’s leader, Dr. William Anderson, his former Morehouse College classmate, which basically boiled down to this: _Somebody needs you, Lord, Come by here_. As King pulled up in front of Albany’s Shiloh Baptist Church (and Zion Baptist Church right across the street) on December 15, 1961, the signature sounds of the Albany Movement rang out through the night. Fifteen hundred people had been waiting for the grand leader, some for hours, their spirits lifted by fervent prayer and the rapturous power of freedom songs like “I’m so glad / We’re fighting to be free / Singing glory hallelujah! / I’m so glad.”[^3]

King made his way up to the pulpit through faces transfixed, and a great shout went out: “one sustained cry of joy and welcome as, everyone on his feet, the people waved their arms to him, and he waved back.” Then they turned back to song, improvising verses of “Amen,” but replacing it with “Free-Dom”: “Martin King says freedom / Martin King says freedom / Martin King says freedom,” and then the chorus, “Free-dom! Free-dom!,” until the song switched, seamlessly, into “I woke up this morning / With my mind / SET on freedom.”[^4]

King’s Albany venture came at a charged time for the grand leader and the civil rights movement at large. Six years had passed since the bus boycott he led in Montgomery, Alabama, had anointed him “the” black leader and catapulted him onto the cover of _Time_ magazine. What did he have to show for it? He was still searching to define a mission for himself and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the organization he had helped create in 1957 to inaugurate campaigns of nonviolent direct action. Despite some success in voter registration and citizenship education, there had been few such campaigns, and doubts about King were growing.

They came from different quarters in the black community. Emory O. Jackson, the editor of Birmingham’s black newspaper, wondered: “Is this merely visionary oratory unmatched by action? At the moment there is little more than the press releases from Dr. King’s publicists.” A younger activist thought that King “has been losing since he left Montgomery … And I think eventually that more Negroes and more white Americans will become disillusioned with him, and find that he after all is only another preacher who can talk well.”[^5]

The audacity had passed to a new generation that chafed at the elders’ caution. The sit-in movement begun by black college students in 1960 proudly violated local segregation ordinances at lunch counters across the South, a far more daring exercise of civil disobedience than the bus boycott. Fearless Freedom Riders first sparked by the Congress of Racial Equality were challenging segregation in interstate travel, risking arrest and injury on buses and the terminals where racist thugs awaited them. Rejecting the often imperial style of leadership favored by the preachers, the brave insurgents in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) were building grassroots movements across the Black Belt where they tried to vanquish centuries of fear and resignation and gladly embraced the identity of militants. It was three of those extraordinary SNCC workers—Cordell Reagon, Charles Jones, and Charles Sherrod—who had jump-started the Albany Movement in the first place.[^6]

This push created pushback from the white racists in the region. It also created tensions between King and the younger activists, as the future congressman John Lewis recounted. When Diane Nash, one of the stalwarts of nonviolent protest in Nashville, kept pressing King to join the Freedom Rides in 1961, he replied with visible irritation, “I should choose the time and place of my own Golgotha,” invoking the hill on which Christ was crucified. That encounter with Nash was the first time Lewis heard King mocked as “De Lawd.”[^7] Before the Albany campaign was played out, King became the target of criticism not just from whites who decried him as an “outside agitator” but from some local blacks who saw him as an interloper, the big man who dashed in, hogged the headlines, and bolted, leaving the locals to suffer the consequences.

But up in the pulpit at Shiloh, King still stirred the church with his gospel of freedom. He put their quest in the context of the African struggle for independence of recent years, and he insisted, “There must be repentance for the vitriolic, loud words of people of ill will, but also for the silence of good people.” He warned them about the myth of time—that simply waiting around will somehow bring freedom—and consecrated their “determination to be free.”[^8]

On all his subsequent visits to Albany, King never failed to affirm black people’s responsibility for their own freedom. Popular _resources/books//Gospel of Freedom_ Martin Luther King, Jr. - Jonathan Rieder of black and white children holding hands have long obscured the primacy of black autonomy in King’s exhorting. Downplaying the role of the federal government or the governor of Georgia, he told the audience: “The salvation of the Negro in Albany, Georgia, is within the hands and the soul of the Negro himself.”[^9]

This was the gist of the story King told of Gandhi’s salt march, which he turned into a parable of black triumph against overwhelming odds, really a secular David and Goliath. “Just a few men started out, but when they got down to that sea more than a million people had joined in that march … _and_ Gandhi and those people reached down in the sea and got a little salt in their hands and broke the law, and the minute that happened it seemed I could hear those boys at Number Ten Downing Street in London, England, say: ‘It’s all over now.’” As pandemonium broke out in the church, King continued, “[A]nd if we will mobilize this soul force right here in Albany, Georgia, we will be able to transform this community … And we’ll be eatin’ where we couldn’t eat before. We will be marchin’ where we couldn’t march before … And so let’s get our marchin’ shoes ready … For we are goin’ to Albany’s March to the Sea.”[^10]

As he reached for the fervent finale on his first night in Albany, King echoed the prophet Habukkuk (“O Lord, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear!”): “How long will we have to suffer injustices?” and an older man shouted back, “God Almighty …” Then King asked, “How long will justice be crucified and truth buried?” and again, the man answered, “God Almighty.” King was steeling them for what lay ahead—“Before the victory is won some must face physical death to free their children … But we shall overcome.” And the crowd ratified, “Shall overcome.” Pat Watters, a white Southern reporter whose life was transformed by his experience in the mass meetings, described the scene from his perch in Shiloh. King’s “voice, full of emotion that flowed into the crowd which poured it back to him, almost broke, shouting: ‘Don’t stop now. Keep moving. Walk together, children. Don’t you get weary. There’s a great camp meeting coming.’”[^11]

This flowing and pouring was central to King’s oratory in the mass meetings. As Watters grasped, “The eloquence for which Dr. King was celebrated—his great addresses as at the Washington March in 1963, his writings, like the ‘Letter from the Birmingham Jail’—was more or less studied, polished. The eloquence he found in the little churches of the movement was something else—a weaving of appropriate themes from past speeches, sudden bursts of innovative, emotional talk out of the immediacy of events and the meeting, wondrous structuring of metaphor.”[^12]

King meant to give that speech at Shiloh and steal away. Instead, the passion of the Albany Movement swept him up and pulled him in. The next afternoon at the mass meeting, he rejected the charge “that some of us are agitators. I am here because there are twenty million Negroes in the United States and I love every one of them.” He equally threw back the charge that he was “an outsider”: “Anybody who lives in the United States is not an outsider in the United States. Injustice anywhere is a threat everywhere.” King then led a procession of 250 freedom fighters down through the streets of Albany where they planned to pray for the imprisoned Freedom Riders and the Albany State students who had joined them in the white waiting room of the Trailways bus station. They snaked through the black section of town and entered the downtown where the sheriff, Laurie Pritchett, promptly arrested King. His brief stay in jail was just a prelude to two more trips to the Albany jail during the summer of 1962.[^13]

The Albany Movement was a singing movement. Bernice Johnson, who later founded the gospel group Sweet Honey in the Rock, was one of its teen stars. One of the favorite songs went: “Paul and Silas bound in jail, had no money to go their bail, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.” And then: “Paul and Silas began to shout / jail door opened and they walked out.” This was the conjuring of black Christianity, exploding the line between this world and the next, Old Testament and New, refashioning the apostle Paul, and the prisoner Paul too, into something more like the delivered, an Exodus figure, Daniel in some lion’s den.

King was arrested a second time in Albany, in July 1962, but his release was not as miraculous as Paul’s. King was told that a mysterious stranger had bailed him out, much to his chagrin. In fact, it was Laurie Pritchett’s doing, along with the mayor’s. Sheriff Pritchett later recollected, “We knew we’d continue to have problems [if King stayed in jail], so I talked to some people. I said, ‘We’ve got to get him out, and once we do, I think he’ll leave here.’ It sort of surprised Dr. King. This was the only time when it seemed he didn’t know which way to go. King thought he was being transferred to another jail, but I said, ‘No, you’re leaving.’ He said, ‘I can’t go, Chief Pritchett. I’ll lose face if I go.’ I said, ‘Well you got to go, Dr. King.’ Later on, we discussed this and he told me, ‘This is the one time, not only did you outviolent me, but you outsmarted me.’”[^14]

At the end of July, when King landed back in jail for a third visit, he finally got the chance to serve at least a few weeks. On his last prison stay, the _New York Times Magazine_ had broached with him the idea of a “Letter from Albany Jail,” but his advisers nixed the idea. This time he did issue “A Message from Jail” to the readers of his regular column in the _Amsterdam News_, the black New York City newspaper. Instead of his intended tribute to Jackie Robinson, King gave the gist of one of his most important arguments in favor of civil disobedience. Critics who charged that civil disobedience “fosters disrespect for the law and encourages lawlessness” missed a key distinction, he wrote; the racists who broke the law practiced _uncivil_ disobedience, flouting it with mean spirit and refusing to pay any penalty. By contrast, King’s decision “to break that law and willingly pay the penalty evidences the highest respect for the law.”[^15]

That analysis led to a blowup with Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the younger brother of President John Kennedy. In between the July jail episodes, Robert Elliot, a federal judge appointed by the president, issued a temporary restraining order against King and the leaders of the Albany Movement barring mass demonstrations. The judge opined that such protests would deprive the whites of Albany of _their_ rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.[^16]

Before King arrived at his reluctant decision to obey the injunction, the incensed attorney general called him from Washington. “How could King even think of violating this court order, he demanded to know, when governors and school officials across the South were praying for an excuse not to obey federal school desegregation orders?” King, in turn, wondered, How was democracy even possible when a spate of court decisions stymied the movement at every turn? When the law was routinely hijacked by segregationists to squelch human rights? When blacks were denied basic rights of speech and assembly? “Always, King protested [to Kennedy], somebody would find a way to make protest unreasonable and segregation reasonable for the moment. ‘We’re tired, very tired … I’m tired, we’re sick of it.’”[^17]

Then he really let Kennedy have it. “Some of these problems you have created yourself by appointing these segregationist federal judges.” Kennedy quickly gave the phone to Burke Marshall, his assistant attorney for civil rights, which ended what had become a “shouting match.”[^18]

Andrew Young had never seen King more furious than in these exchanges with Kennedy and Marshall; King was deeply upset, and the arguments were “bitter.” With its intimate admission of “I’m tired,” the fracas reflected King’s rising anger at moderates. The expression of that seething helps us appreciate the restraint King labored under in dealing with the Kennedys and the pain that was its constant accompaniment. More typically, King kept the disappointment to himself and his colleagues, but he often felt it. At one point during the Kennedy administration’s maneuvering in its showdown with Governor Ross Barnett over James Meredith’s desegregation of the University of Mississippi in 1962, King said “[it] made Negroes feel like pawns in a white man’s political game.” At other times, the ire took a passive aggressive twist. Irked by Kennedy’s reluctance to declare a second Emancipation Proclamation, King simply made an excuse for not showing up at a White House function.[^19]

Despite his popular image as an idealistic liberal, John Kennedy was a cool pragmatist. Without embarrassment, he told King he had more urgent things to accomplish than sponsoring an expansive civil rights bill with little chance of getting through the legislative gauntlet of reactionary Republicans and Southern Democrats. His Justice Department kept invoking federalism as a rationale for inaction. When Kennedy wanted to put the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) attorney Thurgood Marshall on the U.S. Court of Appeals, he was stymied by Mississippi Senator James Eastland, the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But the senator wanted Kennedy to appoint to the federal bench the segregationist Harold Cox, who had been known to refer to blacks in his court as “baboons.” Eastland told Robert Kennedy, “Tell your brother that if he will give me Cox I will give him the nigger.” The deal was struck.[^20]

As for Robert Kennedy, the attorney general often saw King as an unrealistic irritant who destabilized the administration’s interests in avoiding racial confrontation. In perfect harmony with Albany’s segregationist establishment, the attorney general encouraged efforts to free King in July 1962 because his jailing was, in Taylor Branch’s summary, “an embarrassment to everybody—to Albany, to the Kennedys, to Georgia, and to the entire United States in the court of world opinion. Therefore, it must be terminated by any means possible.”[^21]

The frustration spilling out of King, then, wasn’t just with the segregationist judges Kennedy appointed to mollify Southern Democrats. The judges simply confirmed King’s own verdict: “Moderation” meant the triumph of cunning and compromise over justice. Here was the central lie of American exceptionalism. America was willing to flirt with that righteous language in inaugural speeches, as Kennedy did when he proclaimed that “We shall pay any price” and “bear any burden … to assure the survival and the success of liberty.”[^22] But that didn’t apply to blacks. One hundred years after the Emancipation Proclamation, eight years after _Brown v. Board of Education_, six years after the Montgomery bus boycott, America remained a tainted democracy, a democracy for white people.

During his third stint in the Albany jail, after he and his close friend, Rev. Ralph Abernathy, finished scrubbing the filthy floor and toilet, King worked on his forthcoming book, _Strength to Love_.[^23] That collection of sermons, aimed at the audience of white liberal Protestants, included another letter, “Paul’s Letter to American Christians.” The Paul of that epistle was not the prisoner or the delivered (of the freedom song), or the Samaritan who comes to the aid of the Macedonians, but the prophet conjured by King, another outside agitator who admonishes Americans as he spreads the gospel of freedom.

The sermon begins with King’s announcing that he has just received a letter from the apostle, postmarked Ephesus. The contrivance allowed King to speak as Paul and thus to skim off some of his authority. Paul is a sharp observer of America’s strange customs. “There is another thing that disturbs me to no end about the American church. You have a white church and you have a Negro church. You have allowed segregation to creep into the doors of the church. How can such a division exist in the true body of Christ?” That wasn’t the only thing that Paul deemed “appalling.” “I understand that there are Christians among you who try to justify segregation on the basis of the Bible. They argue that the Negro is inferior by nature because of Noah’s curse upon the children of Ham. Oh my friends, this is blasphemy … I must say to you … that in Christ ‘there is neither Jew nor Gentile, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for we are all one in Christ Jesus’ … So, Americans, I must urge you to get rid of every aspect of segregation.”[^24]

The two men didn’t only share the same gospel of freedom. Paul also sounded a lot like King. “Yes, America, there is still the need for an Amos to cry out to the nation: ‘Let judgment roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.’” If you just read the passage where Paul says, “Oh my friends, this is blasphemy,” it’s easy to breeze right past that “oh” as if it were trifling. But you have to imagine it as King so often spoke it, drawn out and tremulous, a quavering sigh, more like “Ohhh!,” that signified the spirit was upon him.[^25]

There’s a warning here that we need to take with us once we enter the “Letter from Birmingham Jail” itself: The prophet doesn’t always appear as a prophet; he may come in disguise, veiled in refinement and a handsome suit, his zeal obscured by the pose of dignity. Sometimes, instead of crying out, he delegates that task to others (“there is still a need for an Amos to cry out”). He can even be an elusive prophet, sometimes less zealous than anguished, diffident and mannerly. In short, a flawed and fully human being who sometimes didn’t seem much like a prophet at all.

[Not Enough Negroes are Ready to Die in Birmingham](contents.html#ch01lev1sec2)

The mighty stream of justice never really got rolling through the streets of Albany during King’s time there. The protagonists would debate the various reasons for it: Laurie Pritchitt’s savvy or black factionalism, strategic overreach or a federal injunction. Blacks did make some gains, ranging from increases in voter registration to the enhanced pride that came from defiance. Looking back in 1964, King observed, “Negroes have straightened their backs in Albany. And once a man straightens his back you can’t ride him anymore.” Still, the running down of a once-proud movement, and the mass firings of black cooks and maids, left many in a state of great demoralization.[^26]

There were plenty of other towns in need. For some years, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth had been issuing his own cry for help in Birmingham. In early 1963, King decided to heed it. This time there would be no spontaneous dash to give succor as in Albany. In theory, this would be the first test of a massive campaign of desegregation that King hadn’t stumbled into. It would be implemented with finesse and foresight, informed by the lessons of failure, prophecy with a practical touch.

At first glance, it is hard to imagine two more different characters than King and Shuttlesworth. King could get both fiery mad and fiery glad while preaching, but the fire locked up inside the Birmingham preacher was not modulated a whit by King’s refinement, by his pedigree in the black bourgeoisie, or by his degree from Morehouse College, a distinguished institution of the black elite. Where King was often mannerly and cautious, Shuttlesworth was typically irascible and abrasive. What united them was a commitment to the deliverance of their people. As Shuttlesworth saw it, he and his rebellious allies had risen up “as one man, and with one voice to shout their defiance and declared active warfare until this multi-headed cancer to American democracy be removed from our society.” The racist South “only discarded the ropes of yesterday for the explosives of today; and where the cross-symbol of Christ’s sufferings is considered a thing to be burned rather than something to be borne … This is a religious crusade, a fight between light and darkness, right and wrong, good and evil, fair play vs. tyranny.”[^27]

The righteous warrior brought something else to the battle: unadulterated courage. Maybe the black patricians didn’t warm to him, but his working-class congregants were devoted to a man who had suffered so much for his race. Klansmen had beaten his head with pipes. They blew up his house. Fire shot out from his bed, the mattress flew through the air, but he could only hear the silent words of scripture, “Underneath [you] are the everlasting arms,” and knew immediately that “the only reason God saved me was to lead the fight.” He complained on another occasion, “Not enough Negroes are ready to die in Birmingham.” “Glorious” was his word for the bloody slaughter that felled the Freedom Riders in Birmingham. “Here, Negroes and whites are being beaten together, are riding and suffering together, are praying and working together.”[^28]

As Shuttlesworth once shoved his way through a racist, violent mob, the mob parted. A terrified James Farmer, the head of the Congress of Racial Equality, marveled: “I can only guess that this was an example of the crazy nigger syndrome—man, that nigger is crazy; leave him alone.”[^29]

The man with fire locked inside him had one final thing to recommend him: He was the head of SCLC’s largest affiliate, the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR). He had helped found it in 1956 after the state of Alabama banned the NAACP. He and his band of freedom fighters had been battling the indignities of Jim Crow ever since. They tried to integrate the Birmingham buses, to implement the Supreme Court’s _Brown v. Board of Education_ decision declaring separate but equal schools inherently unequal, to eliminate police brutality and just about everything else that demeaned black people. For seven years, they had managed to hold weekly mass meetings galvanized by the freedom singing of Carlton Reece’s Alabama Christian Movement Choir. Rather than the stripped-down a cappella sound of the Albany singing, with its elaborate polyrhythm and free-flowing improvisation, it was a straight-ahead, full-fledged choir. But it compensated for any loss of spontaneity with the accelerating takeoff of songs like “I’m On My Way to Freedom Land” and the relentless thrust of “99½ Won’t Do.”[^30]

If the ACMHR warriors were combat ready and combat tested, Birmingham seemed a good place to do battle. One reason Albany had been such a setback for the movement was that Pritchett, the sheriff who “outviolenced” King, had a better handle on the stagecraft of spectacle. Holding back on the brutality deprived the movement of the iconography and outrage needed to galvanize a nation that showed every inclination to indifference. In the estimation of Wyatt Tee Walker, the executive director of SCLC, “[We] knew that [in Albany] there had been no real dramatization to the nation of what segregation was like …”[^31] There is a debate about how much that insight shaped SCLC’s design of the Birmingham campaign, but whether it learned it through the ordeal by fire or not is less important to our story than the fact that it soon embraced the principle of phantom audiences. To stage a successful spectacle required national outrage and media focus, which required florid sacraments of suffering, which required the collusion of the racist order.

Birmingham would supply the savagery and the sacraments.

That savagery was notable even by the standards of the Deep South. Birmingham was widely viewed as the most segregated city in the United States. Racial terrorism was commonplace. The bombing of ordinary black homeowners was so prolific that it yielded nicknames for a neighborhood (Dynamite Hill) and the city (Bombingham). On a whim, members of one of its many Ku Klux Klan affiliates kidnapped a black pedestrian, Edward Aaron, out for a walk with his girlfriend. After they forced him to crawl and choose between death or castration, they emasculated him and doused his bleeding wound with turpentine. But first one of them told him, “Well, I want you to carry a message to Shuttlesworth. I want you to tell him to stop sending nigger children and white children to school together or we’re gonna do him like we’re fixing to do you.” For daring to defy white supremacy, Rev. Charles Billups, a key Shuttlesworth ally in the ACMHR, was kidnapped and blindfolded, beaten with chains, tied to a tree, and branded on the stomach with the letters _KKK_.[^32]

Even the blurring of musical borders enraged Birmingham’s guardians of racial purity. They were convinced that rock ’n’ roll was “jungle music,” insidiously entering the minds of white teenagers. The mingling of black and white vinyl 45s on a jukebox, no less than race traitors like Elvis Presley, unnerved them. The smooth pop sound of Nat King Cole provided no immunity from their wrath, even when the white audience that came to hear him in Birmingham in 1956 was segregated. Klansmen rushed the stage and attacked him.[^33]

These were the most lurid expressions of a system that routinely deprived blacks of respect, rights, and opportunity and was woven into the fabric of everyday life. The local segregation code commanded separation in exquisite detail. The section “Negro and White Persons Not To Play Together” not only made it illegal for blacks and whites to play “any game of cards or dice, dominoes or checkers,” it also forbade “any person who, being the owner, proprietor or keeper or superintendent of any tavern, inn, restaurant or other public house or public place, or the clerk, service or employee of such owner, proper” from permitting such a heinous act. No matter how much it owed to the Northern interests of which it was a part, the civic and business elite had made its peace with segregation, some enthusiastically. Maybe the executives at the biggest industry, Tennessee Coal and Iron (a subsidiary of U.S. Steel), and others of their ilk looked askance at the redneck primitives. But they had countenanced the reign of racial brutality for decades and profited from it. Earlier in the century they had used the Klan to break strikes and crush union efforts by exploiting stark divisions of black and white workers.[^34]

Birmingham, then, was truly an American Johannesburg, whose apartheid, as Harrison Salisbury famously described it, was “enforced by the whip, the razor, the gun, the bomb, the torch, the club, the knife, the mob, the police, and many branches of the state’s apparatus.” In a region teeming with rough and racist lawmen, Birmingham boasted one of the roughest, Bull Connor, an old-school head-smacking champion of the segregationist order. He cut his teeth as a union-busting Klan member. Incensed by the civil rights planks in the Democratic platform, he bolted from the 1948 Democratic National Convention and rallied to Senator Strom Thurmond’s Dixiecrat candidacy for president. Connor saw himself as a bulwark against integration and didn’t much care about the niceties of democracy. When Reverend Abraham Woods, a Shuttlesworth colleague, advocated from the pulpit for a boycott of Birmingham’s segregated buses on the model of the Montgomery boycott, Connor had him arrested. His police force was full of Klan members and sympathizers. All the while, he kept company with the violent squads that fancied themselves saviors of the white race. After the _Brown v. Board of Education_ decision, his prediction that “blood would run in the streets” seemed more like an exhortation.[^35]

The collusion of state and private terror took a striking turn on May 14, 1961, when a busload of Freedom Riders rolled into the Birmingham bus station. The Riders were traveling across the South, in a sort of moving sit-in, to press the integration of bus transport. Their two buses had already been attacked earlier that day in Anniston, Alabama. One was firebombed, left flaming beside the road as gasping, choking Freedom Riders fled. Klan members had assaulted the riders of the second bus, then climbed aboard to “escort” them to Birmingham, where sixty more Klansmen waited. Connor had pledged them fifteen unencumbered minutes before his police would arrive at the Trailways station. “By God, if you are going to do this thing, do it right,” he reportedly said. The horde implemented his charge with gusto. As the riders staggered from the bus, the attackers struck with pipes, wooden slats, and key rings. Many of the riders were bloodied and clubbed to the ground. A few, grievously injured, were taken to the hospital.[^36]

This history was enticing as well as frightening to King. Birmingham offered a better theater for redemptive suffering than Albany, not just in the Christian sense. It also gave King and SCLC a chance to redeem themselves as a relevant force. The timing of Easter, with its blood-soaked imagery of crucifixion, would make for perfect imagery. If Laurie Pritchett had killed the protesters with kindness, Connor might actually try to kill them.

As SCLC prepared for a March launch of its campaign, a charged battle about timing was erupting across the nation. The movement insisted on “now.” Diehard racists vowed “never.” And all manner of procrastinators—the risk-averse Kennedys, “moderate” segregationists, and reluctant Negroes—equivocated: “wait.”

The cry of “never” was uttered by George Wallace, whose triumph in the 1962 Alabama governor’s race vindicated his early career pledge that he “would never be outniggered again.” It also ratified Alabama’s vanguard status in the Southern wave of radical resistance to civil rights.

On the stump, Wallace mocked “integrating, scallawagging, carpetbagging” judges and “sissy britches in Alabama who say we’ve got to conform … to mixing the races in the schools.” What truly delighted his audiences was his refusal “to abide by any illegal federal court order even to the point of standing at the schoolhouse door.” Some of that frenzy has to be credited to his speechwriter, Asa Earl Carter, a right-winger with a long history of venomous diatribes against “blacks, Jews, Yankees, and all ‘lesser breeds’ who challenged the divinely mandated supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon race.” Carter was a terrorist as well as a wordsmith; he had organized his own Ku Klux Klan posse, whose members stoned Autherine Lucy, the first black to attempt to integrate the University of Alabama. They were also the ones who had attacked Nat King Cole and castrated Edward Aaron.[^37]

Martin Luther King never underplayed the virtuoso skills of the fellow orator he considered maybe “the most dangerous racist in America today.” King judged “Wallaceism bigger than Wallace. I am not sure that he believes all the poison he preaches, but he is artful enough to convince others that he does … He just has four [speeches], but he works on them and hones them so that they are little minor classics.”[^38]

On January 14, 1963, Wallace delivered his inaugural speech at the state capitol in Montgomery. It was a throw down of spectacular resistance. Wallace’s chant “Segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever” would find an echo in King’s cry in Birmingham after he got out of jail: “And we are through with segregation now, henceforth, and forever.” Wallace’s decrial of “outside agitators” anticipated King’s claim: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” Against King’s appeal to the unity of mankind, Wallace denounced integration as “communistic amalgamation.”

The governor insisted on the sacred duty to remember the tragic history of Southern whites and the “heel of oppression” that “vulturous carpetbaggers” from the North had placed on the region’s neck. He spoke from the hallowed ground “where once Jefferson Davis stood, and took an oath to my people … from this Cradle of the Confederacy, this very Heart of the Great Anglo-Saxon Southland, that today we sound the drum for freedom as have our generations of forebears before us done … Let us rise to the call of freedom-loving blood that is in us and send our answer to the tyranny that clanks its chains upon the South.” Wallace’s love of his region did not prevent a modicum of empathy for those beyond it. He grieved for the white minorities in apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia who were persecuted not just by the “international colored majority” but also by the “international racism of the liberals …”

The inaugural speech was a redneck version of the “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” Instead of sitting down at lunch counters, Wallace vowed to stand in the entranceway to keep blacks out of the University of Alabama. He promised to defy the Supreme Court’s ruling that had banished God from the classroom. He exuded contempt for the “infamous, illegal 14th Amendment,” one more instance of the evisceration of the “free heritage as bequeathed to us as sons of free fathers.” His state troopers would infuse this Confederate brand of disobedience with a wallop of mayhem, which King was to experience in the months ahead.[^39]

Wallace’s feral cry provoked an immediate rejoinder from a group of moderate Alabama clergymen who crafted “An Appeal for Law and Order and Common Sense.” The eleven signatories represented the most prestigious Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish clergymen in the state of Alabama. The group included each of the eight clergymen whose April 12 condemnation of King and the protests in Birmingham provoked the “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” Whatever else those adversaries of King may have been, they represented the more enlightened reaches of Southern white religion at the time.[^40]

The eleven clergy were mindful both of the violence that greeted James Meredith’s integration of Ole Miss the previous fall and the coming in June of the first effort to integrate the University of Alabama since death threats had driven Autherine Lucy from the Tuscaloosa campus. That was the backdrop for the clergymen’s statement: “A series of court decisions will soon bring about desegregation of certain schools and colleges in Alabama. Many sincere people oppose this change and are deeply troubled by it. As southerners, we understand this. We nevertheless feel that defiance is neither the right answer nor the solution. And we feel that inflammatory and rebellious statements can lead only to violence, discord, confusion and disgrace for our beloved state.”

The clergymen went on to affirm that “hatred and violence have no sanction in our religious and political traditions.” That was a flagrant untruth—violence and hatred were utterly Southern traditions when it came to black people—but it offered a nice aspirational note. And they did aver that “every human being is created in the image of God and is entitled to respect as a fellow human being with all basic rights, privileges, and responsibilities which belong to humanity.”[^41]

If such sentiments seem like pieties hard to quibble with, it required bravery to voice them in Wallace’s Alabama. They sufficed to elicit death threats. This was a world in which, as one of the most prominent Christian Right leaders lamented in the 1990s, “the white evangelical church marched in the vanguard of the campaign to preserve segregation in the South. George Wallace may have stood in the schoolhouse door, but evangelical clergy provided the moral framework for his actions.” While the mainstream Protestant denominations by and large failed to join the diehard defenders of the old order, the pews did not always align with the pulpits. More than a few Southern clergymen preached “that a colored person is a child of God and has a right to worship in any of God’s houses,” one such minister observed at the time, only to discover that “old friends and strong financial supporters … become cold and aloof.”[^42]

No matter how admirable the clergymen’s critique of demagoguery, what they avoided saying was as revealing as what they said. Affirming the rights that belonged to humanity, they did not say that _Negroes_ were entitled to equal political rights. Nor did they work up the spiritual fervor to declare segregation an affront to God’s love for all his children. They did not utter the command that King put in the mouth of the apostle in “Paul’s Letter to American Christians”: “So, Americans, I must urge you to get rid of every aspect of segregation.” In short, whatever strategic motives governed its tactful vagueness, the statement was emblematic of the morally compromised stance of legions of moderate ministers throughout the region.

Such right-thinking clergymen disdained Wallace as a brute. They would have recoiled from the Evangelical Christian Council’s denunciation of integration as “satanic, unconstitutional, and one of the main objectives of the Communist Party.” But most were too comfortable with the way things were to risk alienating their congregations. Instead, they retreated into silence on the race question. As the Southern journalist Ralph McGill captured the moral abdication of such ministers, “The ideology of moderation was mostly myth … The self-styled moderate turned out to be one who stood on the sidelines wringing his hands and urging both parties in conflict to be calm.”[^43]

Activist black ministers reacted to the moral evasions of white religion, and Southern Christianity in particular, with disdain and indignation. Rev. C. Herbert Oliver recalls, “All these preachers were preaching Jesus and God’s love. Yet they were satisfied with people being thrown in jail and you can’t get a cup of coffee at a lunch counter! … The Christianity that existed in Alabama was not the Christianity of the Bible.” It still galls Rev. C. T. Vivian, a legend of the nonviolent movement, that Southern whites claimed to believe “in every ‘jot and tittle’ of [the Bible]” and had the nerve “to talk about a Christ of love” yet they “still hated millions of people for no reason other than the color of their skin.” The preachers “knew [their congregants] weren’t Christian” but they refused to condemn segregation or support a civil rights movement that was trying to create a world that reflected the love ethic of Jesus. “Whose God was God in the South?” asks Vivian. “A God of color!”[^44]

The white clergy’s statement lacked the bite of King and the other participants in the Chicago Conference on Race and Religion who gathered together in mid-January. Sponsored by the National Council of Churches, the Social Action Commission of the Synagogue Council of America, and the Social Action Department of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, the convocation drew seven hundred people from more than sixty denominations. They had ostensibly convened to mark the centennial anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, but their true aim was prophetic rather than commemorative: to mobilize “the joint moral force of the churches and synagogues to bear on the problem of racial segregation.”[^45]

At the close of the meeting, the conference unanimously endorsed “An Appeal to the Conscience of the American People.” The title alone offered a contrast with the muted moral voice of the Southern clergy’s “An Appeal for Law and Order and Common Sense.” So did its mission: “We call upon all the American people to work, to pray and to act courageously in the cause of human equality and dignity while there is still time, to eliminate racism permanently and decisively, to seize the historic opportunity the Lord has given us for healing an ancient rupture in the human family, to do this for the glory of God.”[^46]

This was the scene of King’s first meeting with Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, whom King would dub “my rabbi” and who would lock arms with King in the front line of the Selma to Montgomery March in 1965. Heschel, who could blend kibitzing with prophetic zeal, at times played a higher form of the wiseguy. The first conference on race and religion, he noted in his conference remarks, had already taken place—between Moses and Pharaoh. Still, he said, “It was easier for the children of Israel to cross the Red Sea than for a Negro to cross certain university campuses.”[^47]

If the Southern clergymen minced words, Heschel fired his off with blunt force. Racism was a sin, a stench in God’s nostrils, unmitigated evil. A century after the Emancipation Proclamation, it was time for “the white man … to stop being a slave to wholesale contempt.” Against the Southern clergymen’s cool moral register, Heschel invoked Ecclesiastes: “I saw all the oppressions that are practiced under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no one to comfort them.” In countless ways, he anticipated the “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” berating moderation: “Our standards are modest; our sense of injustice tolerable, timid; our moral indignation impermanent … The conscience … is subject to fatigue, longs for comfort. Yet those who are hurt, and He who inhabits eternity, neither slumber nor sleep.” Always, he emphasized the imperative to act that defined true piety: “We have failed to demand, to insist, to challenge, to chastise.”

Likely because he was among the high-minded and the like-minded, King’s prepared speech and the published version lacked the controlled wrath of the “Letter.” Yet even in Chicago he did not fail to challenge and chastise. He decried the shame of American racism. He rejected cries to wait: “The oft-repeated clichés, ‘the time is not ripe,’ ‘Negroes are not culturally ready,’ are a stench in the nostrils of God.” And he called upon “Church and Synagogue … [to recognize] … the need for prophecy. May the problem of race in America soon make hearts burn so that prophets will rise up saying, ‘Thus saith the Lord,’ and cry out as Amos did, ‘Let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an everflowing stream.’”[^48]

With this little preface, King slipped into his preacher cadence and mass meeting refrain right on the written page. “The time is always right to do what is right. _Now_ is the time to realize the American dream. _Now_ is the time to transform the bleak and desolate midnight of man’s inhumanity to man into a glowing daybreak of justice and freedom.” Such urgency accounted for King’s rebuke of the moral evasions of “religious bodies in America” that “mouth pious irrelevances [_sic_] and sanctimonious trivialities.” All this and more would stream into the “Letter.”

“Called to combat social evils,” King observed in Chicago, the church “has often remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained glass windows.” The Birmingham campaign was King’s and Shuttlesworth’s flying leap out those stained glass windows into the streets below.

[Traitors to their Race](contents.html#ch01lev1sec3)

There was one problem with leaping out the window. Birmingham wasn’t Paul’s Tarsus or Amos’s Samaria. The debacle of Albany had made it clear that applied prophecy demanded finesse, media savvy, and prep work. Without executive function, the gospel of freedom could not be executed.

It would be forever a point of pride for SCLC that Birmingham was its first meticulously planned campaign, a narrative sustained by the image of Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker as the the field marshall who laid out every detail of Project C (for confrontation), with its precisely escalating stages from boycott through political marches on to mass jailings. While Walker’s contributions were extraordinary, two complications that bore on King’s arrest and the “Letter” itself would soon become clear. The design of the campaign had not been quite planful enough. And the strategy of confrontation, mass jailing, and brutal spectacle was improvisation born out of the failures of SCLC’s initial strategy.[^49]

The campaign SCLC was about to launch piggybacked on the boycott that the Korean War veteran Frank Dukes and other students at Birmingham’s black Miles College, inspired by the sit-in movement and supported by the ACMHR, began in January 1962. “Wear your old clothes for freedom” demanded their slogan. “Why spend hundreds of dollars at a store where you cannot spend twenty-five cents for a hamburger,” asked the handbills. “Why spend first-class money and be treated as a third-class citizen?” Although the boycott eventually lost traction over the summer of 1962, the effort vindicated the movement’s canny tally of the merchants’ fragile margin of profit and their vulnerability to a withdrawal of black shoppers.[^50]

The boycott exposed fault lines within the white and black community that proved critical in the insurgency ahead. A few white businessmen had begun to flirt with the idea of reaching out to blacks. They didn’t mean activists like Shuttlesworth, whom they saw as a distasteful firebrand, or the activist students who created “unpleasant situations,” but moderates like black millionaire A. G. Gaston and other black mandarins who favored biracial discussions. The students chafed at such fanciful faith in “communication.” As Dukes put it, “Go slow—go slow—go slow. That’s what you all advise us to do. [But] God helps those who help themselves. You pray to God but when you get off your knees, you got to go out and work if you want to eat.”[^51]

Racial tensions, then, had already been rising when the SCLC scheduled its September 1962 board meeting in Birmingham. Just the rumor that King intended to call for demonstrations prompted the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce to form the Senior Citizens Committee, a secret organization of white elites from the industrial, merchant, and finance sectors. Its Subcommittee on Race unwittingly revealed the true meaning of “moderation.”[^52]

Subcommittee head Sidney Smyer, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and a wealthy businessman with extensive real estate holdings, had not undergone a moral awakening. He had a sterling résumé as a segregationist. He had joined the Dixiecrat revolt against the Democratic Party’s 1948 civil rights plank. He fought the integration of Southern Methodist churches. After the _Brown v. Board of Education_ ruling, he became an acolyte of the White Citizens Council, the upscale, generally peaceful alternative to the Ku Klux Klan. The Alabama Council aimed “to make it difficult, if not impossible, for a Negro who advocates desegregation to find and hold a job, get credit, or renew a mortgage.” Its less “uptown” chapters occasionally embraced gamier solutions. “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all whites are created with certain rights, among them are life, liberty, and the pursuit of dead niggers.”[^53]

Yet Smyer was also a realist who could foresee the coming of the end of racial separation. And he could compute the cost that the Dukes boycott had inflicted on the downtown economy. To such “dignified segregationists,” as Shuttlesworth aptly named them, Bull Connor was an increasing embarrassment, especially after the Freedom Riders’ bloodbath. A hard-hitting CBS special, _Who Speaks for Birmingham?_, which gave prominence to the slaughter, had not advanced the city’s reputation or business climate. In Smyer’s words, the racial violence had given Birmingham “a black eye.”

Smyer quickly discovered that racial peace required a perilous act of race mixing, sitting down with Fred Shuttlesworth. A meeting was arranged. When Shuttlesworth entered the room, the white businessmen stood up and said, “Dr. Shuttlesworth, we’re glad to see you.” Shuttlesworth rejoined, “Well, I don’t wanna be a ‘doctor.’ Just too bad we haven’t shaken all these years I been here now sufferin’ for five or six or seven years.”[^54]

Smyer got right down to business. “Well, we wanna—we just wanna know how we can help [keep] Dr. King … outa here.” Shuttlesworth didn’t need Smyer’s help to explode the pretense of idle palaver. He blasted the whites for never speaking up after all the occasions he had been bombed. “So I’m not of a mind that this morning I came to be used by you, and I’m certain I’m not your darling, and I don’t propose to be. I’m nobody’s darling, and if you’ve got some reason for calling me, what can you offer? … That’s what I’m here for, not to hold a conversation, because I don’t think we’re that brotherly.”

Smyer’s reply that he couldn’t speak for the merchants elicited a farewell from Shuttlesworth. “Well, I’m talkin’ to the wrong crowd then. Let’s go, gentlemen … you wastin’ my time. I’m busy … I’m fightin’ segregation … How much of this can you offer?”

At a follow-up meeting, Isadore Pizitz, the owner of one of the larger department stores, rebuffed Shuttlesworth’s demand to desegregate the bathrooms of his store. As Diane McWhorter remarks, this Jewish enforcer of Jim Crow who humored Bull Connor apparently did not want to “know about one of Bull’s favorite quips: that a Jew was nothing in the world but a ‘nigger turned inside out.’”[^55]

Shuttlesworth warned Pizitz “exactly how it’s going to be”: Shuttlesworth, Martin Luther King, and Ralph Abernathy were going to sit in at his store. “We won’t walk out. We’ll be dragged out by Bull Connor’s efficient police. And while we’re in jail, we won’t shower or eat, and all the world will see how bad we look and how bad this city is.” A representative from Loveman’s chimed in with “Well, I’ll be glad to desegregate the water [fountains]—” but Shuttlesworth interrupted: “We’re past water now. We have to have toilets. Women have to be able to refresh themselves in your stores.” The Sears representative replied, “That door to my toilet, I can just probably have my janitor paint [over the White Only sign].” He darted out of the room, and quickly returned. “He’s paintin’ the door now.” On the basis of this act of good faith, the movement suspended the protests, and the merchants agreed to desegregate their bathrooms.[^56]

These surreal encounters imparted vital lessons: The quickest way to arouse white desire to “communicate” was economic pain and bad publicity; white concern about black affliction often meant enlisting black allies to slow the pace of integration; so-called white moderates could not be trusted to keep their promises. As soon as King and SCLC left town, the modest accord on integration collapsed. Some of the merchants never implemented the agreement. Others were threatened by Bull Connor for violating segregation ordinances. The city’s suddenly zealous building inspectors “discovered” costly code violations: One merchant faced a nine-thousand-dollar bill for elevator repairs, and another incurred expenses of one hundred thousand dollars for work to pass the fire code.[^57]

In early 1963, a few days before George Wallace’s inaugural speech, the clergymen’s statement on law and order, and the Chicago Conference on Race and Religion, King convened a retreat in Georgia to reflect on the status of SCLC and its next move. The dozen or so people who attended the mid-January meeting included Wyatt Tee Walker, Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, Fred Shuttlesworth, and King’s friend and adviser from New York Stanley Levison. The group decided to commit to Birmingham. SCLC crafted a tight plan with clear goals: the desegregation of downtown lunch counters, bathrooms, and water fountains; the upgrading of employment in the stores; and the formation of a biracial committee to discuss grievances. The campaign was designed to reach an Easter climax.[^58]

As the group completed its initial plans, the reality began to sink in. They all knew about Bombingham, the castration of Edward Aaron, the fiendish Bull Connor. So it wasn’t hyperbole that led King to tell his colleagues, “I want to make a point that I think everyone here should consider very carefully and decide if he wants to be with this campaign … There are something like eight people here assessing the type of enemy we’re going to face. I have to tell you that in my judgment, some of the people sitting here today will not come back alive from this campaign. And I want you to think about that.”[^59]

One half century later Wyatt Walker still turns grave as he remembers saying good-bye to his wife and children and thinking that he would never see them again. “I didn’t see how we would get out of Birmingham alive, that’s how bad Birmingham was. It was always in the back of my mind.” King, by contrast, “felt like he wouldn’t live through the struggle [anyway], and he didn’t. He used to say to us that he wouldn’t make it to forty. And we thought he was being melodramatic. But he understood how deep racism was in the nation more than we did.”[^60]

Decades ago Andrew Young emphasized that King was no more keen to go to Birmingham than he had been to leap into the fray of Montgomery. He went there “because Fred Shuttlesworth pleaded with him to do it … [For King] knew, more than anybody else, that every time he made a commitment to something like this [it could mean his death] … He would say, for instance, ‘Now Andy, Bull Connor doesn’t play.’”[^61]

It did not hurt to have a knack for gallows humor while applying the gospel of freedom in these circumstances. As Young recollected, kicking back over ribs late into the night, King would tell his colleagues, “ ‘Now y’all think they gon’ get me. But all y’all be out there jumping in front of the camera,’ and he said, ‘the bullet might be aimed for me but one of y’all going to get it … But don’t worry,’ he said, ‘I will preach the best funeral you ever had.’”[^62]

Young also recalls another King riff, possibly from the retreat or late at night in Birmingham: “Lord, white folks made a big mistake, today. They have sent home to glory your faithful servant, Andrew Young. Lord, have mercy on the white folks who did this terrible deed. They killed the wrong Negro. In Andrew Young, white folk had a friend so faithful, so enduring they should never have harmed a hair on his head. Of all my associates, no one loved white folks as much as Andy.”[^63]

Mocking death was one way to subdue it. Says Young today, “King was teaching us to laugh at the possibility of our own death.”[^64] That intimacy with mortality, the willingness to die, the imagery of sacrifice it suggested, the heroic precedent of their savior on the cross—these would remain part of all the group’s future efforts to deliver black people.

With less than three months until Easter, the pace of preparations intensified. Walker traveled to Birmingham to scout routes, count seats at lunch counters, and check out bail rules. King and Abernathy slipped into the city to firm up plans with ACMHR leaders. In early February, one speaker tantalized a mass meeting: “In March, we hope to show you something that has never been shown before in Birmingham, something you will all be proud of.” Shuttlesworth followed him: “I tell you Jericho’s Walls are weakening.” King made time for his dialogue with white churches and synagogues, dashing off to Manhattan to declare before a sympathetic audience at Temple B’nai Jeshurun, “All men are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.”[^65]

On March 31, eager to secure financial support for both the bail fund and a nearly insolvent SCLC, King and Shuttlesworth crowded into the Upper West Side Manhattan apartment of Harry Belafonte, the folksinger, actor, and King ally. Sworn to secrecy about the impending campaign, the roughly seventy-five people in the room included wealthy liberal donors, celebrity actors (Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Anthony Quinn, Sidney Poitier), journalists (Anthony Lewis and Tom Wicker of the _New York Times_, the editor of the then-liberal _New York Post_ James Wechsler, the _New Republic_ editor Murray Kempton), and dignitaries like Governor Nelson Rockefeller’s press adviser, Hugh Morrow.[^66]

King spoke first, stressing the urgency of Birmingham, the symbolic primacy of the Easter timing, and the movement’s desperate need for bail money. But it was Fred Shuttlesworth who roused the room with his resolve. “If freedom doesn’t come now, it may be too late for it ever to come. We hope that you will join us in the good fight. If you don’t, we are prepared to go it alone.” Then he unnerved them. As King described that moment, “There was a silence almost like the shock of a fresh discovery when Shuttlesworth said, ‘You have to be prepared to die before you can begin to live.’” Some people spotted King twitching, a slight jerking of the head, which he later told Belafonte was “nerves.” Once the sobered audience recovered its composure, it pledged to donate enthusiastically.[^67]

After everyone had left, Belafonte and his wife stayed up into the early hours of morning with King and Abernathy, as the two leaders found relief from the tension in drink and banter. Before long King was teasing Abernathy mercilessly. “Let me be sure to get arrested with people who don’t snore.” Ignoring his buddy’s protestations, King continued: “You are _torture_ … White folks ain’t _invented_ anything that can get to me like you do. _Anything_ they want me to admit to, I will, if they’ll just get you and your snoring out of my cell.”[^68]

Only three days remained until the start of the twice-postponed protests. Initially set for March, that date collided with political exigency. After the reform coalition had eliminated his position of commissioner of public safety, Bull Connor had entered a three-way mayoral race set for March 5. The civic and business elites crystallized around the candidacy of the eventual victor, Albert Boutwell, as the great white hope for a more temperate approach to race. Fears began to mount in both white and black quarters that racial ferment might tip the election to Bull Connor. Although purists of direct action opposed any compromise with the schedule of righteousness, King yielded to the demands of his friends in the black elite who bombarded him with pleas to hold off the protest until after the election. A surprise runoff between Boutwell and Connor led to a second postponement until April.[^69]

Who was this Boutwell who would excite hopes of a “New Day in Birmingham”? Like Smyer, he had been a good Dixiecrat and relentless advocate of segregation. He had worked to crush the biracial populism of Governor Jim Folsom. He championed the Pupil Placement Act, which essentially neutralized the import of _Brown v. Board of Education_. As an “intellectual adviser” to the White Citizens Councils, he had delivered the radio attack on the Civil Rights Act of 1957 as “monstrous legislation.” When he was the lieutenant governor of Georgia, he had organized a regionwide segregationist think tank to “carry this fight to the people nationally.” His mayoral campaign may have modulated carnage and stridency but not his faith in white supremacy. “I am determined that we are going to defend, I hope maintain, segregation,” he said, “but we are not going to be a city of unrestrained and unhampered mockery of the law.”[^70]

On April 2, Boutwell defeated Bull Connor. At last, the battle for Birmingham was joined. With only ten days remaining until Good Friday, the postponement had left the sacrificial symbolism of Easter intact. But diminishing the days in which black shoppers could refrain from buying new Easter outfits also reduced the boycott’s effective leverage. King kicked things off on April 3 with a promise to lead protests until “pharaoh lets God’s people go.” The movement began nightly mass meetings that would continue into May. And for ten days right through Good Friday, freedom singers sang, preachers preached, and jailbirds went to jail. Yet despite the brio of the meetings and the heroism of first responders, the movement faltered. The rocky rollout gave an ironic testimony to King’s faith in “the content of character” over “the color of skin”: The blacks of Birmingham could betray and disappoint him as much as their white neighbors did.

“The patience of an oppressed people cannot endure forever,” proclaimed the Birmingham Manifesto issued on that first day of deliverance. Unfortunately, the hundreds of the oppressed who had signed pledges to go to jail that week shrank to a mere fifty now that the time had come to parade their impatience. Before a handful of demonstrators at Britling Cafeteria were hauled off to jail when they sat at the counter, one Klansman spit in the face of the Reverend Calvin Woods, who smiled back at him. Things were even more anticlimactic at the Kress, Loveman, Pizitz, and Woolworth stores. In some of them, the staff simply turned off the lights and closed the stores. By Saturday the movement’s laserlike focus on the merchants was blurring, as Shuttlesworth led a march to the city jail, where police arrested him and forty others.[^71]

The exultant rhetoric of the nightly mass meetings did not square with the paltry daytime results. On the first night, Shuttlesworth recounted, “Twenty-five people came to see me this morning and said here’s my body. I told them unless you are ready to go to jail and give your body and your soul to our movement then go home. What did they do? They went to jail.” King assured the audience: “We are going to fill the jails in Birmingham. We are going to turn Birmingham upside down and right side up.” But he was already suffering flashbacks of Albany, and a defensive undertone entered his addresses. At this late stage, he still felt a need to justify his presence in the city—to black people. “We in Atlanta have come to the aid of Fred Shuttlesworth. He called on us and we were glad to come because of the injustice in Birmingham … We are here because your problem is ours.” And he was still trying to justify the timing of the protests. “Some people have told us to wait. It is not the time but we have waited too long. Now is the time to get rid of the injustice. The time is always right to do right.”[^72]

As King’s worries mounted, he told Walker, “Wyatt, you’ve got to find some way to make Bull Connor tip his hand.” For a single moment, on Palm Sunday, Walker had an intimation of triumph. During a march to City Hall, Connor had brought out the canine corps. A dog lunged, a bystander waved a knife at it, and newsmen snapped pictures. That evening an exuberant Walker was jumping up and down, exclaiming, “We’ve got a movement. We’ve got a movement. We had some police brutality. They brought out the dogs. We’ve got a movement.” But Connor, who still had a few months left in office, recovered his serenity and muzzled the dogs. There was no dramaturgy of suffering, no outpouring of national outrage and sympathy.[^73]

Instead, a chorus of “Wait” muffled the cry of “Now is the time.” From Washington, Robert Kennedy sent word back to King that he thought the protests ill timed; halt them, he requested. “The Movement’s natural white allies [in Birmingham] had cold shoulders,” according to Diane McWhorter. “The moderates were furious over ‘outside agitators’ spoiling an orderly changing of the political order.” Toward the end of the first week of protests, the _Washington Post_ headline declared, MANY HOLD BIRMINGHAM SIT-INS ILL-TIMED TO ACHIEVE GOALS. The reporting in the story below it verged on editorializing: “To many people it seemed that a few weeks more without direct action … was a short time to wait.”[^74]

Worse still, King discovered that countless blacks were saying the same thing the whites had been saying: that King was an outsider, that he should wait. Clearly, just because the big man from Atlanta said “jump” they were not about to say “how high?”

King had a premonition of black reluctance when he and Abernathy arrived in Birmingham on April 3 and asked Shuttlesworth with foreboding, “Where’s Ware?” referring to Rev. J. L. Ware, the head of Birmingham’s alliance of black Baptist ministers. The two leaders had expected to be greeted by a delegation of the key black religious and political actors they were counting on to supply “the troops” for the protests. Shuttlesworth immediately drove an edgy King to an alliance meeting already in progress. When they walked in, Abernathy recalled in his autobiography, Ware “stopped in the middle of a sentence, and all heads turned around. But there was no burst of applause and no ripple of friendly smiles. Most of the faces were grave and enigmatic.”[^75] King and Abernathy left the meeting brooding in silence.

SCLC had not done any better a job of gauging or building the support of secular black leaders, who chafed at what they took to be King’s presumptuous entrance into their fiefdoms. As late as the second week of the campaign, A. G. Gaston’s statement calling for “all the citizens of Birmingham” to work together to solve their own problems and “due recognition to the local colored leadership among us” was a double jab at King. Black businessmen and professionals argued, “We ought to give Boutwell more of a chance,” and “What we need is more community cooperation and fewer picket lines.” Emory Jackson, the editor of the local black newspaper who advocated fighting racism through legal appeals, mimicked the white local newspapers in maintaining a news blackout of much of the campaign. He opposed King as a “glossy personality.”[^76]

This failure of black leaders to rally around him rankled King. It wasn’t just that he felt blindsided by the criticism; the very fact of the opposition bothered him. As sensitive as King was to white criticism, black disapproval always stung him more. “Even my own people are criticizing me,” he sometimes complained. Once, when King, Andrew Young, and another colleague, Bernard Lee, were stopped at a light in the Cleveland ghetto, a prostitute hollered, “There’s that Uncle Tom, Martin Luther King. What’s _he_ doing here?” A wounded King insisted on going back to convince her otherwise. When Lee said, “Oh, Doc, don’t pay any attention to those women. They’re just ignorant,” King screamed, “TURN THE CAR AROUND, BERNARD.”[^77]

The final obstacle was the most demoralizing: Insufficient numbers of ordinary black people embraced the vocation of suffering. The mere presence of Martin Luther King, Jr., had not magically summoned the vast spiritual legions required for battle. It was one thing to take the story of Exodus out of the Bible’s time and lay it down in Birmingham by singing, “I’m on my way to freedom land” instead of to Canaan. It was quite another to walk out the church door and risk Bull Connor’s wrath. Another verse of the song, “If you don’t go, don’t you hinder me,” hinted at the darker side of the story of Exodus: the longing for the fleshpots of Egypt, the murmuring against Moses in the wilderness, the nagging fear, _What if there were giants in the land of Canaan_?

Preaching in Atlanta back in March, King told his Ebenezer congregation the story of a white man who recommended that blacks wait for freedom to come. He said he believed in integration, “but I know it will not come until God gets ready for it to come. You Negroes should stop protesting and start praying!” But King directed his pique toward the black congregation. “If you end up doing nothing but praying we will be living in segregation two hundred or three hundred years from now … God will never allow prayer to become a substitute for working intelligence.” There was an echo here of Rabbi Heschel’s remarks in Chicago when he observed that if the Israelites had heeded similar counsels, “I would still be in Egypt building pyramids.”[^78]

King rarely invoked Exodus in his sermons, but now he offered: “The children of Israel got mixed up on that problem one day. They got out there and felt that if they were to get to the Promised Land they only get there by God’s power … And they got to calling on him and God told Moses, ‘Go back and tell them something for me’ … Read it over in the book of Exodus: ‘And the Lord said unto Moses wherefore cryeth thy unto me. Speak unto the children of Israel and tell them to go forward.’”[^79]

King was throwing down on two fronts, one black, one white, making the same arguments to blacks about time, responsibility, and waiting that he would bring to a boil in the “Letter”: The idea that time itself would resolve ills was a delusion. In truth, what you did with time—how you used it or abused it, for evil or for good—that was what mattered. Black diffidence was no better than white indifference.

King liked theologian Paul Tillich’s phrase “the courage to be.” This existential strain was key to King’s reworking of the prophetic tradition of deliverance. In his sermon “Moses at the Red Sea,” Rev. C. L. Franklin, King’s favorite preacher and the father of Aretha Franklin, stressed: “But you know God always has his Moseses on hand,” though Franklin allowed that Moses’ name might be George Washington Carver as well as Frederick Douglass. Franklin’s concern was the realm of personal trials no less than bondage, and the message included an appeal to patience: “Oh, wait a little while / … Just wait on him. Just wait on him / He’ll lead you across the Red Seas. / He’ll make you overcome your enemies.”[^80]

But King’s message was that God wanted you to deliver yourself. His gospel of freedom mixed responsibility, spiritual recovery, and racial solidarity in a heady brew. This emphasis on the need for a change in black consciousness aligned him with the most diverse cultural streams: the traditional American notion of being born again; its secular incarnation in the therapeutic ideal of identity as a project of self-fashioning; the version of recovery offered by the black supremacist group the Nation of Islam, that blacks had to free their minds from the crippling legacy of white teachings that they were inferior and primitive. It also jibed with the Exodus story: The Israelites needed forty years in the wilderness to get their minds right, so that they could cease their whining, overcome dependency, and stop hankering for the fleshpots of Egypt.

None of King’s eloquence was sufficient to galvanize a critical mass of Birmingham’s wary black residents. The chance of a devastating failure mounted as the days passed, and a frustrated King began to lash back. Rev. C. Herbert Oliver, who had founded the Inter-Citizens Committee to gather affidavits to document racist violence and police brutality, was quoted in the _New York Times_ saying that the movement had stalled. He was summoned to meet King, Wyatt Tee Walker, and Abernathy at the Gaston Motel. According to Oliver, King certainly didn’t seem all that nonviolent that day! How dare you tell that to the _Times_, King berated Oliver, slamming his hand down on the table in fury. “He was out of control, livid, really angry.” All the while Oliver was thinking to himself, something like “No, how dare you. Birmingham is my town, not yours. No one tells me what to do.”[^81]

King finally accepted this irresistible conclusion: To take the fight to whites, he first had to repair the rift with blacks. He asked Ware to set up a meeting with the black Baptist preachers. King had long decried the whoopers who “spit all over their tune,” the preachers with too much religion in their feet. Now on April 8, the Monday of Holy Week, King answered the black ministers who had been so chilly to him with his standard critique of a “dry as dust” religion that “extoll[ed] the glories of Heaven while ignoring the social conditions that cause men an earthly hell.” That slam was too rarefied to satisfy him, and he lambasted them next in the grittier language of _brother_hood: “I’m tired of preachers riding around in big cars, living in fine homes, but not willing to take their part in the fight … If you can’t stand up with your own people, you are not fit to be a leader.”[^82]

Those remarks read rough, and surely they were. Yet according to Oliver, who was in the room that day, King had impressed Ware and the other Baptists with his humility; he had paid them a certain obeisance simply by leaving Abernathy and Shuttlesworth behind and coming himself. When King was done, the group offered a unanimous vote of support. Yet too triumphal a reading of King’s rescue of the situation may be risky. As the historian Glenn Eskew points out, King may have shamed the ministers, and he may have been too imposing a figure to embarrass publicly, but Ware had managed to take the statement of support for SCLC off the table; instead, the Baptists voted for a diffuse “resolution on the subject of the aspirations of the local Negro group.”[^83]

The next night at the mass meeting, Abernathy reported on that powwow and a similar one with black businessmen:

We had a roomful of the elite, the bourgeoisie, the class of Birmingham who are now living on the hill, learning to talk proper … They’ve got their hair tinted various colors, trying to fool somebody. Year before last they lived like us, across the railroad tracks, took baths in a tin tub, and went to an outhouse. Now they are strutting around proper. How did they get rich? We made them rich … You ought to threaten to cut the preachers’ salaries if they don’t stand up with you for freedom. They say this is the wrong time and yet they have had 350 years. I want to know when the devil gives the right time.[^84]

King’s remarks at the Wednesday mass meeting on April 10 shifted attention back to the hesitant masses. “We have asked every freedom-loving Negro of self-respect in Birmingham, Alabama, to refuse to shop in the stores downtown … But we are asking everybody to live a sacrificial life during this Easter season and even after the Easter season.” To prove it, the usually well-appointed King pointed to his own blue jeans and gray work shirts. “We are not wearing these things merely to engage in some theatrical gesture … [but] to symbolize our determination to sacrifice during this period … We are not going to buy suits or shirts or shoes or socks or anything in the downtown area of Birmingham, Alabama, until the walls of segregation in these stores will crumble. And we intend to keep on keepin’ on until that job is done.”

With its hints of scorn and shame, King’s appeal to “every freedom-loving Negro of self-respect” was a swipe at those Negroes who lacked self-respect and did not love freedom. This turning on black people was unusual for King. Abernathy had no problem calling out “Uncle Toms,” but when King talked about slavish Negroes, he tended to do so tenderly, telling them that every color, from a treble white to a black bass, had worth on God’s keyboard.

King’s escalation of blame was a sign of his growing desperation. “Now we’re asking you, my friends, not only to stop buying yourself but tell your neighbors … When you see any Negro shopping downtown, realize that that Negro doesn’t have any self-respect, and he isn’t fit to be free.” Given that the vast majority of blacks knew about the protests, “that means that anybody who goes downtown to shop is going down in defiance of this movement and they are traitors to the Negro race.”

King’s call for black solidarity reflected his hard-boiled premise: white merchants would not respond to appeals to their conscience. That is why the grand prophet turned to the most prosaic details of boycott mechanics. He even warned of the danger of relapse encouraged by the post-Easter sales, which he conceded “were mighty good.” Succumbing to temptation would allow the merchants to make up their losses and thus destroy their incentive to negotiate. “We must stay away from town until Negroes can eat at any lunch counter in the stores downtown,” he insisted. “We’ve got to spend our dollars where they can make jobs that our boys and our girls [can get]. We don’t have to buy segregation.” To fortify his appeal to black economic power—blacks had to “patronize Negro business”—King aroused feelings of humiliation. “We don’t have to have insurance agents who will come into our homes and disrespect our mothers and our daughters by calling them ‘Ann’ and walking in the house with their hats on…. We don’t have to accept many of the things we accept.”

Despite King’s message of refusal, his mind seemed worried, his spirit weak. Where was the joy in the attacks on “traitors to their race”? In Albany he had proclaimed, “I love every Negro!” Now he was casting out those who were “in defiance of the movement.” Nor did King’s riffs on loving the white man have their usual force. The problem was not with King’s “Oh, I know how difficult it is [to love the white man]” or with the compulsion in “something tells me that I must love Bull Connor, for even Bull Connor is a child of God.” King never held that loving the white man meant you had to _like_ him. But at that moment, it was as if Bull Connor’s diabolical self, refracted through King’s rising pessimism about a victory in Birmingham, was testing King’s capacity to carry out his Savior’s injunction: Love your enemy. Connor’s full status as a fellow human being made in God’s image diminished by the moment. Connor, said King, has “scarred God’s image” and “allowed a great deal of God’s image to be erased.”

The most King could muster was this Christian equivalent of a backhand compliment: “Some of God’s image is still there.”[^85]

[Meet me in Galilee](contents.html#ch01lev1sec4)

Given the small number of blacks who had signed up to go to jail, King’s statement at Wednesday’s mass meeting that “these people are determined to be free” sounded unconvincing, his pledge to “fill up these jails” like empty swagger. Earlier in his address, he had announced, “Ralph Abernathy and I have decided that we would like to feel that we are suffering with Christ in the days he suffered on the cross. And we are going to make our move on Good Friday. And we ask you and we solicit your support as we do this.”[^86]

Sometime after midnight, King, Abernathy, and Shuttlesworth were served with an injunction that forbade “boycotts, sit-ins, parades, picketing and kneel-ins at churches.” In looking to the court for relief, Bull Connor said the black protests “will cause incidents of violence and bloodshed” as well as “irreparable injury to persons and property.” King deemed the injunction unconstitutional and said he would violate it.[^87]

Despite his stated intention to go to jail on Friday, King wavered all day Thursday and into the early hours of Friday. He was struggling with the indecision and despondency that recurrently plagued him. In low moments, he would sometimes call Mahalia Jackson and tell her, “I sure could use some cheering up, Mahalia,” and she would assuage him with a favorite hymn such as “Amazing Grace” or “The Old Rugged Cross.” At other times, he’d steal away to mistresses or seek a massage from the old blind man at the Auburn Avenue YMCA. In a Selma mass meeting, he began preaching the titanic struggle between the despair of midnight and morning’s hope and then improvised a verse of “There Is a Balm in Gilead”: “Sometimes I feel discouraged in Alabama, / Sometimes I feel discouraged in Mississippi, / Sometimes I feel discouraged in this struggle, / Sometimes I feel my work’s in vain. / But then the holy spirit / revives my soul again. / There is a balm in Gilead, / to make the wounded whole.”[^88]

None of that balm was evident in the meeting early on Good Friday morning in King’s Gaston Motel room. Nor was there any of the zeal he was about to hallow in the “Letter.” He and his colleagues were engaged in a game of cost accounting, tallying the risks and returns of going to jail or not going to jail.

“As we talked,” King later wrote, “a sense of doom began to pervade the room. I looked about me and saw that, for the first time, our most dedicated and devoted leaders were overwhelmed by a feeling of hopelessness. No one knew what to say, for no one knew what to do.” As King reconstructed it, “I thought about the people in jail. I thought about the Birmingham Negroes already lining the streets of the city, waiting to see me put into practice what I had so passionately preached.” But if King went to jail, who would raise the bail money for the three hundred freedom fighters who had done the sacrificial deed? “I sat in the midst of the deepest quiet I have ever felt.”[^89]

King retreated to a back bedroom. At one point, Andrew Young peeked in; he could see King stretched out on the bed, a pillow over his head. King’s mind was racing beyond jail and even Birmingham. “I thought of twenty million black people who dreamed that someday they might be able to cross the Red Sea of injustice and find their way to the promised land of integration and freedom.” And so with this intimation of Canaan, King put on his blue jeans and work shirt—his going to jail outfit—and returned to his people. “I don’t know what will happen; I don’t know where the money will come from. But I have to make a faith act.” Then everybody in the room linked hands and sang “We Shall Overcome.”[^90]

Despite the Exodus imagery, the Passion better captured the meaning of King’s decision. He would suffer so that others could be redeemed. But what is the appropriate emotion for the Passion: anguish over Christ’s agony or joy at the ultimate sacrifice? And what was Christ feeling as he was dragged up the hill on the cross?

In the bitterness that spilled out of King in the days before Good Friday, he seemed to be resenting all those free-riding Negroes who sang “I’m on my way to freedom land” but then left the sacrifice to him. A few weeks earlier, while preaching at Ebenezer, right after King spoke God’s rebuff of Moses, “Wherefore cryeth thou unto me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward,” he had God follow up with a more vernacular command, and the irritation in King’s voice is palpable as he assumes God’s voice: “Don’t sit around waiting for me to do it all by myself.”[^91] That wasn’t God chiding the Israelites; that was King chiding black people.

Of course, Christianity celebrates free riding, _for others_: I shall die so you can live. But King was clearly not enjoying the role of martyr. Wasn’t that why he had lashed out at his brothers and sisters who were not “fit to be free”?

As King agonized over his decision, it was Abernathy who sounded joyously ready to act. At the Wednesday meeting at which King decried “traitors to the race,” Abernathy was his jocular self. He quipped that he wasn’t feeling well because he had been in jail seven times “for the freedom of my people. And I have never been in the Birmingham jail.” Then he began his faux whining: The leaders said he couldn’t go to jail today, he couldn’t go tomorrow, he had to wait until Good Friday, “and it gave me a headache.” In other words, he was aching to go to jail.[^92]

“I’m feeling better tonight because tomorrow I’m goin’ to jail,” Abernathy announced at the Thursday night mass meeting. As a paralyzed King remained at the Gaston Motel pondering, Abernathy gave an extraordinary burst of freedom preaching, evoking each step of Christ’s crucifixion until “he got up!” He commanded, “Tell Bull Connor to get the cell ready.” On the recording, his voice sounds at peace and full of resolve: “Martin Luther King and I will be there tomorrow. Are you going to march with us? I been with him in the fiery furnace, I’m not going to let him down now. I been with him in the Lion’s Den, I’m not going to let him down. I been with him on Patmos Island, I’m not going to let him down … We don’t care what comes our way, it’s not gonna stop us ’cause tomorrow is Good Friday.”

Suddenly, Abernathy swerved. “Somebody here ought to know what I’m talking about,” and the audience punctuated each of Abernathy’s gently rocking, wavelike phrases with their assent:

And I’m thinkin’ about a man one day

who stooped down at the foot of the mountain

and took a cross on his shoulder

and tuggle it up the rugged brow of God’s

[undecipherable] hills.

And it got heavy.

And sweat like drops of blood ran down,

but he never said a mumblin’ word.

Went on up the hill with the cross on his shoulder,

and when he got up on top of the hill,

they drove spikes in his hands.

They drove nails in his feet.

They pierced him in the side.

They spat in his face.

They placed a thorny crown on his head.

And it got so dark

that at three o’clock in the afternoon,

the chickens went to the roostin’ pole.

The world reeled and rocked like a guilty man.

And he cried out,

“My God, my God,

why hath thou forsaken me?”

And had not a tomb to be buried in.

But somebody always cares.

For Joseph begged his body,

and laid it in the tomb,

to put the seal of the government on the tomb.

And he stayed there all Friday night.

It was dark and lonely Friday night.

The chronicle was so vivid that it felt as if Abernathy had been there when they crucified his Lord. He told how Peter and James and John wandered off; he took the audience through the darkness of Saturday, the wrestling in hell with the devil, took them right on through to Sunday when “my God got up” and the stone rolled away.

When God gets ready to move,

no man can stop him.

When God gets ready to move,

the dogs can’t stop him. And said,

“All power in heaven and earth is in my hands.

“Go tell my disciples,

“Go tell Martin Luther King,

“Go tell Ralph Abernathy,

“To meet us in Galilee.”

I’ll be there on tomorrow morning.

Will you be there?[^93]

On Friday afternoon, after that melancholy session at the Gaston Motel, King, Abernathy, and Shuttlesworth strode out the doors of the Sixth Street Zion Baptist Church. Fewer than fifty brave souls accompanied them as they headed off to jail. The streets were lined with a thousand blacks, some dressed for the occasion in their Easter finest, some dropping to their knees, others falling in behind the line of the march.

Did the crowds ease the pain of King’s lonely sacrifice or inflame it? Capturing the expressions well, Glenn Eskew writes: “A sense of foreboding clouded King’s countenance. A smiling Abernathy tried to dispel his friend’s doubts, while Shuttlesworth strolled along with easy assurance.”[^94]

They hadn’t gone far before Bull Connor barked, “Stop them.” Abernathy remembered, “Holding each of us by the seat of his pants,” they propelled us toward a waiting paddy wagon, lifted us in the air, and tossed us inside like a couple of sacks of meal.” As they waited in the dark, they could hear screams and shouting. Suddenly, somebody was declaring the Birmingham jail close to bursting. And then they heard the voice of Connor: “OK, don’t arrest another goddamn nigger.” He ordered King and Abernathy placed in different cells. “These two have never been separated. They’re the Gold Dust Twins. Let’s see if they can get along without one another for a change. Put them in solitary.” King muttered, “He’s a smart old cracker.”[^95]

Over the next few hours, bystanders enraged by the rough treatment of King and of other protesters threw bricks. Andrew Young and his assistant Dorothy Cotton struggled to keep a lid on things. This was not just the rougher element but their own supporters who seemed to be losing their restraint. Once back inside the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, Cotton, a gifted freedom singer, channeled the crowd’s rage into the lyrics of “Oh, freedom, oh, freedom, oh, freedom over me. And before I’d be a slave, I’d be buried in my grave, and go home to my Lord and be free.” Although Young was still shaken by the brutal treatment of King and the others and the outbreak of violence, he argued that if blacks were going to win “this fight … we must win it by elevating our white brothers and sisters to a new moral level. We cannot win if we sink to their level.”[^96]

Later that night at the mass meeting, as King lay in darkness in the Birmingham jail, Young introduced James Bevel, the SCLC wild man with the shaved head who wore a yarmulke in homage to the Old Testament prophets. Bevel had just arrived from Mississippi, which had quieted down just enough to spare him. Young quipped: “It’s disappointin’ to me, because I never thought I’d see the day when white folks in Mississippi got more sense than white folks in Alabama.” He had been with Bevel “about three weeks ago the night that the [white] folks shot up Greenwood, Mississippi. And it’s amazing that folks can pull right alongside of you over there with a machine gun and can shoot through the windows and blow out windows on this side of the car and on that side of the car and don’t hit anybody in between. And I said when I was over there, ‘I don’t mind coming over here either because I know the Lord is bending bullets in Mississippi.’”

That King, Abernathy, and Shuttlesworth were in jail was on everybody’s mind. At one point during the meeting, an anxious speaker reported that King was being held incommunicado and his lawyer could not get in to see him. But, Young consoled the audience, “if brother Connor doesn’t hurry up and let Doctor King and Reverend Abernathy and Reverend Shuttlesworth out of that jail so that we can go on about our business in other places, before long we’re going to have folks coming in here from all over … it won’t be long before the merchants will be coming down to Mr. Connor saying, ‘Brother Bull, I think we better pay off some of this bail and get these niggers out of jail.’”[^97]

On most of his jail stints, King pursued a varied regimen. He usually fasted. In Selma, after presiding over a Quaker type of meeting, he and the others sang freedom songs, and then King became the sounding board for the grievances of the regular prisoners. He and Abernathy were prayer partners, as Abernathy’s wife, Juanita, described it, and they often preached to each other. King liked his creature comforts, especially loved to eat, and in Albany, he savored the sumptuous meals of fried chicken, biscuits, potato salad, and apple pie that the local black women kept flowing. On another occasion, King even debated intermarriage and white supremacy with the warden and guards. “And when those brothers told me what they were earning, I said, ‘Now, you know what? You ought to be marching with us. You’re just as poor as Negroes.’”[^98]

This jailing was different. King was placed alone in a dark cell, with no mattress, and denied a phone call. Was Connor’s aim, as some thought, to break him? If so, he succeeded, temporarily. The somber concision of King’s confession to a black church right after he got out of jail—“It was kinda tough, they made it hard on us”—hinted at the depths of his suffering.[^99]

This wasn’t the first time the civil rights leader had a hard time in prison. As Stanley Levison reflected, “Solitary was the hardest thing for him. When he was cut off from people, he really went into a depression … When he was cut off from them he worried … he brooded, he felt bewildered. He told me one time that he broke down completely in solitary.” Andrew Young attributed King’s “almost paralyzing fear of being alone in jail” to a traumatic experience in 1960 while in the De Kalb County, Georgia, jail. He was seized in the middle of the night and “placed in a straightjacket, thrown in the back of a paddy wagon, and driven across the state to the prison at Reidsville. All this was done without any explanation.” Although King didn’t talk much about it, late one night he told Young, “‘I knew I’d never see anybody again. That kind of mental anguish is worse than dying, riding for mile after mile, hungry and thirsty, bound and helpless, waiting and not knowing what you’re waiting for’ … Martin never quite got over that experience. He always knew that in jail alone, he was extremely vulnerable, and he was more afraid of that kind of prolonged mental anguish than he was of dying.”[^100]

As King lay in the darkness of the Birmingham jail, he spiraled down once more into the midnight of his soul. “Those were the longest, most frustrating and bewildering hours I have lived,” King later wrote. “Having no contact of any kind, I was besieged with worry … In the mornings the sun would rise, sending shafts of light through the window high in the narrow cell which was my home. You will never know the meaning of utter darkness until you have lain in such a dungeon, knowing that sunlight is streaming overhead and still seeing only darkness below. You might have thought I was in the grip of a fantasy brought on by worry.”[^101]

How many times had King reassured his people, “You go to jail and turn the dungeon of shame into a haven of freedom”? This time, the cell had become a dungeon of despondency.

At some point during the weekend, King recounted later, a black trustee sneaked him a Birmingham newspaper along with his breakfast. Opening the paper, King happened upon “A Call for Unity” by eight of Alabama’s leading white clergymen. They included two Episcopalian bishops, two Methodist bishops, the pastor of First Baptist Church of Birmingham, a leader of the Alabama Presbyterian Church, the Catholic auxiliary bishop of the Mobile-Birmingham Diocese, and the rabbi of the Reform Temple Emanu-El, Birmingham. Every one of them had signed the January “An Appeal for Law and Order and Common Sense” that urged obedience to court decisions that ordered desegregation.[^102]

The signers of the statement roundly repudiated King’s campaign in Birmingham as “unwise and untimely.” While ceding “the natural impatience of people who feel that their hopes are slow in being realized,” they condemned the lawbreaking, advised pursuing complaints through the courts, and warned that the protests “incite to hatred and violence … We do not believe that these days of new hope are days when extreme measures are justified in Birmingham.” They also praised the “calm manner” in which law enforcement and the local news media had “handled the protests.” Their conclusion echoed the central theme of their January statement: “We appeal to both our white and Negro citizenry to observe the principles of law and order and common sense.”[^103]

We need to stop a moment and try to imagine King as he read the words of his fellow clergymen. Right up to the minute of his jailing, he felt disappointed and betrayed by blacks and whites alike. He felt the solitude of the Negro people before the indifference of America. Everybody, from the _New York Times_ and the Kennedys to Albert Boutwell and Billy Graham, from the black professional classes to the local black ministers, had been telling him to wait. He had barely slept in days and had been fasting. The exhaustion, worry, and depression of the entire campaign had given way in jail to primal dread and loneliness. And now these fellow men of the cloth virtually mocked his beloved nonviolence as merely “technically peaceful.” They even accused him of inciting violence while praising Bull Connor for restraint.

As angry as King may have been at the clergymen, he owed them greatly. Their statement energized him. Before long, he was surging up out of his valley of despair on a flood of indignation. When King recreated that moment for a black audience just forty-eight hours out of jail, the anger was still raw. “And I read where seven or eight of the leading white ministers here signed a statement saying that our movement is untimely. Untimely,” he repeated, his voice full of cold fury, and then he recalled, “ ‘Why didn’t you wait and give the new government time to act?’ Well, all I have to say is that we’ve been waiting long enough. The Negro has never heard anything but the word ‘wait.’ And wait has almost always meant never … That’s all we’ve heard. Wait! Wait for a more convenient season.”[^104]

Among the first of King’s colleagues to get to see him in jail, Clarence Jones, one of his lawyers, found him still “agitated” when he met with him on Monday, April 15. Although King had finally been released from solitary and placed in a regular cell, he was so wrought up he could not focus on his central concern before he went to jail, bail money for the three hundred prisoners. “Have you seen this?” King demanded, shoving the newspaper at Jones. He could see that King had already written comments right on the paper.[^105]

Others might have shrugged off the criticism. Why worry about a bunch of white preachers? many of King’s colleagues wondered. Wyatt Tee Walker dismissed the clergymen: “I had anger toward them. I felt they were hypocrites. It’s what I expected from white preachers.” Jones’s first instinct was to judge King’s letter writing a waste of time, but he ceded its therapeutic power. “I figured he was entitled to it—you know, a man in jail,” Jones later recalled. “But Lord have mercy, I thought he had lost his perspective.”[^106]

King couldn’t let it go. As Jones argued for dealing with first things first, King said, “I have to answer this.” Jones stuffed his shirt and pants with the newspaper jottings and ferried them to Walker.[^107]

Later that day King got a brief rest from working on the “Letter.” He was summoned to a phone call from his wife, Coretta. “Hear everything, you know” was King’s guarded reply after she had asked, “Are you being guarded?” They engaged in the small talk of domestic intimacies. King asked, “How’s the baby? How is Bernice?” and his wife told him the newborn was “fine, growing and cute as a button.” She wanted to know if he was taking vitamins; on this April 15, he wanted to know if she had mailed their tax returns. At moments, hints of his suffering peeked through. “How do you feel?” Coretta asked, and King’s reply—“All right”—appeared to provoke her to repeat the question: “Is your spirit all right?” Perhaps signaling her, he said, “Yes, I’ve been alone, you know.”[^108]

There are equal hints in the call, as King’s bristling to Clarence Jones before the call prefigured, that King was already back in the struggle. Coretta told her husband that she had called Bobby Kennedy and that not long afterward, the phone rang, “and it was the President himself, and he assured me of his concern.” Perking up, King told her to “get that to the Reverend [Walker]. I think it will make a very good statement.” Kennedy apparently had pressed his case for patience; although he prefaced it with a display of sympathy, and he did it subtly, it was not so subtle that Coretta did not grasp it immediately. She told King, “He’s very sympathetic and kept saying, ‘How are you, I understand you have a little baby.’ He said things might get better with the new [Boutwell] administration. This is a problem.” King returned to his concern about the media coverage—“Is it being carried well?”—and later repeated his earlier wish: “Be sure to get in touch with the Reverend. I think it will make a very good statement.”[^109]

Because King was initially deprived of writing paper, he poured his first rejoinders onto the margins of the newspaper and then onto toilet tissue. Prison offered one advantage in this regard, notes Andrew Young wryly: The toilet paper was rough enough to write on. After a few days, King gained access to writing paper, a pen, and an array of smuggling lawyers. Part of a transmission belt between King and Walker, they relayed King’s initial drafts and later corrections to Walker, who deciphered King’s chicken scratch scrawl and the arabesques of arrows indicating the flow of the argument. He then translated them for his secretary, who typed them before Walker sent them back to King in prison.[^110]

All the while, says Andrew Young, “the young lady who was typing it was cussing and fussing because, well, she was just about seventeen, from Vidalia, Georgia, and she didn’t know what it was and didn’t know the words. She said, ‘Dr. King can preach but he sure can’t write.’” One night Walker found the secretary slumped over her typewriter asleep. He gathered her up, put her down in another chair, and continued the typing. For those in the midst of this frenzy, the chaos of the production line blunted any inkling of its future historical stature. “None of us,” says Young, “understood the significance of it. So she’d finish a page and crumple it up and throw it in the trash can and nobody stopped her.”[^111]

King’s indignation kept the words flowing. “There comes a time when people get tired,” King had declared on countless occasions over the years. Now it was personal.

As Walker summarized it, borrowing the metaphor King had applied to black people only a few days previously, “His cup [of endurance] runneth over.[^112][PART TWO](contents.html#part02)

## The “Letter”]]

[Chapter Two](contents.html#ch02)

### Diplomat]]

[My Dear Fellow Clergymen](contents.html#ch02lev1sec1)

“My Dear Fellow Clergymen.”[^1] These are Martin Luther King, Jr.’s very first words to the men who have inflamed him. Given his frazzled state of mind when he starts writing the “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” that overture seems remarkable. How can one square the image of a reckless agitator with the precious formality of his greeting? Where is the angry black man in the acknowledgment of their shared vocation? Have the clergymen decried him as an extremist? King calls them “men of genuine good will.” He honors their motives too; their criticisms are “sincerely set forth.” He then pledges his effort to reciprocate by answering them in “patient and reasonable terms.” This capacity for initial niceties is disarming, to say the least; it reflects handsomely on this cultivated, gracious, and learned man whose refusal to dive right in indicates an extraordinary control over the emotions roiling within. The three sections of this chapter examine the creativity and the variety of all the efforts of King the diplomat to keep his eye on the prize and use that ample restraint to win over his adversaries.

King’s restraint doesn’t flag after the first paragraph. He entertains the charge that he is an outsider who doesn’t speak for the Negroes of that city for three entire paragraphs. He notes ingenuously, it seems “you have been influenced by the view which argues against ‘outsiders coming in.’” He even seems to concede the point of their chiding and goes on in an almost legalistic vein: He isn’t _really_ an outsider; the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights is an affiliate of SCLC: _I have ties here_; _I was invited here_. Talk about turning the other cheek: They have disputed the legitimacy of his presence in Birmingham; he refuses to dispute the validity of their questioning his legitimacy. He gives them the gift of his time and energy, taking their objections seriously enough to justify himself to them.

Finally King drops this contrived line and gets down to the essential thing: the duty of each person to every other person, to humanity itself. This is only one of the reasons why the “Letter” is so much more than the moral brief for civil disobedience to which it is often reduced. It has even more ambitions than providing a rationale for the civil rights movement or at least the Christian corner of it.

King is at his most sublime here. “I am here in Selma,” King will declare two years later in a black church, “because my people are suffering.” In the “Letter,” King uses that same beginning, “I am in Birmingham,” and then divests it of any ethnic motive—“because injustice exists here.” King repeats this theme in a number of different keys. I am, says King, like “the prophets of the eighth century B.C. [who] left their villages and carried their ‘thus saith the Lord’ far afield.”

As if a single Testament weren’t enough, this is where he says, “And just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco-Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my home town.” King immediately moves to another of Paul’s aspects, not the evangelist Paul, or “Prisoner Paul,” as Paul describes himself in Philemon, or even the letter writer Paul, but Paul the Samaritan. “And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.”[^2] “Like Paul,” says King in the “Letter” “I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.”

To drive home the breadth of his reach, King fortifies these rationales with less biblical aphorisms. But each is a barely disguised expression of his religious conviction. Like “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” “I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham” repeats the theme of Paul’s duty to respond to the Macedonian cry for help. That “we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny,” is a fancier, secular way of saying what King said when he preached the parable of Dives and Lazarus. It is not Dives’s wealth that makes him a sinner in King’s mind; his sin is to stride by the gimpy beggar Lazarus, covered with oozing lesions and suffering the pangs of hunger, as if he were invisible. The sin is failing to recognize any of God’s children.[^3]

This was not so far from the twist King gave to the story of the Good Samaritan while preaching. The priest and the Levite both rushed by the man left for dead on the Jericho Road. They saw “only a bleeding body.” But the Samaritan, who was a half-breed from an alien race, as King renders him, and a race with which the Jews had no truck, crossed the chasm that separated the two men. He saw the beaten, bloody man as a person in need, “as a human being first, who was a Jew only by accident.” Who, then, was a neighbor? King would ask in the most diverse situations. He is “any needy man” on the “Jericho Roads of life.”[^4]

Two key ideas come together in the opening paragraphs of the “Letter.” First, King is mirroring those slaves who answered the question in their spiritual “And did not my Lord deliver Daniel?” with another question, “And why not every man?” To this note of universalism, King adds a more active requirement that we have already encountered in the Birmingham meetings and at Ebenezer Baptist Church. It is not enough to say that all people are God’s children and thus deserve freedom and recognition; you have a duty to do something about it. This is the gospel of freedom, plain and simple. Call it the existential version of deliverance.

Having established the grandest principles that underlie the gospel of freedom, King turns to the clergymen’s next concern, which strikes at the tactical core of the movement: “You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham.” If King has just disposed of the outsider part of that fearsome epithet “outside agitator,” now he confronts the agitator part and all the loathsome associations that Southerners and others have packed into the term: otherness, disorder, tension, trouble, evil. Of course, it is hard to separate these two components. In an act of turnaround, the defenders of the status quo often accused the civil rights protests of disturbing some mythical equilibrium of “brotherly relations” between the races in the South. If that wasn’t outrageous enough, in their Good Friday statement the white clergy had savaged King as irresponsible and the protests as actions that “incite hatred and violence.”

King maintains his solicitous stance as he tries to convince the clergy that he has not rashly resorted to protest. He offers a didactic primer on nonviolent protest, detailing the complex process that precedes heading to the barricades. In effect, this whole exercise is a ritual of reassurance: _See, we are the opposite of reckless_.

King does not waste a lot of time on the first step: the fact-finding the movement carried out to determine if there was injustice. But the second stage should have made the clergy especially happy, as King tells them how diligently the movement has tried negotiation. This was true, as we have already seen. Early in the fall of 1962, King reminds them, Fred Shuttlesworth and the ACMHR engaged the department store owners to set forth their grievances. King is referring here to that September meeting at which Shuttlesworth said that the movement was long past water and the Sears manager called his store to have the humiliating White Only sign on the bathroom painted over. Their grievances centered on the architecture of humiliation: the lack of changing rooms for blacks to try on clothes, the segregated lunch counters, the signs that marked separate water fountains and restrooms for whites and for blacks. In many of the stores, blacks had no access to bathrooms at all, and countless mothers had suffered the embarrassment of their children who could wait no longer and had to relieve themselves outdoors in public.

This was the source of another kind of “facts of life” that could make for awkwardness when black parents finally got around to holding “the conversation” with their children. How to explain these everyday arrangements that were based on the premise of their inferiority? Right before King’s arrest, Shuttlesworth joked about his intention of sampling some of that delicious white water. He was trying to drain the notion of separation of its power to hurt by imagining its imminent death.

On the basis of promises made by the store owners to remove “humiliating racial signs,” King explains in the “Letter,” the movement declared a moratorium on demonstrations. They quickly discovered that the signs either were never removed or were put back. “As the weeks and months went by we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise … As in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and our disappointment was keenly felt.”

From the start, the very idea of blacks and whites sitting down together to negotiate the end of racial separation was a dicey and even absurd affair. To mock the segregationists’ fixation on black men’s lust for white women, Ralph Abernathy liked to look around mass meetings, note the varied complexions, and point out that it was _the white man_ “who has tried to be our brother-in-law.” Gathering around a table may not have been as dire as sexual commingling, but this was Birmingham, where the idea of black and white saliva mixing in a shared water fountain could provoke panic or disgust. When Shuttlesworth presented supportive white students from Birmingham—Southern College at a mass meeting, Bull Connor’s police observer could not keep from noting the physical contact: “Shuttlesworth was standing between the two white girls and put his arm around both of them. Of course, when he did that, every Negro in the church came out of his seat hollering, screaming, and applauding.”[^5]

Then there was the problem of negotiating under the threat of terrorist reprisals. A number of the store owners were Jewish and especially nervous about their own betwixt-and-between status in a city crowded with violent racists who were also fulminating anti-Semites. At least one of the Jewish owners was privately happy to integrate the dressing rooms of his department store under “duress,” the activist minister Herbert Oliver was told by his father, but was beaten bloody by the Klan despite his “excuse” for doing so. He quickly retracted his assent.[^6]

The complexities of negotiation would not stop with King’s jailing. In the second week of April, Sidney Smyer agreed to meet with some of the movement leaders. The air-conditioned room was chilly, and when one of the few white liberals in the city, Charles Morgan, offered his coat to a cold Fred Shuttlesworth, Smyer visibly grimaced. Then he said, “Tell me, what is it that you niggers want?” Morgan responded, “Well, one thing—probably they don’t want to be called ‘niggers.’”[^7]

In the “Letter,” after telling the clergymen about his blasted hopes, King explains with equanimity that he was still reluctant to pull the trigger on the protests. A third stage of self-purification intervened before the fourth and final stage of demonstration. If anything should have underlined that King and his colleagues were utterly noble Christians, it should have been all the efforts the movement took to imbue demonstrators with an ethos of virtually masochistic forbearance. “We repeatedly asked ourselves: ‘Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?’ ‘Are you able to endure the ordeal of jail?’”

This echoed King’s famous porch speech after the 1956 bombing of his house during the Montgomery bus boycott. Following that attack, a crowd of blacks eager for revenge gathered, but he told them, “Remember the words of Jesus: ‘He who lives by the sword will perish by the sword.’ I then urged them to leave peacefully. ‘We must love our white brothers,’ I said, no matter what they do to us. We must make them know that we love them. Jesus still cries out in words that echo across the centuries: ‘Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; pray for them that despitefully use you.’”[^8]

Long before King had come to Birmingham, Fred Shuttlesworth had preached a version of that message. “Against the racist’s hate and scorn we are using the love of Christ, against his oppressive and abusive acts we are using the weapon of Prayer on whose mystic wings we sweep into the presence of God to lay out our troubles. Thus we are never tempted to hate white people or to return them evil for evil … Always remember that we are healed by the ‘wounds in His side,’ not by wounds we inflict upon others.”[^9]

Even after these efforts to cleanse vengeful impulses, the movement still did not race into battle. This, of course, was when the movement faced the conflict between its own schedule of righteousness and practical concerns about risking the election of Bull Connor as mayor. So they waited, and when Connor fell into a runoff with Boutwell, they waited again, despite palpable risks of dissipating momentum. King justifies these decisions in the “Letter” by portraying himself to the clergymen as a responsible steward of the entire community. “We did not move irresponsibly into direct action. Like many others, we wanted to see Mr. Connor defeated, and to this end, we endured postponement after postponement.” Only after they had “aided in this community need” did they resort to the protests.

Amazingly, King remains as affable as ever as he responds in the “Letter” to his critics. Again, he steps into their shoes, respectfully anticipating their anxious concern. “You may well ask, ‘Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches, etc.? Isn’t negotiation a better path?’”

As we saw, the clergymen were not the only ones to fret about protest. _Time_ magazine had accused King of “inflaming tensions” at a time of seeming progress. Such drama is precisely what the Kennedy administration continually sought to quash. Cool to demonstrations, it tried to divert protests into other channels, especially legal ones, which it took as less disruptive than direct action. In the war with communism, it knew that such “dramatizations” were a global embarrassment and didn’t play well in the competition for the hearts and minds of the third world; that is why King continually raised the specter of a larger Asian, Latin American, and African world that was watching.

King’s initial salvo is an appeal to a masked consensus. Maybe he and the clergy disagree about means, but not about ends: “You are quite right in calling for negotiations.” He tells the clergymen that the very purpose of protest—and all the things that follow from it, including fostering tension—is to hasten negotiation. Demonstrations aim to force “a community which has constantly refused to negotiate” to confront injustice. The purpose of nonviolent direct action is to “create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.” Once again, the ever other-directed King anticipates the clergy’s reaction in order to minister to it. “Citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking.”

King’s task here is nothing less than to celebrate the virtues of that fearsome state, but in his typically roundabout way and with a lot of help from authorities who might mollify the critics. “Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could shake off the bondage of myths and half truths and rise to the realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal,” nonviolent gadflies help “men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.” In short, protests are not a repudiation of negotiation but their midwife. Better still, they are instruments of enlightenment.

As King calmly, methodically, sets out these building blocks, one senses something simmering that could threaten his equilibrium. Despite the appearance of decorous calm, the poetic resonance in his account of negotiations betrayed—“our hopes had been blasted”—hints at the emotions churning below the reflective surface of his pedagogy of nonviolence.

Even before he starts his primer on direct action, King points to the elephant in the room: “Your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations.” Then the former sociology major patronizes them with a tacit sneer. “I am sure none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes.” Despite the seeming deference in King’s empathy with the clergy’s recoil from the word “tension,” he not only embraces that term proudly but implies the clergy lack courage. “I am not afraid of the word ‘tension,’” he says, perhaps with a subtle emphasis on “I.” He establishes superiority in one final way. In forcing the clergymen to confront uncomfortable truths, King offers himself as a social therapist who will free them from the “bondage of myth” so they can achieve a higher state of consciousness.

The adept teacher is thus a cocky one, even if he has kept that cockiness under wraps. And the cocky teacher is a tricky one too, for there is a trap contained in all this didacticism. First, King seems to honor his critics by accepting their premise: Negotiations are good. Then he takes it somewhere they do not intend: You need demonstrations to get to negotiation. King now closes out this portion of the “Letter” by closing the distance between them. “I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.” Hoist by your own petard! Better yet, hijacked to the other guy’s conclusion.

“Our beloved southland” is not quite raising the Confederate flag or singing “Swanee.” Likely, it slyly alludes to the white clerics’ January statement on law and order in which they expressed sympathy for the “cherished customs of our beloved Southland.” If so, more than a hint of the badass is at work there. And there is a bit of badass antics in the very raid on the concept, the laying out a black claim not just to the southland itself but to the values that should infuse it. But whether “our beloved southland” is Delphic or just plain disingenuous, it is the perfect complement to “My Dear Fellow Clergymen.” They both serve as nice touches that help maintain a bit of communion in the midst of tense disagreement. Despite the argument that tension can be creative that King has just made, with the help of Socrates, he constantly looks for ways to assuage it with manners, at least once the point has been made.

And so the politeness continues, especially but not only, in the first half of the “Letter,” in a dozen ways: in King’s circumspection, in his little markers of respect (“my friends,” “My Jewish and Christian brothers”), in words like “lamentably” that convey he is not really spoiling for a fight, in his willingness to let his critics save face by treating them as misguided rather than as enemies, in his tendency to say he is “disappointed” when he is furious, in the indirect way he sometimes defines his targets not by name but as general archetypes like “moderates,” in his reassurance that “my tears have been tears of love,” and in his hope at the end that “the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.”

The most extraordinary instance of such graciousness comes toward the close of the “Letter.” King seems to be wondering if he has overstated things? Maybe he _has_ been impatient? Given how powerful the struggle for black self-esteem has been and how increasingly that quest has centered on assertions of black manhood and defiance, what follows is truly remarkable: “If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me.” It is not just Malcolm X and the inchoate nationalists who abjured any hint of obsequiousness; it is hard to imagine even the young activists in SNCC, the students in the sit-in movement, or Fred Shuttlesworth going around begging and apologizing to the white man.

We’ll return later to the begging. For now, it bears keeping in mind that King’s mannerliness was more than a rhetorical conceit. It was part of a larger other-directedness that informed his approach to the white power structure. In _Stride Toward Freedom_, his account of the Montgomery bus boycott, King went to great lengths to display sensitivity to white fears, to depersonalize conflict, to stress that the struggle was not between black and white but between justice and injustice. Their opponents, King stressed, were not “bad men.”[^10]

Andrew Young brought this same mannerly sensibility right into the heart of the negotiations he held with Birmingham whites. “Our first meeting was designed to show the local religious and business representatives that we did not sprout horns. I always made it a point to change out of my blue jean overalls into a business suit for these meetings—these were mature men of wealth and standing in their community and I was a thirty-one year-old preacher.” He looked on the white leaders as “people in a bad situation” rather than as “bad people.” “I was determined to be respectful and keep them always focused on the issues rather than give them any reason to form negative perceptions of me.”[^11]

Even in an organization founded on Christian nonviolence like SCLC, not everyone could boast King’s or Young’s capacity for the self-control required by manners. “No one coveted [the job of negotiating with whites],” Young recalled. “They thought it was a waste of time and perceived it as ‘sucking up to the white folks.’” When Fred Shuttlesworth and a colleague spotted Young done up in his suit and tie heading out to negotiate, they cracked wise: “Andy’s going to Tom.” An amused Young told them, “‘Any of you all are welcome to go with me, come on.’ But going to negotiate with white folks was not their idea of a good time.”[^12]

It’s a testimony to Andrew Young’s extraordinary confidence that he implemented this strategy in Birmingham under some of the most trying conditions imaginable. As he saw it, this was less obsequiousness than the reverse, a sense of personal and racial self-assurance that didn’t let defensive emotional displays interfere with keeping your eye on the prize. He owed much of it to his father’s brand of dignified defiance. “My father taught me that putting white people at ease was a survival skill that signaled my superior intellect rather than inferior social status.” Young remembers once when the Birmingham merchants were ventilating—it may have been the occasion when Smyer asked, “What do you niggers want?”—and one of the eight clergymen who signed the Good Friday criticism of the movement, Bishop George Murray, was present. Young held his peace, let them carry on, and then chose his preferred moment to intervene and gain his end.[^13]

Ultimately, the manners implied the theology and the theology implied the manners, and both were practical in advancing black aims. This entanglement was never more evident than in the rules of interaction inculcated by the Birmingham movement in the training sessions. King considered the pledge card that participants had to sign so important that he included it in his 1964 book on the Birmingham movement, _Why We Can’t Wait_. The catechism of nonviolence required insurgents to “meditate daily on the teachings and life of Jesus,” to remember the goal was not victory but justice and reconciliation, to “walk and talk in the manner of love, for God is love,” and to “pray daily to be used by God in order that all men might be free.” Nor did the pledge card stint on reminders of mannerliness. It obliged the insurgents to “refrain from the violence” not just of fist but of tongue and heart and to “observe with both friend and foe the ordinary rules of courtesy.”[^14]

[The Word “Wait” Rings in the Ear of Every Negro](contents.html#ch02lev1sec2)

As King bats down the charge of outside agitator, his patience with the clergy seems inexhaustible. But as he moves through his to-do list of refutation and alights on the next clergy complaint—“the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. Some have asked, ‘Why didn’t you give the new city administration time to act?’”—King’s composure is sorely tested.

Intensifying King’s chagrin, the white clergy were hardly alone in having raised the “Why now?” question. Recall that the Kennedy administration, major news magazines and newspapers, and local black clergymen and businessmen all had advised waiting. The demands for delay kept coming while King remained in jail. _Time_ magazine deemed the Birmingham insurgency “poorly timed protest.” The _New York Times_ editorialized: “We do not expect that there will be overnight rejection of the policies that caused so much distress to the Negro community” and “Dr. King … ought not expect it either.” In one fell swoop, the paper had seized the role of arbiter of black expectations, ratcheted them radically downward, falsely imputed to King grandiose hopes for “overnight” change, and then tacitly scolded him for such fantastic urgency.[^15]

These criticisms cut King to the quick. He has been preaching, orating, and writing against waiting since he became the leader of the Montgomery bus boycott. At the very first meeting of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the line that touched off a frenzied response was King’s pronouncement “[T]here comes a time when people get tired.” Two days after he got out of the Birmingham jail he reprised, before a black mass meeting audience, a version of that same “There comes a time” refrain before shifting to the drumbeat “Now is the time.” When he recounted for that black audience his initial reaction to reading the “Letter,” the first thing he told them was that the clergymen had called the movement “untimely” and asked, “Why didn’t you wait?”

With his ire ever ready to well up, King throws the charge of extravagant expectations right back at his critics. “We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham.” For the most part, an unflappable King draws from his reserves of good cheer and says calmly, “The new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one.” Bull Connor, who has been mocked and lampooned in the mass meetings—“ole Bull’s gonna be put out to pasture” or that Revelation quip, “I hear he teaches Sunday school. Well[,] tomorrow he’s going to see a number that no man can number”—gets the dignity of a “Mr.” before his name. A seemingly sunny King even voices his accord with the clergy’s hope that Boutwell might act reasonably once in office, in the process validating his own reasonableness as a man driven by facts who won’t let prejudgment foreclose optimism.

King concedes that “Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor.” This “gentleness” had impressed many of the city’s elites, the downtown business types, and the country club people, who had become uncomfortable with Connor’s redneck menace. The clergy’s reference to “a new day” in their Good Friday statement alluded to the progress a Boutwell defeat of Connor promised the city. Failing to mention that the new mayor was a segregationist, the same _New York Times_ editorial that lectured King not to be impatient saw Boutwell’s election as grounds for hope for a more “enlightened” day. While King was still in jail, another _Times_ piece contrasted the buoyant mood of the Boutwell swearing-in ceremony—“like a picnic, with the giggles of little girls”—with “racial tensions that have grown alarmingly the last few days” and “the sounds of demonstrations.”[^16]

King’s answer is a tacit warning—do not mistake style, in this case Albert Boutwell’s more moderate style, for substance—that just as well applied to King. Putting aside the matter of manners, King says simply, “They are both segregationists.”

When King recounted the clergy’s query before a black audience after he left the jail, “Why didn’t you give the new administration time to act?,” he repeated the “Letter’s” reasoned distinction between Boutwell and Connor but drew on all his ample powers of mimicry to give it a sarcastic street edge. The first group might be “a little more gentle and more articulate than Mr. Connor”—here King playing Boutwell enunciated precisely and said with an almost jaunty, genteel lilt, “and I am a segregationist”—whereas “Bull Connor says”—here King rushed the words together in a menacing growl (“I’m-a-segregationist”)—before adding, “but it means the same thing.”[^17]

King’s skepticism about Boutwell’s gentleness is a prelude to his analysis of the forces that drive social change. There are echoes here of that unsentimental insurgent we encountered in the mass meetings who urged his audience to “buy black” and asked neighbors to shame and scorn those who violated the movement. Given the popular dreamy image of King, it is worth mulling this sharp assertion in the “Letter”: “We have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is a historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily.” King supports this historical observation with venerable theological authority, citing the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr’s view that “groups are more immoral than individuals.” All this constitutes a tacit rebuke of the national conviction of the ordained nature of American freedom spread by gradual progress. “We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.” The evil that is segregation will not be dissipated simply by high-flown appeals to a white majority.

The primal character of “painful experience” nudges King out of his abstract generalities and gives him a different kind of authority. His very next word, “frankly,” portends the truth telling to follow and may explain the passive-aggressive dig that finishes. “I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was ‘well timed’ in the view of”—here King has a rather euphemistic way of saying “white people”—“those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation.” _It’s a black thing; you wouldn’t understand._

With this shot at clueless bystanders—at clueless whites—things get even more personal and barbed as King returns to the matter of waiting. “For years now I have heard the word ‘Wait!’ It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ‘Wait!’ has almost always meant ‘Never.’ As one of our distinguished jurists said, ‘Justice too long delayed is justice denied.’”

After laboring so hard to project an air of equanimity, despite those radiant stars of brotherhood that will come at the end of the “Letter,” King now aligns himself with a different sort of brotherhood. He embraces “every Negro” and the race’s impatience. “Wait!” rings in his ear too.

Given that the clergy, the _New York Times_, and the Kennedy administration all have told King to wait, he has essentially called them liars too. They say “wait,” but they really mean “never.” This verdict on white mendacity closes some of the distance between King and the Nation of Islam, which saw itself as trying “to help the poor Negroes quit being duped and deceived by the ‘tricknology’ of the ‘blue-eyed devil white man.’”[^18]

It is also clear that King is not talking about a small number of Caucasians. He repeats his previous dig, and the aggressiveness seems not so much passive as oblique. “Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say ‘Wait.’” The clergymen, and those for whom they are merely stand-ins, are smug bystanders: They take the easy way and not the moral path; they can’t empathize with strangers, can’t identify with all God’s children, can’t imagine the piercing and ringing that black people suffer. Who are the people who have not “felt the stinging darts of segregation”? We are back to white people. It is the second time that King has repeated this formulation of quasi-racial determinism. It is their whiteness that precludes whites from grasping certain truths.

All this solidarity with every fed-up Negro foreshadows the most dramatic portion in all of the “Letter.” Right after King observes, “Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, ‘Wait,’” the poised emblem of brotherhood speaks from the heart as a black man who suffers all the stings and slights of his race. Because the passage is so important—it is a single gargantuan sentence driven by the repetition of “when you” and the passions touched off by the sensuous acts of seeing and finding—it’s worth quoting in its entirety:

But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters with impunity; when you see the vast majority of your 20 million Negro brothers smothering in an air-tight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her own little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by unconsciously developing a bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son asking: “Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?”; when you take a cross-country drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading “white” and “colored”; when your first name becomes “nigger,” your middle name becomes “boy” (however old you are) and your last name becomes “John,” and your wife and mother are never given the respected title “Mrs.”; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of “nobodiness” …

Throughout the recitation of black affliction, King seems like a man on fire. He has left behind the appeals to reason. The poise and patience have vanished in a flood of emotion. He no longer downplays his blackness. Recall his furious state of mind when he began writing; keep in mind that this venture into the recesses of black life and psyche was triggered by his resentment at being told to wait. How could he not burn as he chronicles the denigration and killing of his “black brothers and sisters”?

There is an even riskier part to King’s confessional. He is laying bare not just anger but the inner wounds of being a Negro: humiliation, standing on tiptoes, the sense of nobodyness. King has often played the role of assuaging the hurt of blacks. While preaching, he often presented himself as a healer of the race, offering balm for deep wounds. In one sermon, he assumed the role of “the old slave preacher [who] would look at his people, he would say to ’em, … ‘all week long you’ve been called a nigger. But I wanna say to you, You ain’t no slave, you ain’t no nigger, but you God’s chillun.’”[^19] But here he reveals those wounds to the whites he has portrayed as morally clueless and deficient in empathy.

King is not simply reporting the hurt and anger of the race; the anger and the hurt are his own. Despite his relatively privileged background as the son of an esteemed preacher, he has been harried and humiliated, has walked on tiptoes. When as a young boy he was denied a seat on a segregated bus and called a nigger, he proclaimed his hatred for whites, a feeling that lingered for years. After a white playmate’s father cut off their contact as they grew older, he was inconsolable. His heart, he said, had been broken. Sitting on his mother’s lap, he wanted to know, “Why don’t white people like us, Mother dear?” His first time in a predominantly white institution, Crozier Theological Seminary, he was so afflicted with self-consciousness that he was too embarrassed to eat watermelon or laugh heartily lest he fortify white stereotypes.[^20]

For all the often cool dignity of King’s persona, these hot passions always simmered close to the surface. A glimpse of Malcolm X on television could call forth a twinge of his old hatred of whites. When King told a church audience after the Watts riots, “I know the temptation to become bitter,” and then added, “which comes to all of us. We’ve been trampled over so long,” he was declaring his empathy not just for their bitterness but for his own. Although he rejected the violence of the Watts rioters in 1965, he situated “my black brothers and sisters” in the exonerating context of their “understandable outrage” and placed himself inside that same community.[^21]

At a certain point in the “Letter,” this metaphoric family of black brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers transfigures into King’s actual family. His father, Daddy King, had witnessed a lynching as a boy and pledged to his mother: “I’d carry a hatred in me for white people until the day I died. I would hate every one of them and fight them day and night, trying to destroy any of them I had a chance to.” King watched white policemen and store owners denigrate his father. The six-year-old girl who couldn’t go to Funtown was his own daughter, Yolanda.

As compressed as these references were, King did not usually let white people see his vulnerability. He did not even let black people see him this vulnerable except occasionally while preaching. One gets an even better sense of the depth of this wound from a recording of the story of Funtown that King told a few years later at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Los Angeles. King was speaking there not as the grand leader of the race but as an ordinary black parent. Fleshing out the story dramatically, he perfectly captured the relentless insistence and singsong rhythm of a little girl who came bounding down the stairs and said, “Daddy, you know I been telling you, I want to go to Funtown, and they were just talking about Funtown on the television and I want you to take me to Funtown.”

We can actually hear the quaver in his voice as the great orator recounted, “and, ohhh, I stood there speechless. How could I explain to a little six-year-old girl that she couldn’t go to Funtown because she was colored?” King gave Yolanda a rough account of segregation. “But then I looked down into her eyes, and I said to her at that point, and I saw tears form in her eyes. I said, ‘Yokie, don’t allow anyone to make you feel you’re less than them.’”[^22]

Could one say that the “Letter’s” sudden slide into a black perspective was a flight from brotherhood? It is better to see it as a fleeting way to achieve it. King had given whites entrée to the intimate recesses of black life and even of his own. Inviting them to trade places for a moment, he had let them feel what life was like on the other side of the Jim Crow border. The invitation was generous in a second way. King was gambling that whites might respond to the pathos of black suffering in ways they had not to moral arguments or pragmatic reasons. After proclaiming as a virtual destiny that the oppressor could not possibly understand or empathize with the oppressed, King was offering white oppressors a second chance; they might be clueless but not hopeless. Maybe interracial understanding was possible after all. Maybe they could respond to the cry for justice if they could first _feel_ the injustice.

As King heads toward the resolution of that heaping sentence, the refrain of “when you … when you … when you” is finally ready to find completion. King pulls himself out of the torrent of black emotion, abandons the black “you,” and turns back to the _you_ of his white critics: “Then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into an abyss of injustice where they experience the bleakness of corroding despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.”

[Everything the Nazis did was Legal](contents.html#ch02lev1sec3)

When King let whites deep into the black experience, he was expressing the most primal tenets of his faith, the all-encompassing quality of God’s love, his belief that in Christ there is no black or white. The idea of trading places rests on the premise that the things that divide human beings ultimately are accidental and inconsequential to our humanity. We all have the capacity to enter into the experience of others, no matter how different.

From movies like _Trading Places_ to the now fading phenomenon of the “wigger” (for “white nigger,” the white aficionado of hip-hop), from the prevalence of religious switching to the infinite identity mixes of the second generation of immigrants’ children, fluid notions of self have been a signature of American cultural life. King was drawn to such leaps into other people’s identities. A wicked tease, he dispensed a disconcerting mimicry, especially late at night after movement business was done and he and his preacher friends yielded to rowdiness. Rather more earnestly while preaching, King created little stories of borrowing and acquiring identities that served as parables of our universal humanity. He once told about the time he was introduced in the Indian state of Kerala as “a fellow untouchable from the United States of America.” At first, this “peeved” him, but then he started thinking about all the humiliations of segregation and about the “twenty million of my brothers and sisters … still smoldering in an airtight cage of poverty,” and he reversed course: “Yes, I am an untouchable, and every Negro in the United States of America is an untouchable.”[^23]

In another sermon, the identity migrated from Indian to black. Even if Gandhi was, in Jesus’ terms, “not of my fold,” said King, his exemplary acts made him one of the great Christians of the twentieth century. Did he not walk in the way of love? As King kept preaching, his Gandhi began to pick up the Afro-Baptist cadence and even the cry of the mass meeting: “Just keep moving.” “And Gandhi said to his people, ‘If you are hit, don’t hit back; even if they shoot at you, don’t shoot back; if they curse you, don’t curse back, but just keep moving. Some of us might have to die before we get there; some of us might be thrown in jail before we get there, but let us just keep moving.”[^24]

This same entrée into the experience of others continues in the next phase of the “Letter” on the more rarefied plane of theology. As King leaves behind the revelations of hurt and the flashes of fury, he seems in need of respite, the solace of abstraction, after all the emotion he has unleashed on himself and his audience.

“Then you will understand why we find it so hard to wait” prefigures King’s return to patient engagement. As he moves on to another of the clergy’s criticisms, he says earnestly, “You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws.” Putting himself in the shoes of the clergy critics, King concedes: “This is certainly a legitimate concern.” Despite the later association of the “Letter from Birmingham Jail” with Thoreau’s “Civil Disobedience,” this is the only one of six sections of the “Letter” in which King explicitly provides moral justification for such acts of lawbreaking as distinct from acts of protest in general.

King admits up front that reasonable people might see a contradiction in his position: “Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court’s decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: ‘How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?’” In the sermon “Paul’s Letter to American Christians,” did not King have the apostle express shock that “there are some brothers among you who have risen up in open defiance [of _Brown v. Board of Education_]?” This “paradox” was precisely what incensed Robert Kennedy when King was thinking of violating a federal injunction against protests in Albany.

In the “Letter,” King responds to the clergymen’s “anxiety” with care rather than shouting. The theological sophisticate offers axioms, follows the logic of syllogism where it takes him, parses distinctions. “There are two types of laws,” King instructs: “just and unjust.” Ever the teacher, he asks, “How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust?”

After he defines a just law as one “that squares with … the law of God,” King’s impulse is to meet his critics on the terrain of their faith and denomination. He has been doing this for a decade, following the path of mentors like Benjamin Mays, Howard Thurman, and Gardner Taylor into ecumenical dialogue with white liberal Protestantism. He has been doing the same thing on the Jewish front long enough to have his sea legs down in synagogues, invoking Exodus and going light on Jesus without much thinking about it at this point.

King covers all his religious bases in the “Letter.” He glides in and out of the varieties of universalism. One moment he seizes on Catholic authority; the next he jumps to a Jewish source; he riffs on Protestant rationales. In each case, he starts with an irrefutable premise, then draws out its subversive logic. “To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas,” explains King, “any law that uplifts the human personality is just,” and then he pivots: “All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality.” Lest the lone rabbi among the eight clergy critics feel left out, King takes the liberty of slipping the word “segregation” into the mouth of a Jewish sage, as if he were the one condemning it. “Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an ‘I-it’ relationship for an ‘I-thou’ relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is sinful.” Shifting religious communities, King reaches for a Protestant aphorism: “Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man’s tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness?”[^25]

Throughout this paragraph, King is not just logical and high-minded but pliable. The very effort to construct his argument using authorities that would resonate with his critics is a form of deference. And yet there may be a bit of old-fashioned street edge in this solicitousness. Aside from the matter of whether he is a bit of a showoff with all these fancy references, King is subtly applying pressure on them, by deriving his arguments from their authorities. _If you truly believe X, then Y must be true_. As logical as this seems, it also implies a moral judgment: What kinds of ministers or rabbis would tolerate laws that degrade human personality, distort the soul, relegate people to the status of things, and separate people from one another? Either they are hypocrites or they are not too swift. The other part of this subtext is subversive in the context of the time and the place: the confident black man schooling the white men in the tenets of their own faith.

King retains his professor’s voice as he brings things down a notch to a more specific example of just and unjust laws. The latter is a code that a majority compels a minority to obey but doesn’t itself, or a law that the minority has no part in enacting. “Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that state’s segregation laws was democratically elected?” A law can also be just on its face, but not in its application, as when Bull Connor deployed the fire department to invade Fred Shuttlesworth’s Bethel Baptist Church, using the pretext that the fire code may have been violated as a tool of intimidation.

Although King is not quite done with this effort to justify civil disobedience, he stops a moment to bring partial closure to this part of his argument with the most courteous “I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out.” The seeming eagerness for approval continues as King says reassuringly, “In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so _openly, lovingly_, and with a willingness to accept the penalty.”

There is a deeper reassurance at work here than upholding a principle; King is once again assuaging the moderates’ anxiety about the kind of person he, his colleagues, and perhaps black people are. He has exhibited an eclectic range of virtues: He is high–minded, reflective, and earnest. He and the movement are the opposite of primitive, vengeful, and reckless. They are neither rabid nor prone to anarchy. _Did you think we were flaunting our disregard for the law? Did you really think we fomented “anarchy”? On the contrary, we have the highest respect for the law. That’s why we take responsibility for breaking it and do so lovingly_.

There may even have been a subtle boast here lurking in the subtext, which turns back on the clergymen: They cannot tell rabid maniacs from loving Christians. Just think about this concretely. In Birmingham, the lawbreakers cut off the testicles of a black man; they bomb ordinary families; they deploy the burning cross and the whip. Bull Connor, the chief lawman, colluded with the Klan so they could carry out bloody mayhem on Freedom Riders. He even dispatched two of his undercover detectives to meet with a racist and anti-Semitic extremist to arrange the bombing of Fred Shuttlesworth’s church and perhaps the murder of Shuttlesworth himself. And that’s just for starters.

Compare those whites with King, Shuttlesworth, and the rest of the black insurgents whom the clergymen also declare to be extremists and threats to “law and order.” They walk in love and run workshops in which they inoculate activists against vengeance. In their mass meetings, they remind one another that Bull Connor is a child of God. They constantly urge their followers to love the white man. They lean over backward to forestall violence, even to the point of collecting not just real weapons but penknives before protests.

There is a clue that this failure to distinguish infuriates King, a passage in the May version of the “Letter” published by the Quakers that was subsequently deleted. Right after King wrote, “One who breaks an unjust law must do so _openly, lovingly_,” he included these parentheses: (“not hatefully as the white mothers did in New Orleans when they were seen on television screaming, ‘nigger, nigger, nigger’”).[^26] “Nigger” seems out of place in the “Letter,” an intrusion of rawness, a disturber of the genteel sensibility King has been cultivating. It’s not the word itself. When he and his colleagues were in down-home mode, they threw around the terms “nigger” and “cracker.” King sometimes called Andrew Young “lil nigger,” a term of diminutive affection. He will even mimic the high and mighty mandarins of Birmingham as they declaim against “these niggers.” We can’t know what this editorial excision means, but it is possible that King, once he had calmed down a bit from the jail experience, thought better of including it, as if the raw anger he had stuffed inside the parentheses had threatened to come spilling out into the reasonable portrait he was trying to craft.

As King closes out this phase of the “Letter,” he maintains his deferential stance by piling irrefutable source on irresistible example. His conservatism is obvious in his respect for precedent (“Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience”). He points out that he is in the finest of company: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to bow to Nebuchadnezzar “on the ground that a higher law was at stake.” The early Christians “were willing to face hungry lions rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire.” Socrates carried out civil disobedience to preserve academic freedom. And the tea party people, the original Boston ones, dumped their tea in the name of freedom.

A more contemporary set of precedents validates the tradition of civil disobedience, and they involve the most diabolical purveyors of evil known to American culture at the time: Nazis and Communists. The empathy that suffuses King’s examples contains an implicit invitation—really a reciprocal obligation—for others to show in return the same sympathy for the black struggle. Pointing out that “everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary [to oppose Communist oppression] was ‘illegal,’” King says, “If today I lived in a communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country’s antireligious laws.”

As if aligning the civil rights movement with Christians persecuted by Communists were not pointed enough, King also reminds his critics that “every thing Adolf Hitler did in Germany was ‘legal.’” Conversely, “[i]t was ‘illegal’ to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler’s Germany.” Trading places with a good German, King insists, “I am sure that had I lived in Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers.”

This is a simplified version of the more intricate “Jew Face” King performed before the American Jewish Committee, when he imagined German Protestants and Catholics in Nazi Germany masquerading as Jews and donning “the stigmatizing yellow armbands” and thereby making “the oppression of the Jews their very own oppression.”[^27] Once again, King is creating imaginary vignettes of ethical action that resonate perfectly with the Good Samaritan and Dives and Lazarus. The lessons from all those sacred and secular stories are the same: You come to the aid of those who suffer; you acknowledge the humanity of every man and woman. In its universalism and evangelistic reach, the gospel of freedom mirrors the gospel of Jesus Christ with which it is allied.

As we prepare to close out the chronicle of our encounters with King the diplomat, it helps to stand back and take the measure of the man who has revealed himself in the first half of the “Letter.” He is alternatively gracious, logical, high-flown, patient, reasonable, generous, dignified, and forgiving. Clearly, he is a virtuoso of the rites and rituals of decorum. That doesn’t mean he is a saint who has conquered every “unchristian” impulse. He can be furious. He is not above sticking it to his critics with a passive-aggressive jab. At times, his manners seem disingenuous, maybe even manipulative. He can be patronizing, and pedantic too. He is a bit of a showoff. Now and then, he appears to be somewhat boastful, verging on the grandiose: He is awfully certain what he would do if he lived in Nazi Germany; he thinks he is like Amos and the apostle Paul.

And yet the very presence of those impulses only amplifies the impression of King’s admirable restraint. Maybe he vents all the anger and humiliation of being a black man in segregated America, but he quickly recovers his poise. This is the same charged polarity of passion and control that he displayed in _Stride Toward Freedom_, his first book chronicling the Montgomery bus boycott. Despite his message of blessing those who despise you in his impromptu “Sermon on the Porch,” later that night, when he could not sleep, an unseemly thought went through his mind: “I began to think of the viciousness of people who would bomb my home. I could feel the anger rising when I realized that my wife and baby could have been killed … I was once more on the verge of corroding hatred.” But “once more I caught myself and said: ‘You must not allow yourself to become bitter.’”[^28]

This creative channeling of impulse rather than repressing it was central to King’s worldview, his theology, and his personality. That is precisely the twist King gave to his urging blacks “to love the white man” and the effort he made to distinguish that love from liking the white man. It is the same restraint involved in blessing those who curse you. It is the restraint he fights to achieve when he hints at his own personal struggle with erotic demons. It is precisely what Young is after when he describes the nonviolent approach as “not emotional, although it is deeply spiritual. It is a rational process that seeks to transform, rather than defeat, the oppressor and the oppressive situation.” He adds, “Any kind of emotional outburst—violence, arrogance, intentional martyrdom—endangers the process of transformation. Emotionalism confirms the prejudices of those that nonviolence aims to transform.”[^29]

Tellingly, King was drawn to the psychoanalytical notion of sublimation. While preaching at Dexter Baptist Church, he even went on at some length about it. “But all of the psychologists tell us that it’s dangerous to repress our emotions, that we must always keep them on the forefront of consciousness. And we must do something else—not repress but sublimate. That’s another big psychological word that we use in the modern world: sublimation. But religion gives you the art of sublimation, and so you don’t repress your emotions, you substitute the positive for the negative of repression … and that is what religion gives us when we go unto Christ.”[^30]

If King may yet still emerge as a zealous prophet, so far he has been no prisoner of his zeal. Quite the opposite. In every one of his guises so far, King transcended his own ethnicity and indignation, entered the imaginative world of every person, religion, or culture, and affirmed the values of dignity that he hoped would prevail in the larger society. Thus did King honor his critics with the simple fact of his willingness to engage them, the patience with which he outlined distinctions, and the prolonged nature of his step-by-step refutations. There was flattery in the implicit premise of all this expenditure of time and energy: His listeners possessed the capacity to be moved by moral appeal and rational argument.

Such diplomacy has a special resonance in the historical context of slavery and segregation. Like the dominated everywhere, blacks learned the folly of brashness, the danger of violating the etiquette of racial deference, and the virtues of veiling one’s true feelings. That is why the mass meetings often staged cathartic rituals to free their audiences from fear and let them experience the vicarious joys of talking back to local pharaohs (“I’m gonna tell George Wallace …”). In his 1964 book on the Birmingham campaign, _Why We Can’t Wait_, King deflated the white illusion that blacks were satisfied: Blacks defended themselves “by perfecting an air of ignorance and agreement. In days gone by, no cook would have dared to tell her employer what he ought to know.”[^31]

Yet King’s diplomacy had other sources. It also flowed from his own gracious temperament. And as a son of privilege and an elite “Morehouse Man,” he had been imbued with the ideals of dignity and refinement the black elite adopted as a rebuff to racist stereotypes of black primitivism. Moreover, as the “Sermon on the Porch” made clear, “manners” made utter theological sense too—Jesus said bless those who curse you, don’t curse them back—and that is why King ended up affirming the same lessons of love and nonviolence in the poolrooms and churches of black Birmingham.

The final source of King’s disposition toward sublimation was pragmatic. After all, he wanted to win people over to his side, wanted them to grasp the fierce urgency of now and support the movement. It is why back in 1954 King parted company with Ralph Abernathy over who should lead the Montgomery bus boycott. This was before King was dragooned into that role. Abernathy’s choice was E. D. Nixon, the venerable activist, whom Abernathy described as “a huge man with almost blue-black skin.” He was authoritative and militant and would sweat “prodigiously as he waved his arms or pounded the table.” But “Martin … objected to the fact that Nixon was uneducated and used poor grammar. He felt [Rufus] Lewis, an imposing brown-skinned man who was also polished in speech, could command more respect from the white community.”[^32]

That King’s solicitousness was practical did not mean others could practice it. Such grace could seem a bit naive, even masochistic. From the parochial vantage point of today, was it not absurd to have to explain to educated, moderate men of God who claimed to believe in democracy that blacks were entitled to their claims to rights and humanity now? To return to that question that lingered at the close of chapter one, why engage them at all?

Moreover, to increasing numbers of blacks in the 1960s, all the gingerly stepping seemed unmanly, akin to the “living constantly at tiptoe stance” that King had described as a painful affliction. The scorn for such vigilance was most disdainfully articulated by the Freedom Riders, by the young student militants, and by the burgeoning legions of black nationalists. As Stokely Carmichael, the ever more militant SNCC leader, put it in 1966, “For once, black people are going to use the words they want to use—not just the words whites want to hear.”[^33] It wasn’t only Malcolm X and his “angry children,” as Julius Lester deemed them, who decried Uncle Toms. Fred Shuttlesworth did also.

For all the deferential style in the first half of the “Letter,” we have also encountered more than a few hints of the less than decorous substance: the hard-boiled pronouncements about oppressors and oppressed; the streetwise recognition of the debilitating effects of whiteness on whites; the power of King’s solidarity with “every Negro”; the devastating judgment levied on whites by the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr’s maxim “Groups tend to be more immoral than individuals”; the insolence of the black man lecturing white Southern clergy; and the fact that King’s so-called deference was often so decorative and stylized that it virtually flaunted its superficiality. In the second half of the “Letter,” King will put aside much of that caution. The diplomat will yield to the prophet.

As we prepare to delve deep into this drama, it is good to recall King’s own warning not to mistake style for substance when he was mocking the idea of a difference between Bull Connor and Albert Boutwell. Reverend Joseph Lowery—a later president of SCLC who brought to the Montgomery bus boycott not only his own experience with running a bus boycott in Mobile, Alabama, but a sack filled with hundreds of dollars of offerings—made a distinction that is key to making sense of what King was up to in the “Letter”: His spirit was kindly, but his message was irretrievably tough. He was, in fact, a tender prophet. King himself may have put it best. “But I still will feel as Jesus said to his disciples, as sheep amid wolves, be ye as strong and as tough as a serpent and as tender as a dove. And we will be able to do something that will give new meaning to our own lives and I hope to the life of the nation.”[^34]

### Prophet]]

[I Am an Extremist](contents.html#ch03lev1sec1)

At roughly the midpoint of the “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” almost out of the blue, Martin Luther King, Jr., says, “I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers.”

That seems inoffensive enough, and utterly in accord with the spirit of the first half of the “Letter.” King still honors his “brothers.” The act of confession implies intimacy. The “must”—and it will surface throughout the second half—evokes the involuntary nature of the deed. Right before he spells out the particulars of one of his disappointments, he softens the blow with a qualifying “almost” and the language of “regret,” as if to say, “I’m not the sort of guy who is aching to go where I am about to.”

We should not let these typical King feints distract us. This disclosure signals the passionate truth telling that lies ahead. It inaugurates a turning point in the “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” King drops much of the indirection and politesse in favor of blunt talking. The other-directed man who has been so solicitous of the feelings of his white critics recedes. He is mainly finished with explaining himself to his white critics. He is now ready to reprimand them.

It’s not that we are meeting King anew. We have had hints before of this indignant, even aggressive black man lurking in the shadows. But until now they have mainly surfaced as minor notes, an oblique intimation here or an inadvertent lapse there, but restrained by King’s concern to persuade his audience. Maybe at the outset King equated himself to the eighth-century prophets, but he did not sound like a self-righteous scold. But recall our initial warning: Sometimes the prophet does not seem like a prophet when he first arrives in town.

From here on out, the prophet reveals himself (although he never entirely loses his idiosyncratic appearance). What, then, does he reveal? Most obviously, that he is not afraid to let his white critics have it. That for all his exquisite manners, he is willing to match a tough-and-rude message with a rough-and-tumble style. But ultimately, what matters here is less the man revealed than the startling things the man believes: his jaundiced view of American exceptionalism; the force of his indictment not of a handful of clergymen but of the moral core of American culture itself; and a deep faith in black self-sufficiency.

Before we examine the details of King’s disclosures, it is worth briefly mulling the ambiguity of the emotion that drives the second half of the “Letter.” When King says he is disappointed, that could be just a decorous way of saying, “I’m really mad at you.” So it is not crazy to wonder if maybe King is still caught up in his old game of treading softly and not saying precisely what he means. Or maybe the euphemism of “disappointment” is so transparent that King is conveying precisely what he means.

Disappointment is not without furies of its own. It is an emotion of dashed expectations. You first have to expect something from someone before he can let you down. At least initially, then, it honors the one who disappoints. But the betrayal in the “Letter” is distinct. After all, a meal or a concert that fails to live up to its advance notice can disappoint, but King’s anticipation has a moral character. It is the gap between the hope that the clergymen would act justly and the fact of their feeble deeds that heightens the intensity of the moral judgment. As a result, such disappointment is infused with indignation, a moral emotion that is driven by a sense that justice has been violated.

With this revelation—“I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate”—King begins the first of two devastating attacks that constitute almost all of the remainder of the “Letter.” Mainly done with defending himself, King goes on the offense and adopts the stance of prosecutor, just one of the forms the prophet assumes in the second half of the “Letter.”

Right off the bat, King attacks the self-regard of the moderates who presumably feel superior to the cracker primitives. You might think the real enemies of black progress are the racial sadists who castrated Edward Aaron or the maniacs who were unhinged by Nat King Cole’s appearance before a white audience. But, King says, “I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner” but the moderate. And not just any old moderate but the “white moderate.” In Christ there may be no divisions of race; in moderation, there clearly is.

What follows is a catalog of the moderates’ failures. This is essentially a refined man’s version of the dozens, that black folk ritual of insult, that King will deploy in various guises until the end of the “Letter.” Done with saving his critics’ faces, he is now ready to slap them. It isn’t a pretty picture. The moderate is “more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice.” His notion of peace is not the presence of righteousness but the absence of tension. He “paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom.” He pats himself on the back by parading his agreement with the goals of civil rights but always objects to the means of realizing them. He is softheaded; he lives by a mythical concept of time and—we are back to the charged issue of patience—always says, “Wait for a more convenient season.” He suffers from “shallow understanding.”

King had been practicing a larger kind of social criticism earlier in the “Letter,” but here he explicitly dispenses with the fiction that he is responding to the eight Birmingham clergymen. Anyone who has ever said “wait” or tried to set the schedule for another man’s freedom belongs to that larger tribe of white moderates. That means not just the Kennedy administration, which had more power than anyone to “set the timetable for another man’s freedom,” or the national media, which had been criticizing King, but the vast majority of Americans who seemed indifferent to black affliction.

If membership in that moderate club is mammoth and diverse, so are the particulars of King’s withering indictment of them, and he still is not done with itemizing the offenses. He now comes to one of the most galling, which sends him racing back to the clergymen’s statement. “You assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence.” King has no problem admitting that there is a martial aspect to his effort. He is engaged in warfare; he presides over an army on the move. The Birmingham mass meetings are full of shout-outs to “warriors” and “freedom fighters.” But King’s army is the church militant. As he will put it in _Why We Can’t Wait_, “It was an army that would move, but not maul. It was an army that would sing but not slay. It was an army that would flank but not falter. It was an army to storm the bastions of hatred, to lay siege to the fortresses of segregation … It was an army whose allegiance was to God.”[^1]

In responding to the accusation that he provokes violence, King starts out on a logical note, virtually a philosopher’s rumination on cause. Isn’t that like condemning the robbed man because his money enticed the robber? Maybe it’s like blaming Socrates because his commitment to truth made the crowd force him to drink hemlock. King is building to one final analogy, and this one prefigures the emergence of Jesus (already a major figure in the symbolism of the Birmingham spectacle) throughout the second half of the “Letter.” “Isn’t this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never-ceasing devotion to God’s will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion?”

King has executed some pretty mean juijitsu here. If King is Jesus, his critics are akin to Christ killers, or at least apologists for them. And if King is implementing “God’s will,” how do we characterize the movement’s opponents?

King now returns to one of the failings he briefly alluded to moments before: the mythic view of time that moderates use to rationalize their lack of a sense of moral urgency about black freedom. King quotes a letter a “white brother” has sent him from Texas: “All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost 2,000 years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.” This is a variant of that white suggestion to slow down and pray that provoked the portion of King’s March sermon, when he reminded the Ebenezer congregation of God’s command to the Israelites “to go forward.” It arouses all the barely contained fury provoked previously by “Why didn’t you wait?” and perfectly contained in King’s equation: Wait equals never.

King first lambastes that idea of time in secular terms as “a tragic misconception”: “the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will.” Right after this last musing, the first inkling of explicit prophetic chastisement intrudes on this meditation. “We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people.”

_Repent!_ That word of the prophet. Injustice is not just doing bad things; it also includes failing to do good things and not acting to stop bad things. Silence speaks loudly; refraining from action is a form of choice. In both these cases, we bear responsibility, and one must atone. The gospel of freedom does not permit people to just sit on the sidelines and pretend they are immune from responsibility. Such a fiction is bad faith. That was precisely what King was saying in the mass meetings to those blacks he accused of being “unfit to be free.” Human progress is not inevitable but “comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be coworkers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.”

Only after he has established the power of human action is King ready to make his move from the call for repentance to his mass meeting refrain, executed with preacherly rhythm and the hint of an anticipated climax. “We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always right to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.”

As King moves through his diagnosis of the folkways of the moderates, he finally arrives at the clerics’ claim that he is an extremist. At first glance, King appears to backslide to the defensive stance of the first half of the “Letter.” He also seems to succumb to an unseemly bit of caring about what white people think, the same thing that puzzled so many of his SCLC colleagues when he fixated on answering the white clergymen. King admits straight out that their disapproval has stung him. “At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist.”

When you listen to a recording of King preaching about this to a black audience after getting out of jail, you can hear the hurt in his voice, which prompted this almost offhand moment of audacity, the trace of distance, and perhaps disdain, that King emitted when he demoted the critics from their exalted status of “My Dear Fellow Clergymen.” “This really bothered me when I read these preachers were calling me an extremist.” _These preachers!_ And why shouldn’t it bother him? Like outside agitator, “extremist” was one of those words deep in the Southern collective psyche, and the national consciousness too. It suggested the agitators were beyond the pale, even demonically evil.

To refute this charge in the “Letter,” King ascends once more to the high neutral ground as an interpreter for whites, who straddles the boundary and explains to outsiders the meaning of life on the inside. On the one side, instructs King, are blacks who have been so “drained of self respect and a sense of ‘somebodiness’ that they have adjusted to segregation,” plus the small sliver of privileged Negroes who have become “insensitive to the problems of the masses.” The other force is one of “bitterness and hatred” like the Black Muslims, “who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible ‘devil.’ I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate neither the ‘do nothingism’ of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle.”

King has carried out a splendid move of triangulation, resituating himself and his movement squarely in the moderate middle on the spectrum of black opinion. It is as if he were saying, “You are mistaken. Honest, I am not really an extremist; I’m a moderate too, like you.”

King’s treatment of the Nation of Islam requires further attention. In one sense, he has gone to great lengths to separate himself from black nationalism. His warning of the danger of black anger and the recourse to violence is portentous. Before the Birmingham campaign concluded, black anger would explode on the streets. Already, back in Albany, that anger had erupted in a night of rioting, which sent King into what he quaintly referred to as “the dives” to assuage the thirst for vengeance. Nobody in King’s circle hewed to the illusion that most blacks, including many of their own supporters, embraced nonviolence as a moral creed, which is why they went into the rougher haunts, the bars and the poolrooms, to ask that element to at least stay on the sidelines.

King is deploying a not-so-subtle blackmail here, squeezing white America in a pincer movement: If you don’t back me up, you could get something worse. If you “refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies,” the consequence of which will be “a frightening racial nightmare.”

Likely because King is exploiting the potential for blackmail in this moderate fear of “worse,” he damps down his usual sympathy for Black Muslims and for black nationalism more generally. As we just saw, when he placed himself inside the fellowship of black rage after the Watts riots, he was full of tender sympathy, emphasizing that he too knew “the temptation to become bitter which comes to all of us.” In his one known meeting with Elijah Muhammad, the head of the Black Muslims, their main disagreement was over the degree of white devilry, not its undeniable reality. King had asked, “‘Do you really believe that _all_ white folks are devils? I know a lot of white people have a lot of devil in them …’ Mr. Muhammad smiled. ‘Dr. King,’ he said, ‘you and me both grew up in Georgia, and we know there are many different kinds of snakes. The rattlesnake was poisonous and the king snake was friendly. But they both snakes, Dr. King.’ And the two of them, the Messenger of Allah and the apostle of Christian love, had a hearty laugh.”[^2]

In the “Letter,” King does not entirely forgo that sympathy. Even as he identifies the followers of the Nation of Islam as “people who have lost faith in America,” hate the white man, and reject Christianity, he explains that all those things are “nourished by the Negro’s frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination.”

This refusal to condemn more militant blacks culminates in the moment when King essentially repeats the blackmail tactic, but this time with a more cerebral twist focusing on the inevitability of his movement. “Oppressed people,” he asserts as an axiom, “cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what happened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something without has reminded him that it can be gained.” The reminding, in part, was the work of a global zeitgeist: The Negro had joined his “black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean” and with them is “moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice.”

This assertion of inevitability—the unquenchable thirst for freedom, the global force of liberation, the impossibility of damming up that impulse—is accompanied by one of the strangest episodes, perhaps the only off note, in all of the “Letter.” It is King’s appeal to white noblesse oblige and the patronizing premise that follows from it, as if black freedom were at the beck and call of white discretion: “So let him march, let him make prayer pilgr_resources/books//Gospel of Freedom_ Martin Luther King, Jr. - Jonathan Rieder to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides—and try and understand why he must do so.”

King fortifies the inevitability of this rising up for freedom with a therapeutic twist as he assumes the role of the race’s psychoanalyst. “The Negro has many pent-up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release them … If his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history.” Invoking “my people” before this white audience, King continues, so “I have not said to my people, ‘Get rid of your discontent.’ Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now this approach is being termed extremist.”

Throughout this portion of the “Letter,” King has remained in that hiatus of restraint he fell into after he blasted the moderates. It does not seem entirely out of kilter with the mood of the first half of the “Letter.” “Try to understand,” he says to the white clergy and the large white audience he is addressing. All the gambits here—the fine-grained portraiture of the black community, the cerebral dynamic of sublimation, his reflection on the global “zeitgeist” of freedom—participate in this reversion to a dialogue of reason. But the withering indictment that precedes this momentary mellowing, the flashes of the prophet’s voice (“we will have to repent”), and the designation of silence as “appalling” prefigure the fiery spirit of the rest of this section and the rest of the “Letter.”

After all the effort King has expended to show he is not really an extremist, he abruptly reverses course and boldly declares his indifference to white judgment. Not only does he embrace the stigma of the extremist label, but he is also perverse enough to admit pleasure in it. “As I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label.” The subtext is clear: I don’t really care about your terminology or your disapproval.

King now lets loose a barrage of questions that are not really questions, but more like fists pummeling his critics into submission. Only he lets unquestionable authorities do the pummeling for him. The boxer is a ventriloquist, speaking the words of his revered icons as if they were his. “Was not Jesus an extremist for love: ‘Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.’ Was not Amos an extremist for justice: ‘Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an everflowing stream.’ Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: ‘I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.’” On and on the questions roll down like waters, and the religious stalwarts are followed by other allies punching back at his critics too: John Bunyan, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln.

If this passage has the feeling less of writing than of preaching, it is not just because of its rhythm and repetition but because it is a replay of a passage, slightly reconfigured, of King’s “Transformed Nonconformist,” another of the sermons he included in _Strength to Love_. The main difference is that instead of “extremist,” King used the word “maladjusted” in the sermon: “We need men today as maladjusted as … ,” and King cited many of the same extremists he lists in the “Letter” as maladjusted, including Amos, Jefferson, and Lincoln. The starting point for the sermon is Paul’s command in Romans “And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.” The homile is a perfect statement of King’s Christian radicalism. “We need to recapture something that the early Christians had. They went out aglow with a radical gospel. They were nonconformists in the truest sense of the word.”[^3]

King’s observation in “Transformed Nonconformist”—“Our Lord and Master Jesus Christ” was nailed on a cross for being a nonconformist—prepares the way for a more personal twist to his own identification with his Savior. “It may mean walking through the valley of the shadow of suffering. It may mean losing a job. It may mean having to answer your six-year-old daughter when she asks, ‘Daddy, why do you have to go to jail so much?’ Well, this is it! But after all, this is what we as Christians are pledged to do.” The lines that immediately follow in the sermon acquire an especially resonant quality in the light of the setting in which King wrote the “Letter.” “We are gravely mistaken if we feel that Christianity is a religion to protect us from the pain and agony of mortal existence. Christianity has always insisted that there is a Good Friday before every Easter, and that the cross we bear always precedes the crown we wear.”[^4]

King had preached that sermon as early as 1954, but the reference to his daughter Yolanda and her age indicates this was one of the passages he added when he polished the draft of _Strength to Love_ in the fall of 1962. The cost of his daughter’s missing her father was not as dramatic as being stalked by death, yet surely it was no less poignant. Andrew Young points to all the familial occasions on which King was in jail, and he notes how long it took for many people in the movement to reconstitute their relationships with their children. That too was part of the sacrificial burden, as Yolanda grasped years later in her reflections on Funtown.

“I don’t remember how Daddy finally explained to me I couldn’t go [to Funtown]. I know that he wrote and spoke about the fact that it was very difficult for him … My father stated that event ‘caused the first dark cloud of inferiority to float over my little mental sky.’ I guess it did.” But there was worse to come. A few years later she was “teased and taunted unmercifully” by her classmates, mainly the children of black professionals, because she had a “jailbird” for a father. Her mother, Coretta, did her best to explain why her father was always away, why he had to go to jail, about racism. Unsurprisingly, Yolanda wondered, with all the innocence of childhood, “What did that have to do with my world and what was happening to me?” Suddenly, her mother had an inspiration. “Mother told me that the reason Daddy had to go to jail was so that I could go to Funtown. That was it! I got that. I thought, _If my daddy is going to jail so I can go to Funtown, well great! He can stay as long as he needs to_. After that, nobody could tell me my daddy was a bad man.” When her father finally did take her to Funtown, it was a media spectacle. Despite the swarm of journalists, Yolanda discovered something powerful. “Funtown wasn’t all that great after all. What was wonderful, and important, was the rare opportunity to spend time with my daddy.”[^5]

The primacy of Jesus in King’s preaching and throughout the symbolism of the Birmingham campaign is evident. In truth, it was Jesus and not Moses with whom King identified. As a child he constantly sang the gospel song “I want to be more and more like Jesus.” It makes sense, then, that in an earlier version of the “Letter” the finale in the repetition of “Amos was an extremist” and “Jefferson was an extremist” returned to “that scene on Calvary’s hill” where “three men were crucified … for the same crime—the crime of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality … The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and goodness … Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.”[^6]

The aggression of King’s pushback appears not only in his defiant embrace of extremism or the zing of his comebacks but also in the ferocious weaponry of unimpeachable sources that brook no disagreement. Maybe the most cutting barb of all is contained in the subtext of King’s righteous superiority, a hint of which we discovered in the last chapter: The moderates cannot even tell prayerful Christians from real extremists like George Wallace or Bull Connor! It is not just that King has the nerve to speak the words of Amos, Jefferson, and Paul as if they are his own; he does not fear presenting himself as the Savior he shares with all his critics save the rabbi. There is no doubt: King is the “extremist for love” on Calvary. He is the one crucified on Good Friday. He is suffering so that others can go free. “So the question is not whether we will be extremists,” says King, “but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love?”

That question seems like a natural resting point, but one more blow of the hammer remains to fall. This is a secular slap at the moral failure of whites, the lead up to which has more than a trace of passive aggression. “I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need [for creative extremism]. Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much.” If that dig does not sting enough, the judgment that is about to fall, an elaboration of the earlier point about the limited moral acuity of white moderates, surely should.

As always, King does not levy his charge at the entire race. Just as he conceded to Elijah Muhammad the devilry of “lots of whites” but maybe not all, the “Letter” recognizes that “some of our white brothers [in the South] have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it.” Some “have marched with us down nameless streets of the South” and gone to jail for freedom and suffered brutality doled out by “policemen who view them as ‘dirty nigger-lovers.’” And some “have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms.”

Although King does not say much about the particulars of that last group, he does name some of them. He places the writer Lillian Smith on the roster of the righteous. Her 1949 book _Killers of the Dream_ portrayed the evil of segregation with a vivid sense of personal immediacy. “The mother who taught me what I know of tenderness and love and compassion taught me also the bleak rituals of keeping Negroes in their ‘place.’” During the Montgomery bus boycott, she wrote King with “a profound sense of fellowship and admiration.” Recognizing the dignity, goodness, and courage of his movement, she wanted him to know that “you have the awe and respect of many southern whites.”[^7]

Harry Golden, the newspaperman and humorist who attacked segregation in his _Carolina Israelite,_ makes King’s list of good Southerners too. He had come up with an ingenious solution for school integration, the Vertical Negro Plan. Given that Southerners were not loath to stand in grocery store lines with Negroes, Golden surmised the real problem was sitting with them, so he advised simply removing all the chairs from Southern schools. Golden had once been asked, “What’s a Jew doing down here trying to change the Southern way of life?” Golden retorted, “I am trying to organize a Jewish society for the preservation of Christian ethics.”[^8]

Least surprisingly, Ralph McGill, the great writer and editor from the _Atlanta Constitution_, is a member in good standing of that tribe of the enlightened. He had made an observation even more precisely related to King’s critique of white moderates: “I have always had a deep sympathy for and understanding of, the ‘wool-hatters,’ the ‘red-necks,’ and the ‘crackers,’ to employ terms in common use describing the illiterate, poor provincial Southerner … True enough, he makes up the mobs. He does the dynamiting. He burns the Negro schools and churches.”[^9]

McGill understood that it was too easy to blame the “red-neck” for something that was entangled utterly in the whole fabric of Southern life. “But let it be said in his behalf that he has done this on every occasion, at the invitation of governors or local leaders, or at the behest of the White Citizens Councils, which by and large are made up of business and professional men many cuts above the red-neck in education, financial security, and position. The Southern red-neck has invariably been used and exploited, and not always in the area of economics.”[^10] These noble figures in no way invalidate King’s more basic estimation: “Big in quality,” the tribe of good Southerners is “all too few in quantity.”

If anything, the sparseness of good whites underlines the extent of the moderates’ failings. This is the point of the devastating sentence that precedes King’s list of noble heroes. For a second time (and a third sentence) in the “Letter,” the icon of universal love flirts with the determinism of race. The oppressors are whites in general, and they are incapacitated by their whiteness: They do not understand black suffering, cannot see what justice requires. “I suppose,” King reflects, “I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action.”

[What Kind of People Worship Here?](contents.html#ch03lev1sec2)

King’s second confession of disappointment shifts from secular targets to the white church, but King continues to draw on his sermon “Transformed Nonconformist.” For both the white church and white moderates, the parallelism is exact: King begins with a revelation of “disappointment” whose bristling feels more like indignation, defines quite specific complaints and grievances, and then moves to a higher prophetic vantage point for dispensing chastisement.

That does not mean that King stops being his own sort of prophet. Even as he admonishes, he never entirely abandons caution in choosing his words. In the interest of fairness, he again acknowledges exceptions to his disappointment. He thanks God for those “noble souls” representing organized religion who have broken loose from “the paralyzing chains of conformity and joined us as active partners in the struggle for freedom … They have gone down the highways of the South on tortuous rides for freedom … Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the gospel in these troubled times.”

King even praises one of the eight clergymen to whom the “Letter” is addressed. He singles out Rev. Earl Stallings for acting like a good Christian. On Easter Sunday, while King was in jail but perhaps before he had read the eight clergymen’s letter, blacks testing their welcome in white churches across Birmingham were denied entry at most of them. At Stallings’s First Baptist Church, however, Andrew Young and four black women entered the church, where they sang “Christ the Lord Is Risen Today.” Although Young’s offering for the collection basket was rejected and dozens of worshippers walked out of the church, Reverend Stallings greeted Young warmly after the service.[^11]

King also stresses that he is not a naysayer who reflexively chides the church. He is “a minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was nurtured in its bosom.” If he has “wept over the laxity of the church,” he has done so only “in deep disappointment” because he expected so much more from the clergymen. He eagerly reassures them that “my tears have been tears of love. There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love.”

None of that warmth overshadows the scolding King is about to dish out. It is a version of the censure he unleashed three months earlier in his address to the Chicago Conference on Race and Religion, but this time with the gloves taken off.

King migrates back to the Montgomery bus boycott, when he anticipated that “the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be among our strongest allies. Instead, some have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been cautious more than courageous and have remained silent and secure behind the anesthetizing security of stained glass windows.” Despite “my shattered dreams,” King tells them, he brought similar high hopes to Birmingham, where those dreams were shattered again. Not only did the white religious leadership fail to cry out for justice, but they did not even see “the justice of our cause.”

One source of King’s disappointment here is theological: ministers who argue that “these are social issues with which the gospel has no real concern.” This view was precisely what the then-segregationist Reverend Jerry Falwell, who became one of the leaders of the Christian right in the 1980s, preached in his 1965 “Ministers and Marches” sermon after the liberal clergy had flocked to Selma, Alabama, in response to King’s call for help. “The Christian’s citizenship is in heaven. Our only purpose on this earth … is to know Christ and to make Him known … Preachers are not called to be politicians but to be soul winners.”[^12] Repeating the argument in the “Letter” that he made to the Birmingham Black Ministerial Alliance, King rejects churches that embrace “a completely otherworldly religion which makes a strange, unbiblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and the secular.”

But the Southern clergy have not just come down on the wrong side in a quarrel over theology. They are guilty of the same failings of caring and character displayed by the moderates. As King tells it, the nation is caught up “in the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro” and “a mighty struggle” to get rid of them. What do these moral leaders do? “I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the _law_? But I have longed to hear white ministers declare, ‘Follow this decree because integration is morally _right_ and because the Negro is your brother.’” Instead, they “stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities.”

These failures of the white church propel King on a spiritual journey through the Deep South. Throughout this trip, an eerie perceptual distance mirrors the remove of the man who is observing it all.

Telling stories about his travels was a staple of King’s preaching. He once regaled a congregation about the time a white woman next to him on a plane told him “how liberal she was,” but added, “I wouldn’t want a Negro to marry my daughter.” Slipping further into a drawl, King cracked the audience up when he shared his riposte: “I wouldn’t want my daughter to marry George Wallace.”[^13]

But the trip that most resembles the one he is about to tell in the “Letter” is the one he used to introduce himself to the American people in _Stride Toward Freedom_. Driving through the South on his way to Dexter Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, he was a cultivated ruminator, listening to the New York Metropolitan Opera perform _Lucia di Lammermoor,_ watching the landscape pass by, and discerning nature and architecture from a serene distance. Ever sensitive to the impression he was making on his white readers, King omitted the fact that the brilliant and wild preacher Vernon Johns accompanied him on the final leg of the trip and that when they got to Ralph Abernathy’s house, there was plenty of down-home carrying on about “white people’s food” and a “big nigra” on the board of Dexter Baptist Church.[^14]

This time the Southern road trip serves to present not King in a positive light but the so-called beloved Southland in a bad light. “I have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi[,] and all the other Southern states. On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at the South’s beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines of her massive religious education buildings. Over and over I have found myself asking: ‘What kind of people worship here? Who is their God?’”

As the “Letter” devolves into a journey into the white Christian soul, the questions “What kind of people worship here?” and “Who is their God?” signal estrangement. It is as if King had fixed his anthropological sights on an alien tribe. It is even possible that “their God” is not the same as King’s. The follow-up questions confirm their judgmental character: “Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where were their voices of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of creative protest?”

The questions so obviously imply their answers that they cannot even be deemed disingenuous. And so: “What kind of people worship here?” And by extension, “What sort of people preach here?” The sort of people who, as King put it just a moment earlier, never called for integration as the expression of their moral faith.

Is that whack fair to the eight clergymen, who had reproached Wallace in January, no matter how gingerly? The question is beside the point. At this moment King is talking to a bigger audience, the white Southern church. But his larger—and more lacerating—criticism applies perfectly to his eight critics. Their Good Friday and January statements mainly affirmed “law and order” against “defiance [of the law], anarchy, and subversion.” They did not condemn segregation; in January, they daintily euphemized it as part of the “cherished patterns of life in our beloved Southland.” They did not ask the people of Alabama to love Negroes because they were their brothers. They did not even express much sympathy for suffering blacks. The closest they came in the Good Friday statement was: “We recognize the natural impatience of people who feel that their hopes are slow in being realized.”

Compare that with Rabbi Heschel’s outrage in Chicago. “To act in the spirit of race is to sunder, to slash, to dismember the flesh of living humanity … _Racism is satanism_, unmitigated evil … Daily we should take account and ask: What have I done today _to alleviate the anguish, to mitigate the evil, to prevent humiliation_.”[^15]

Tellingly, in this portion of the “Letter” King reprises in writing the same sigh he exhaled when he preached in “Paul’s Letter to American Christians”: “Oh, this is blasphemy.” In the “Letter,” he even recognizes the insufficiency of the written word with an exclamation mark: “Yes, I see the church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How we have blemished and scarred that body through social neglect and through fear of being nonconformists.”

What, then, could be done in Birmingham? Or America for that matter? Maybe, King concludes, “organized religion [is] too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world.” It had abandoned the crying out for justice that energized King’s beloved prophets as well as the early Christians who sought “a colony of heaven.”

King had invoked that phrase in the sermon “Transformed Nonconformist” while fleshing out the meaning of the apostle Paul’s command “Be not conformed to the world.” As King put it there, “We as Christians are commanded to live differently. We are called to be people of conviction and not conformity … Every true Christian is a citizen of two worlds: the world of time and the world of eternity. We find ourselves in the paradoxical situation of having to be in the world yet not of the world. As Paul said in another letter: ‘We are a colony of Heaven.’” As King parses the implications of that dwelling, “We are sent out as pioneers to imbue an unchristian world with the ideals and ways of living of a higher order and a more noble realm.”[^16]

In the “Letter,” King offers a vivid portrait of those early Christians. They did not register popular opinion like a thermometer; they were more like “a thermostat that transformed the mores of society.” They ended the ancient evils of infanticide and gladiatorial contests. King doesn’t have to mention his own band of “extremists” to evoke their resemblance to the early zealots. When they entered a town, “the power structure immediately sought to convict them for being ‘disturbers of the peace’ and ‘outside agitators.’ But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction that they were a ‘colony of heaven,’ called to obey God rather than man.”

The contrast with the modern church—a “weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound,” an “archdefender of the status quo”—could not have been more shameful. King admonishes: “The judgment of God is upon the church as never before.” This spiritual abdication carries with it a practical risk, the danger of a mass stampede from a church that has lost its authenticity. Every day, King says, “I meet young people whose disappointment with the church has turned into outright disgust.”

Given King’s penchant for placing his sentiments in the mouths of others, might the “outright disgust” be his own? And given his own vision of the meaning of Christianity, how can he not disdain such spiritual malpractice. In “Guidelines for a Constructive Church,” he preached, “It seems that I can hear the God of the universe … saying, ‘You are a great church because I was hungry and ye fed me. You are a great church because I was naked and ye clothed me’ … And this is the church that’s going to save this world. ‘The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to heal the brokenhearted, to set at liberty them that are captive, and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.’”[^17]

As King makes his way toward the end of the second confession in the “Letter,” he confronts this unsettling possibility: “Perhaps I must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church, the church within the church, as the true ecclesia and the hope of the world.”

Telling someone he is deficient in ecclesia lacks the street edge of casting aspersions on someone’s mother. It doesn’t rise to the intensity of Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s judgment: “God Damn America! That’s in the Bible, for killing innocent people. God Damn America, for treating her citizen as less than human.” It never achieves the drama of King’s warning a few years later: “America too is going to Hell.” It cannot claim the visceral quality of the cry that King utters when he’s devastated by the swollen bodies of hungry black children in Marks, Mississippi: “God doesn’t like this.” Rebuking someone for insufficient ecclesia does not possess the portentous feel of this passage in King’s very first civil rights speech in Montgomery: “The Almighty God himself is not … the God just standing out saying through Hosea, ‘I love you, Israel.’ He’s also the God that stands up before the nations and said: ‘Be still and know that I’m God, that if you don’t obey me I will break the backbone of your power and slap you out of the orbits of your international and national relationships.’ Standing beside love is always justice.”[^18]

All these judgments sound harsher than King’s reluctant abandonment of the outer ecclesia. But the difference involves style more than substance. The constant throughout is the force of the censure, which is why it is hard to separate King’s righteous judgment from the practice of “telling the man” practiced by more radical black critics in the 1960s. King is telling at least some white men about themselves: They cooperate with evil; their silence is complicity in sinful racism; they are spiritual cowards.

[Abused and Scorned Though we May Be](contents.html#ch03lev1sec3)

In bringing down the Lord’s wrath on the white clergy, King had traveled far from his initial “My Dear Fellow Clergymen.” He had transformed a travelogue into a barely disguised prophetic sermon. In the theological terms of Niebuhr that King favored, the God of love had given way to the God of correction. At the same time King was shifting testaments from New to Old, he had lurched from deference to confrontation. There was still one final shift to come: It involved King’s sense of being black, how that shaped his reading of the moral character of Americans, and the whole business of American exceptionalism.

What King has _not_ said provides a good starting place for exploring the end of the “Letter.” Can it be an accident that King has gone so light on the theme of loving the white man? Or that the references to beloved community are so sparse? Or that there are two meager references to American exceptionalism in the entire document? Or that he never ascends the mountaintop and declares, “I have a dream” of black and white children holding hands? A frosty withholding of amity runs through the “Letter.”

It’s not that King ever stopped welcoming and appreciating white allies in the civil rights movement. The mission of reaching out to whites was central to his sense of self. Why else would he write books and give speeches designed to move them? That is why he insisted on answering the eight white clergymen in his feverish state in jail when so many other urgent tasks were pressing on him. After the three white college students from Birmingham—Southern College (the ones Shuttlesworth put his arms around) appeared onstage at a mass meeting, King could not have been more gracious. “These three white students … represent the power of God working in this movement.” Noting that two of them were the children of Methodist ministers, King observed they were doing what they had learned in Sunday school.[^19]

In those years, such witness by whites provoked a deep response from black church audiences. When Rev. C. T. Vivian hugged the activist lawyer William Kunstler in a St. Augustine, Florida, mass meeting in 1964, the audience, many of whom had never seen black and white people in such intimate congress, erupted. As for the movement at large, white reinforcements would soon be on their way. Already, SNCC had its share of white workers, and the blood of white Freedom Riders had stained Southern pavements, not least of all in Birmingham. A trial run for the March on Washington, the first large festival of interracial liberalism in Los Angeles’s Wrigley Field, replete with representatives from Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish clergy as well as Hollywood celebrities, was only one month away. When King shouted out for help in Selma, hundreds of white clergy from every imaginable denomination would flock there to help him.

Throughout April 1963, though, Birmingham blacks remained pretty much on their own. So King’s disappointment could easily have given way to hopelessness. More generally, black nationalism has always tended to wax and wane with the virulence of racism, the responsiveness of the larger white political order to black suffering, and the degree of pessimism that white indifference and callousness inspired. But instead of becoming despondent, right after he had indicted the white church, King struck a note of confident optimism. “But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham.”

How could this be? We know that ultimately King’s hope was grounded in his belief that “the Lord will make a way out of no way,” that the Resurrection follows Crucifixion, that Canaan lies beyond Egypt and the wilderness. Shockingly, in a missive that often has the character of a sermon delivered to fellow clergymen, King holds back his typically lyrical testimonies to his faith in God’s purpose. Is it possible that in his fury he views them as unworthy of such spiritual sharing? In any case, we also know that King does not find comfort in some ordained American destiny of freedom or the moral capacity of white people. One of only two phlegmatic references to American civil religion in the entire letter comes at this point. “We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom.” We know that King has already conceded the ethical limitations of oppressors in general and white oppressors in particular that may preclude moral persuasion: The “oppressor race” cannot empathize with “the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race.”

The truth is that despite his efforts to move whites through intellect and pathos, morality and manners, King never depended on whites for the liberation of his people or the validation of his mission.

At its core, the “Letter” is a proclamation of black self-sufficiency. Perhaps because he was a white Southerner, in his at times problematic account of King in Birmingham, the journalist Reese Cleghorn may have caught this drift that so many others missed. The “Letter” “split him from the white moderates of the South and suggested that Negroes would plot their own course in the future.” It was nothing less than a “declaration of independence in the civil rights crises of the future.”[^20]

In the waning passages of the “Letter,” King emphasizes a different source of his optimism: his profound love of black people and his faith in their moral character, which he long celebrated in black churches and mass meetings. Right after he declares his certainty that blacks will triumph, he begins his paean to black majesty, “Abused and scorned though we may be …” That phrase referred not just to Birmingham blacks or all blacks in America. The phrase comes from the title of an old slave spiritual, “ ’Buked and Scorned,” which evokes both the slaves’ suffering and their conviction that “Jesus died to set me free … Nailed to that cross on Calvary.”

The song was a touchstone for King, an almost mystical link back to the revered slave forebears. Invoking it in a letter to white people, he is aligning himself not just with “every Negro” today but with every Negro through the ages. To intensify that kinship, he waxes lyrical: “Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with America’s destiny. Before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched across the pages of history the mighty words of the Declaration of Independence, we were here.”

The written format of “we were here before” doesn’t begin to capture the assertive force of King’s usual repetition of three of these stanzas. When you hear King preaching this passage, the emphatic beat falls on “we were here,” and it has the ring of irresistible will. It is a fierce declaration of the right to belong, the black claim to membership and humanity that is more primal than, and prior to, all of the civic heroes and revered documents of white history.

In the “Letter,” King immediately segues from “we were here” into another of his favorite passages of ancestor worship: “For more than two centuries our forebears labored in this country without wages; they made cotton king; they built the homes of their masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation.” King here emphasizes not the pathos of suffering victims but the slaves’ exceptional spirituality and fortitude: “And yet out of a bottomless vitality they continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail.”[^21]

This veneration of the slaves reminds us why it is a mistake to place King into the civil religious tradition evoked by his use of the imagery of the American dream. When he reviewed American history, King read it in the light of the black experience of America, in which coerced work was central. The labor of a slave was not the labor of a lonely individual who came to the pristine state of American nature, worked the land and acquired a right to property. Nor was it an errand in the wilderness, the story of Providence watching out and over the unfolding of American glory. The slave’s story was always the story of a people in exile, who “were here” but not allowed to be part of the nation, whose skin color and forced labor made for a different kind of “exceptionalism”: They were other people’s property, the instruments of somebody else’s dream.

“They kept us in slavery 244 years in this country, and they said they freed us from slavery,” King jabbed in a Black Belt meeting in 1968, “but they didn’t give us any land … And they haven’t given us _anything_! After making our foreparents work and labor for 244 years—for nothing! Didn’t pay ’em a cent.” He told the crowd, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, That all men are endowed by their creator with inalienable rights. That’s a beautiful creed,” King said sarcastically. Lest there be any ambiguity, King gibed, “America has never lived up to it … The men who wrote it owned slaves at the same time.”[^22]

That was uttered in a mass meeting in the months before his assassination, but the same bitterness could escape while King was preaching. In “Why Jesus Called a Man a Fool,” King declaimed, “It is the black man who to a large extent produced the wealth of this nation. And the nation doesn’t have sense enough to share its wealth and its power with the very people who made it so.” Suddenly, King’s voice was rising: “And I know what I’m talking about this morning. The black man made America wealthy.”[^23]

You can’t entirely attribute such sentiments to the mood of the late 1960s and King’s growing militancy. In 1963, in a Birmingham mass meeting, King quoted this epitaph by a young Negro soldier during World War ll: “Here lies a black man who died fighting a yellow man for the glory of the white man.” Nor did he shy from telling the story of black exile, albeit in a more exalted fashion, in the rarefied context of _Strength to Love,_ in which he reminded readers: “Our slave foreparents were never unmindful of midnight, for always there was the rawhide whip of the overseer and the auction block where families were torn asunder to remind them of its reality.” King tended to finish such testimonies by consecrating the spiritual stamina of the slaves, their faith in a just and loving God who assured them that “trouble don’t last always.”[^24]

The elegy to the slaves would seem a natural place to end the “Letter.” It would have closed things out with an optimism befitting a preacher whose theology of hope nourished the conviction that God will deliver the captives. Oddly, just when it feels as if King were getting ready to wind things up, he interjects abruptly: “Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in your statement that has troubled me profoundly.” Throughout the second half of the “Letter,” King has often kept the criticism oblique. Save when he praises Rev. Earl Stallings, he has not named names, taking specific people out of the line of fire. The target of “moderates” is elusively general. And “the white church” he observed on his road trip has the ambiguity of an anonymous archetype set in a dreamy, depopulated landscape. But this time King returns explicitly to the eight clergymen’s “Call to Unity” and addresses its authors personally.

Here is what spikes King’s anger: “You warmly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping ‘order’ and ‘preventing violence.’” He immediately shifts from “you commended” to “I doubt that you would have so warmly commended,” leaving open the possibility of a face-saving way out: If only the clergymen had known, of course they wouldn’t have arrived at their ethically wrongheaded conclusions.

That this was a fiction that King didn’t really believe emerges in his biting slide into another of the run-on refrains he resorted to when he was furious. “I doubt that you would have so warmly commended if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were to observe them”—and King finally brings himself in explicitly—“as they did on two occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together.” As a result, “I cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police department.”

Others might have given the clergymen some slack here. Once again, it is possible they were being crafty in their commendation. Maybe they wanted to reinforce both the business community’s support for Laurie Pritchett’s tender tactics and Bull Connor’s surprising willingness to implement them, save for the Palm Sunday lapse with the dogs. The pressure to crack some heads had been rising from segregationists. Governor George Wallace had been champing at the bit to unleash the terrifying Alabama State Police. Not long after King got out of jail, Wallace did just that, with predictably horrifying results.

And yet. _And yet_. The Birmingham police force remained the same force it had always been: teeming with Klan members and sympathizers, led by the man who gladly let the Klan savage the Freedom Riders. This is the force the clergy commended! Earlier in the “Letter,” King has already pointed out that everything Hitler did in Nazi Germany was authorized by law. His slam at incivil obedience is the flip side of his argument about civil disobedience, which he repeats here:

The police have exercised a degree of discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they have conducted themselves rather “nonviolently” in public. But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends … As T. S. Eliot has said: “The last temptation is the greatest treason: To do the right deed for the wrong reason.”

Having moved from “you commended” to “I don’t think you would have commended,” King is ready for the final move: “I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation … One day the South will recognize its real heroes.” There is no timidity or euphemism in the indirection of “I wish you had commended.” King is really saying, “Shame on you, shame on you! You should have commended those Christ-like, noble insurgents. You cannot even recognize the colony of heaven when it is right in front of you.”

King’s prediction of future recognition of the real heroes spread the aura of majesty, morality, and bravery from himself and the slaves to the movement’s warriors and ordinary black people, thereby continuing the time-out from universalism that began with his veneration of the ancestors. One category of heroes is “the James Merediths,” the first black to integrate the University of Mississippi, “with the noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer.”

A second set of heroes includes “old, pressed, battered, Negro women, symbolized in a seventy two year old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride segregated busses and who responded with ungrammatical profundity to one who inquired about her weariness: ‘My feets is tired, but my soul is at rest.’”

The final group of heroes encompasses all “the young high school and college students, the young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously and nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience sake.” King is shouting his praise here of the Diane Nashes and John Lewises, of Freedom Riders and SNCC organizers. Even when they are sitting down, they are standing up for what is best in the Judeo-Christian tradition and American demo cratic values.

The failure of the clergymen to commend these sacred warriors gives added force to the previous “I cannot join you.” The ultimate RSVP, it has all the gentility of a proper, timely reply to an invitation, yet it stands for a larger refusal, not quite of brotherhood as a moral ideal but of brotherhood as an emotional state, in the second half of the “Letter.” King’s decision to end on a note of rejection contrasts powerfully with all his earlier efforts in the “Letter” to assuage tensions with little rituals of restoration.

This is not the last time in the “Letter” that King goes through the motions of politesse only to take it back in spirit. Just moments later, right at the end of the “Letter,” in a couplet King gives and retracts again. Its first part is an apology in case he might have been guilty of overstatement or too zealous for change: “If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me.” What happened to the grand prophet, who did not shrink from boldly presenting himself as Paul, Amos, Moses, and even Jesus? Has he succumbed to humility?

You don’t have to wait long to discover that this is false contrition. The precise parallelism that follows replaces the first apology with a heartfelt one: “If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me.” In the end, only God’s judgment, not the white clergymen’s, matters to King.

Having consigned the clergymen to insignificance, King is now ready to close by making nice with a perfunctory form of prophecy: “Let us hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.” All that radiance is for later. In truth, the irrefutable reality of racism makes it impossible for King and the clergymen to meet as human beings. The best King can muster is the hope that “circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother.”[PART THREE](contents.html#part03)

[Now is the Time](contents.html#ch04lev1sec1)

It was time for King to get back into the fray. On April 20, after eight days behind bars, he posted bail and left the Birmingham jail. Despite his jailhouse fevers, nothing much had changed while he was out of the action. His arrest had failed to galvanize the movement as he had hoped. The force of the injunction had squelched civil disobedience and diverted protest into other channels.

The “Letter” quickly receded into the background. Although SCLC distributed it to reporters, the press ignored it. Mimeographed copies of the “Letter” appeared in black churches in May. In late May the American Friends Service Committee published it as a pamphlet with the title _Tears of Love._ In early June it began to appear in a flurry of small liberal and religious publications: the _New Leader_, the _Witness_, the _Mennonite_. It would not make its way into magazines with larger circulation until later in the summer.[^1]

If the “Letter” did not have any impact on the protests in Birmingham, its vision was about to achieve shape and vibrancy in the streets. Ironically, King would not be the prime mover in this next phase of escalation. His bolder colleagues, the youthful acolytes they had cultivated, and the students they had enlisted would be the ones to respond to the call to “extremism,” embrace the vocation of suffering, and insist, “Now is the time.” Still, all that loomed in the future. For now the movement remained in a stall.

At the press conference on the day of his release, King sported a ragged growth of beard. He mentioned that he had read a number of books in jail, including Ralph McGill’s _The South and the Southerner_. Sounding like King in the “Letter,” not to mention while preaching the parable of Dives and Lazarus, McGill wrote: “The Southerner suffers, too, from having estranged himself from much of the life about him. Segregation is estrangement. It is a withdrawal from humanity that is close at hand, that passes in the streets, that lives just over the way.”[^2]

King mentioned a second book he had read in jail, W.E.B. DuBois’s _The Souls of Black Folk_. That was the source of the early version of the “Letter’s” reference to “standing at tip toe stance.” On April 22, when King addressed the mass meeting at Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, everything in his words and inflection evoked the costs of such caution and the joy of dispensing with it. Wrapped in the protective embrace of his people, he cut loose like a man who had been released not just from jail but from all the self-restraint he had been laboring under while crafting the “Letter.” The anguished and reluctant prophet who entered Birmingham jail had vanished. He seemed to have taken Paul’s advice “[B]e ye transformed.” More likely writing the “Letter” had transformed him.[^3]

The extraordinary speech King delivered that day—really a preached version of the “Letter” refashioned for a black audience—included many of the passages from the “Letter” almost verbatim, but here punctuated with sarcastic asides and unadorned anger. The differences involved more than tone. In the “Letter,” he had used his embrace of extremism, mockery of “moderate segregationists,” and the “people get tired” mantra to justify the movement to whites and to chastise them. Addressing “my brothers and sisters” in a black church, he was using those same phrases to incite blacks to follow God’s command “to go forward.” This was the gospel of freedom designed for the unfree.

King established a Pan-African frame for what was to follow. He harkened back to a night in West Africa in 1957 when he stood with Ralph Bunche and the black congressmen Adam Clayton Powell and Charles Diggs and witnessed Kwame Nkrumah’s installation as the first president of the new nation of Ghana. Being there had called up the most primal associations, linking him, present-day Africans, and his own slave forebears in an intimate embrace. He had strolled the streets of Accra and wept with joy as he heard both young and old Ghanaians calling out “free-doom!” And then he heard an inner voice speaking the words that eventually were to ring out from the Lincoln Memorial at the March on Washington: “And I could hear that old Negro spiritual once more crying out: ‘Free at last, free at last, Great God Almighty, I’m free at last.’”[^4]

Now, six years later, in front of a mass meeting just forty-eight hours after he had left the Birmingham jail, his first impulse was to return to the birth of Ghana. “A handsome black man by the name of Kwame Nkrumah mounted the platform and told his people, ‘we are now a free and independent nation.’” King established a rhythm, talking of the “old flag coming down,” the “new one going up.” Maintaining the same chant of rising and descending flags, King now brought the audience back home: “[A]n old flag [of segregation] is coming down in Birmingham, / and a new flag is going up … / and it says every man / from a bass black to a treble white / is significant on God’s keyboard.”

Only after he had placed his audience in a broader story of black possibility and triumph did King talk about his stint in jail. Even his account of the black trustee who brought him the Birmingham newspaper with the white clergy’s Good Friday statement had a twist of racial solidarity. “You meet a friend … and they have to bring you some dinner, and they have to bring you some breakfast, and they know what you represent, and they say to you, ‘Reverend, tomorrow morning, I’ll slip the paper to you.’”

His clipped “it was kinda tough, they made it hard on us” and “they put us where they put hardened criminals” hinted at the trauma of his jail stay. In the “Letter,” he had made two brief references to jail. In one of them, after apologizing for the length of the “Letter” and for taking “so much of your precious time,” he says, “but what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers?” Now up in the black pulpit, he removed any trace of weakness or self-pity by turning the episode into a parable of black resolve and solidarity. “If you are committed, if you have faith in God, he will give you the strength to endure any ordeal. And I’m ready to go back and stay as long as necessary in order to be free and to see that my brothers and sisters in this community are free.”

With his own fighting spirit restored, King employed the full range of his rhetorical skills to rouse that spirit in his listeners. Before long, he was well into his preaching rhythm, with recurrent peaks of intensity punctuating gently surging phrases. All the while, the audience responded to King’s calls with its own shouts.

King turned the “wait means never” sequence into defiant backtalk with the lines from his first speech at the start of the Montgomery bus boycott: “But I want you to go back and tell those who are telling us to wait, ‘There comes a time when people get tired of being trampled on by the iron feet of oppression.’” With his voice breaking into tremulous near shouting, King suddenly accelerated to a quick crescendo: “And we’ve got to let this nation know that we are through with segregation, now, henceforth and forever more.” He underscored that blacks were essentially on their own. “So we’ve got to get rid of this illusion that somebody’s going to give us our freedom … _Don’t you ever think that anything is going to be given to us in this struggle!_”

As he went on, he began to heighten the urgency of the choices that lay before his listeners, pushing them over that threshold of reluctance in every way he could. He flattered them with a sense of their majesty and the grandeur of their task: “Oh, we’re together now in a beautiful way. This is marvelous and magnificent, but let us not stop at any point. For we are out to save not only ourselves, but to save this nation.” He pressured them with gently put shame and the urgency of the ticking clock: “There’s some young person here tonight who’s been clapping hands and who’s been aroused and enthusiastic about this movement but who hasn’t been willing to go all the whole way. There’s somebody here moving toward the evening of life. You need to do something before you cross the chilly Jordan.”

He heightened urgency with a burst of rhythmic repetition, whose “Now is the time” was like pulling back a slingshot before he sent them hurtling toward the Promised Land: “Now is the time to transform this dark night into a bright and glowing daybreak. Now is the time to transform this pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood … Now is the time to end desegregation and discrimination in Birmingham, Alabama … Now is the time to get up and move on towards freedom’s land.” Finally, he prepared his audience for the altar call, evoking the rewards that would come “if you will only accept the invitation: The opportunity stands before you. / Pretty soon, / in just a few seconds, / somebody will ask you / to come forward / and make a decision.”

King was now ready to bring it home, building to a climax that offered a foretaste not of eyes seeing the coming of the Lord but of ears hearing freedom bells ringing from every mountaintop. King repeated the Exodus insistence “For we are going on to freedom land,” but once again deliverance depended on a host of ifs, all of which entailed not God’s intention but the captives’ willingness to deliver themselves.

If we will stick together,

if we will pray together,

if we will work together,

if we will protest together,

we will be able to bring that day,

and all of us in Birmingham and all over America

will be able to sing with new meaning,

“My country ’tis of thee,

sweet land of liberty,

of thee I sing.

Land where my fathers died,

land of the Pilgrim’s pride,

from every mountainside,

let freedom ring.”

That must become literally true

if America is to become a great nation.

With this premonition of a nation finally united, with “all of us” singing “America” together, King’s refrain of “Let freedom ring” commanded freedom into being, from the “mighty mountains of New Hampshire” and “the prodigious hilltops of New York” and “the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado” and “the curvaceous slopes of California.” Then he extended the reach of his command: “From every mountainside, / let freedom ring. / Let it ring / from every hill and molehill in Mississippi. / Let it ring / from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee. / Let it ring / from Stone Mountain of Georgia. / Let it ring / from Red Mountain of Alabama. / From every mountainside, / let freedom ring.”

King’s burst into the lyrics of “America” was not a moment of undiluted patriotism. As we have seen, he considered America a nation in need of redemption, not a redeemer nation. His pronouncement in that Birmingham church, “If America is to be a great land,” imagined a land of liberty not yet born. It was a taunt: America was not a great land. If blacks were “to be able to sing with new meaning” “My country ’tis of thee,” if they were to sing it at all, they first had to “bring that day.” Singing “America” was thus an act of nation building: The country white Americans thought they lived in would not exist until black people created it.

[A Child Shall Lead Them](contents.html#ch04lev1sec2)

To ignite the Birmingham campaign, King would need more than his passionate preaching. He would also need to draw on the remarkable initiative of some of his colleagues, especially SCLC’s visionary, Rev. James Bevel. Ever since King’s jailing, Bevel had been raring to deploy the students of Birmingham. In the days after King’s April 20 press conference, Bevel had already been working on that task. This wasn’t his first stint at recruiting young warriors. When he and Bernard Lafayette, John Lewis’s roommate and a fellow student at American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, got out of jail in Jackson, Mississippi, after the Freedom Rides in 1961, they hooked the local black toughs with their own tough talk—“You want to fight? We’re going to fight the white folks downtown”—before reeling them in with their pacifist message.[^5]

Bevel belonged to the revered circle of Nashville nonviolent activism that included not just Lewis and Lafayette but also Diane Nash and the Reverends James Lawson, Kelly Miller Smith, and C. T. Vivian. He had come a long way from his quarrels with Lewis, whom he used to badger: “Why you always preaching the _social_ gospel and not the _Gospel_ gospel?” Once Bevel had seen the political light, he brought his trademark intensity to the task of delivering black people. The civil rights movement was not engaged in “a civil rights struggle,” he came to believe. “It’s a struggle for the Kingdom of God to come.” In 1960, when racists released a cloud of poisonous insecticide into the Nashville White Tower burger joint he and Lewis were trying to integrate, Bevel started chanting the story of the Hebrew boys in the fiery furnace who were miraculously saved after they had refused King Nebuchadnezzar’s command to bow to a false god.[^6]

Bevel returned to that story on Good Friday night—King’s first night in jail—at the Birmingham mass meeting. “You know,” Bevel said, “our [black] preachers can preach the hell out of that [story]. They just don’t believe it … But it happens today just like it did then … One day [in the Old Testament] somebody like [George] Wallace passed a decree, said everybody has to bow to his god … Rich folks, white folks and colored folks, everybody bowed … [except] … three fellows.” Why did Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego not bow? “They had freedom in their bones, I guess.”

The king put the three Hebrew boys in the furnace. Watching from heaven, Jesus asked God, “What you want me to do ’bout it? Should I go down and put the fire out?’” God told him, “Nah, don’t do that, just go down and take the heat out of it.”

Now Bevel began chanting in his high-pitched voice, blurring the line between Birmingham and the Bible, and placing his listeners—and James Meredith, who had recently integrated the University of Mississippi—into the story of the furnace of racism.

Just last fall, bless my soul,

[Governor] Barnett passed a decree,

said, “Every Negro in Mississippi

had to bow to segregation.”

James Meredith looked back at Barnett

and said, “Barnett, I don’t bow to segregation.”

Barnett looked back at Meredith and said,

“Yes, all niggers here bow to segregation.”

Said, “I’m a bad white man,

I got blond hair and blue eyes,

and I have a right to tell you

to bow to segregation …

Ohhh, you bow, nigger …

Oh, yes, nigger, you gonna bow.”

Meredith looked up at Barnett

and said, “Nah, I’m not gonna bow to segregation.”

Barnett said, “I’ll tell you something, boy:

“I got mobs and I got sheriffs and I got dogs

and I got gas, bullets and bayonets and guns.”

Said, “Nigger, if you don’t bow to segregation,

we’ll kill ya.”

They conspired to kill James Meredith

Oh, yeah, they conspired to kill the man.

That night, Bevel continued, Barnett turned loose his highway patrolmen and the hoodlums, who invaded the campus of Ole Miss and rampaged and burned and shot at federal marshals and killed people and tried to kill Meredith. Through the night, everybody was waiting, watching, wondering.

The next morning, when the sun rose, James Meredith came walking out, untouched. And a voice in the crowd could be heard, “I think I see two folks, and one of them looks like the son of God.”

This, then, was the larger point: “The God that takes care in that day takes care of folks in this day … The leader of the movement is God himself.”[^7]

Bevel’s intention was not just to remind the audience of God’s spectacular powers or those of heroes like Meredith. He aimed to elicit the spectacular powers dormant in ordinary black people. That is why, even before he intoned the Meredith part of his sermon, he told the story of the time Jesus, before curing a sick man, first asked, “Do you want to be healed? Do you want to get well?”

Slavery, segregation, and racism, Bevel pronounced, “have made a lot of people sick … so sick they haven’t realized yet they are children of God … and deserve to be treated as such … There are a lot of sick black people right here, right here in Birmingham … It has nothing to do with Bull Connor … The question comes back to the Negro people in Birmingham. Do _you_ want to be free?” Bevel wasn’t smug and superior about it; he had his own recovery story to tell. “I was tricked for years. I thought white folks were keeping me from being free … [But] white folks can’t keep us from being free. Oh no! White folks don’t control freedom … You decide.”

At the end of his address, Bevel returned to a Friday night nineteen hundred years ago. Pilate had locked up Jesus for “stirring up the folks. That’s why Martin Luther King is in jail … Same old charge. Everything is against the law when white folk don’t want it that way.” Pilate was thinking, “Yeah, we get rid of this Jesus fellow and that will do it, because Peter and them is half scared anyway.” But then came Sunday, “and bless my soul, for the first time, a dead man got up and walked around.” These white folks “don’t have sense enough to understand the resurrection yet. You can put folks in jail, it don’t make any difference … [for when the] Holy Ghost get in a man, he’s bound to resurrect.”

Suddenly, Bevel felt the Holy Ghost moving again, and “in Alabama and Georgia, I see Negroes coming to life, dead men … We’ve been sitting here dead for all these years and all we got to do is just get up and start walking.”[^8]

During the last ten days of April, Bevel, Andrew Young, and Young’s colleague Dorothy Cotton intensified their efforts to get Birmingham’s young people to get up and start walking. They zeroed in on students in preparation for what came to be called the Children’s Crusade, keying their proselytizing to the rhythms of the young and their school schedules. They were aided by local young blacks, many of them only a few years out of high school. Awakened to the gospel of freedom, some of them became evangelists themselves.[^9]

The conversion of Andrew Marrisett was emblematic of the way the movement was stirring the consciousness of black Birmingham. He had been “blindly engrossed” in the “Christian thing,” not thinking much about segregation. One day the twenty-seven-year-old-was driving by Kelly Ingram Park when he spotted a policeman siccing a K-9 dog on a little girl. On an impulse, he jumped out of his vehicle, stepped in front of the dog, and was arrested. In a flash, he dedicated himself to the movement, “life or death.”[^10]

Upon his release that night, Marrisett headed straight for the mass meeting, met Andrew Young and James Bevel, and went to work mobilizing the young. Thus began his career as a member of that special fraternity of SCLC foot soldiers. Like the early Christians, he went from town to town imbued with his faith, registering voters, doing advance work for King speeches, leading bouts of freedom singing. The children of Selma named Marrisett their hero. When they rejoiced that the brutal sheriff Jim Clark had become sick, Marrisett told them to stop: “We should pray for Brother Clark. Pray that he will get well today and that tomorrow he will let our parents register to vote … They were real enthused about hating what he does but loving him as a human being.”[^11]

As in Jackson, young people in Birmingham relished the provocateur in Bevel. Andrew Young, who spent much time overseeing the basic training in nonviolence, recalls Bevel’s approach to macho teens. “Well, they all said they couldn’t be nonviolent. But Bevel’s answer was, ‘How many people did you kill last week? When was the last time you punched a white boy?’” When they gave less than pugnacious answers, Bevel called them cowards. Once they had cleared away the mystique of manhood, the leaders worked to instill in their charges the sacred ideal of reconciliation. Young continues: They told the recruits that violence “wouldn’t produce anything but your own imprisonment or death. We’d explain to them that nonviolence is a method that allows you to confront evil without becoming evil. You don’t overcome hatred with more hatred, see. And we’d say, ‘We’re not trying to destroy this city, we’re trying to save it’ … And everybody would agree to that.”[^12]

To reinforce the message of restraint, Young and his colleagues screened films on Gandhi and the Montgomery bus boycott. The students were especially captivated by _Sit-in_, Robert Young’s CBS television documentary on the brave and idealistic students who desegregated the lunch counters of Nashville. One of them was a young John Lewis, who pinpointed the spiritual character of sitting down at a lunch counter as “presenting one’s humanity” to white people. He disclosed the moving feeling of “demanding my God-given rights.” Convinced in the righteousness of his cause, “my soul became satisfied … something deep down within me was moving me, I could no longer be satisfied in going along with an evil system … I had to be maladjusted to it and in spite of this I had to keep loving the people who denied me service.”[^13]

Despite all this activity, the protests remained at an impasse through the end of April, thwarted by the injunction, a dwindling supply of protesters willing to be jailed, and King’s reluctance to put young people in harm’s way. Bull Connor’s restraint had deprived the movement of the theater needed to transfix the nation. King also had to prepare for his contempt trial for violating the injunction as well as plot legal strategy for the appeal of his expected guilty verdict.

The week included a meeting with three of the white clergymen who had written the Good Friday statement criticizing the protests. The encounter, Young says sardonically, “did not go well.” After Bishop Charles Carpenter kept repeating the same criticism that had provoked King in the first place, George Murray, his fellow Episcopalian, acknowledged: “All of us have been guilty; we have not done what we ought to have done.” Shuttlesworth countered: “You confess just like white folks confess and go right on doing the same thing.” The lone rabbi among the eight, Milton Grafman, bridled at the word “merchants” in the “Letter,” believing the term to be anti-Semitic code. With its author in the room, Grafman complained that King had “implied that the problem was the Jews.”[^14]

Later that night, at the mass meeting, it was clear that King’s apparent disdain for “these preachers” had not diminished. They were utterly fixated on “outsiders,” he explained. “We have to be patient with them; they are all pitiful. They think we outsiders are Communists.”[^15]

As May approached, the media were decamping and the national news coverage was diminishing. King began to worry. “You know, we’ve got to get something going. The press is leaving, we’ve got to get going.” In David Garrow’s summary, a local minister “was astounded by King’s emphasis on pragmatic rather than spiritual considerations.” Wyatt Tee Walker spoke bluntly of the movement’s structural fragility: “We had run out of troops. We had scraped the bottom of the barrel of adults who could go [[to jail].” Sensing the movement’s weakness, the white leaders pulled out of negotiations. The cries to unleash the restless army of the young mounted.[^16]

The way out of no way began with a bit of devilry. With King, Abernathy, and Shuttlesworth out of town between April 27 and May 1, preaching on the weekend and then on Monday and Tuesday at an SCLC board meeting in Memphis, Bevel set a date for D-day, a Gandhian’s ironic tribute to the invasion of Normandy during World War II. On May 2, a Thursday, students were to dash from school and gather at Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, absorb the catechism of non-violence, and press the assault on segregation.

Arriving back in Birmingham for the Wednesday night mass meeting on May 1, King still had not signed off on the youth uprising that was just hours from takeoff. But he was clearly delighted by the turnout at the packed church: “It is a marvelous development and whenever oppressed people decide that they are gonna be free, there’s nothing in all the world can stop them from being free.” For the next half hour a spirited King shifted from jocular to lofty, from proud to prophetic. His aim throughout was to buck up the fighting spirit. The Negroes of Birmingham were “battering rams” crushing “the sagging walls of segregation.” They would “no longer sell our birthright of freedom for a mess of segregated pottage.” King closed with this timeless advice: “Whenever you see a great fight, get in it. And I want to tell you, there’s a great fight taking place.”[^17]

King made no mention of the rebellion planned for the next morning. The prophet still lagged behind renegade youth. Earlier that evening another one of the young warriors in the Bevel-Shuttlesworth orbit had disclosed the edge of generational pride and recrimination, the themes of failed fathers and cowardly elders that were churning in the cauldron King liked to call the zeitgeist. “Tomorrow,” William “Meatball” Dothard told the church, “students are gonna show you old folks what you should have done forty years ago. They’re gonna make you ashamed to see that they have to go through what you should have gone through earlier for them, to make their life better. [They] don’t want their parents to work five days a week making 15 dollars a week cooking for somebody else, still be called ‘girl’ … They want their mom called ‘Mrs.’”

Brushing aside the parents’ anxiety, Meatball pointed out that every night the adults themselves sang this verse of “I’m on My Way to Freedom Land”: “If you don’t go, don’t you hinder me.’” A moment later he merged the voice of an eight-year-old boy who had gone to jail with a line from “I Woke Up One Morning with My Mind Stayed on Freedom”: “Do you know why [he decided to go to jail]? He said he ‘woke up that Saturday morning with freedom on my mind’ … Let them go get what you supposed to have gotten a long time ago … Parents, don’t hinder the kids in the morning, guardians, don’t mess with the kids in the morning, teachers, don’t take your roll books in the morning.” A wave of laughter, cheering, and clapping swept through the church.

The colony of heaven the students were about to enact around Kelly Ingram Park didn’t look quite as somber as the early Christians King had saluted in the “Letter.” At times D-day had the antic feel of adolescent pranksters whose cachet with the prom queens and football stars helped touch off a stampede of mass hooky at Birmingham’s black high schools.

On Thursday morning, Shelley “The Playboy” Stewart, one of the DJs at the local soul station, beckoned not so cryptically: “Kids, there’s gonna be a party at the park. Bring your toothbrushes because lunch will be served.” More than a thousand students skipped school. The principal at one high school locked the gates to keep his charges inside; they fled through windows and over back fences. They made their way to Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. They clapped hands, sang “Woke Up This Morning with My Mind Stayed on Freedom,” and attended workshops on nonviolence. An elated Fred Shuttlesworth darted in and out of the small groups, delivering “rousing sermonettes” to the youthful insurgents he dubbed “freedom fighters, as much so as those in the army. But without weapons.”[^18]

To dispel the intimidating aura of white policemen, Bevel enacted a sociodrama of outrageous nerve. He took a group of students right into the belly of the beast, Bull Connor’s office. “Mr. Connor,” Bevel reported to him, “I explained to them that the policemen’s job is to arrest them, and as long as they don’t cuss them, there’s nothing for them to be afraid of.” Connor, who had no idea of what was in store, replied, “That’s right.”[^19]

A bit after one P.M., lines of laughing and clapping students burst forth from the church, singing “We Shall Overcome” and “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around.” Vast numbers of small children and older teens overwhelmed the police force with fearless requests to be locked up. Connor was teetering at the edge of his control. “You could see Bull moving, looking, concerned, fidgety,” recalled one officer. “He was just desperate. ‘What the hell do I do?’” Policemen hauled away hundreds of youthful demonstrators first in police cars and then in paddy wagons. By the end of the day the jails were bursting with six hundred new prisoners.[^20]

King finally embraced the students. Necessity—the imminent risk of defeat, the mere trickle of black adults prepared to go to jail, and the daring of others who went forward while their leader vacillated—pushed him to accept the idea of the youth protest. Yet King had been touched in a powerful way. At the mass meeting that night there was a lilt in his voice as he gloried in the “magnificence” of it all. He had been “deeply inspired and moved” by “the hundreds and hundreds of students in this community. I have never seen anything quite like it.” Better yet, “They did it singing the great soul songs of the freedom movement. And one can never grasp the meaning of this movement until he understands the music, with all of its glad thunders and gentle sighs, expressing the deep longings and aspirations of an oppressed people.”[^21]

There was a chorus of denouncers. Unsurprisingly, Mayor-elect Boutwell disapproved. Malcolm X snorted: “Real men don’t put their children on the firing line.” Attorney General Robert Kennedy admonished the protest’s leaders: “[A]n injured, maimed, or dead child is a price that none of us can afford to pay.” Bevel admitted to a mass meeting that once he too would have exempted the most vulnerable blacks—children, mothers, and black men with jobs—from the risks of white punishment for activism. But he had come to realize that “Christ himself could not exempt you from the struggle. Can you imagine … yourself going up to the gates of heaven, lining up behind John, who’s walking with his head in his hands, he’s lost it fighting for the Kingdom? … Every person that knows anything about God ought to be involved in the struggle for the Kingdom.”[^22]

In letting himself be carried by the flow of Bevel’s prophecy, King was practicing what he preached in “Transformed Nonconformist”: recapturing “the gospel glow of the early Christians,” following the call of conviction, obeying “the command not to conform” of “our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, the world’s most dedicated nonconformist.” And didn’t he and his fellow ministers grant that children as young as six were old enough to receive Christ? In King’s own telling, when Robert Kennedy, afraid for the children’s safety, called to ask him to jettison the Children’s Crusade, King parried: “[Black children] are hurt every day. The minute they’re born until the day they die, they’re hurt in a much more damaging way. They’re hurt spiritually. They’re hurt and killed psychologically. And so it’s the moral of the thing to see them ready to march now so that if they get hurt physically, it will forecall [_sic_] the attention of the world to it. Something will be done about it …”[^23]

Within days King was quelling the parents’ murmuring by casting their children as young saviors. “And don’t worry about your children. They are going to be all right. Don’t hold them back if they want to go to jail. For they are doing a job not only for themselves but for all of America and for all mankind.”

Suddenly, King sidled into scripture: “Somewhere we read, a little child shall lead them,” and now the audience was giving its assent at every pause with its amens and wells. “And remember there was another little child just twelve years old, and he got involved in a discussion back in Jerusalem as his parents moved down the dusty road leading them back to their little village of Nazareth. And when they got back and bothered him and touched him and wanted him to move on, at that moment he said, ‘I must be about my Father’s business.’ These young people are about their Father’s business. And they are carving a tunnel of hope through the great mountain of despair and they will bring to this nation a newness and a genuine quality and idealism that it so desperately needs.” This was the inner ecclesia busting out of the “Letter.”[^24]

The real payoff came the day after D-day. On Double D-day, Friday, May 3, more than a thousand students heard King at Sixteenth Street Baptist Church celebrate the virtues of jail. Chanting “freedom” to the tune of the gospel song “Amen,” wave after wave of freedom warriors surged into the streets, where they again refused to bow to Bull Connor. This time Connor took the bait. The Children’s Crusade with its naive, exuberant marchers—and the sheer numbers of them—had baffled and goaded the lawman where the determined but subdued protests of Eastertide had failed. Connor called for the high-pressure fire hoses and water cannons that could strip bark from trees and bricks from buildings. The police warning to “disperse or you’ll get wet” did not deter the young. The firemen raised the water pressure, and the protesters, as Glenn Eskew describes the scene, “dropped to their knees, then grasped each other, bonding bodies with souls to withstand the force.” Needles of water ripped shirts and lacerated skin, bloodied noses, and lifted small children over cars.[^25]

Formerly cheering but now enraged onlookers rained bricks and bottles on the police and firemen. The appearance of the K-9 corps further incensed them. The German shepherds stretched the slack in their leashes, lunged, and bit. Connor was heard to cry, “I want to see the dogs work. Look at those niggers run.” One of the dogs sank his teeth into the belly of Walter Gadsden, a politically disengaged bystander clad in a cardigan sweater. A. G. Gaston, the black millionaire who opposed the protests, was on the phone with one of the white moderates, exchanging wishes that King would leave town. Suddenly he saw children skittering down the street under the force of the hoses. “Lawyer Vann,” he said, ‘I can’t talk to you now or ever. My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them.”[^26]

Stark black-and-white _resources/books//Gospel of Freedom_ Martin Luther King, Jr. - Jonathan Rieder of this brutality flowed out to the nation and world. Dropping its recent criticism of King, the _New York Times_ condemned “the national disgrace.” The paper ran a three-column-wide photograph of the dog attack on Gadsden. The headline read DOGS AND HOSES REPULSE NEGROES AT BIRMINGHAM. That image left President Kennedy aghast. New York’s liberal Republican senator Jacob Javits said, “The conscience of America must be very deeply troubled.” Oregon senator Wayne Morse analogized Birmingham to apartheid in South Africa.[^27]

At last, Bull Connor had become the star of the spectacle the movement needed to dramatize oppression and galvanize the nation. His fire hoses and snarling dogs were now props in the movement’s theater. King’s claim in the “Letter” that “creative tension” might arouse the nation’s conscience would finally undergo rigorous testing.

Right after Connor’s rampage, King temporarily sounded subdued at the mass meeting, as if the nakedness of white depravity had deprived him of his capacity for exalted rhetoric. “The day was a dark day in Birmingham. The policemen were mean to us,” he declared slowly, plaintively, with almost childlike simplicity. “They got their violence and resolve and turned them loose on nonviolent people. Unarmed people. But not only that, they got their water system working, and here and there we saw the water hose with water pouring on young boys and girls, old men and women, with great and staggering force.”[^28]

Moments later, with echoes of the “Letter’s” “Who is their God?” King’s anger flared, and he said with barely controlled wrath, “Let’s let them get their dogs and let them get their hoses, and we’ll leave them covered with their own barbarity. We will leave them standing before their God and the world splattered with the blood and reeking with the stench of our Negro brothers.”

The breach between _our_ brothers and _their_ God soon widened into a chasm between black and white. King told the story of spotting a tank and someone’s telling him, “That’s Bull Connor’s tank.” King told the audience: “And you know it’s a white tank,” provoking their laughter. But King’s tone was deadly serious and coldly defiant. “Now I want to say tonight that they can bring their dogs out, they can get their water, and even Bull Connor can get his white tanks, and our black faces will stand up before the white tank.” The audience erupted again.

Over the next week King never stopped agitating for action. At one of the nightly meetings, he even abandoned the pretense of argument, propelling the people into action through sheer will, the theology of hope translated into the kinetic force of his incantation: “Keep this movement going! / “Keep this movement rolling! / In spite of the difficulties! / And we are going to have / A few more difficulties! / Keep climbing, keep moving.” As the people joined in, King broke into a near shout: “If you can’t fly, run! / If you can’t run, walk! / If you can’t walk, crawl! / But by all means keep moving!”[^29]

Each day of the entire week after D-day had its own drama. There were occasions for hijinks and hilarity. With the help of walkie-talkies and decoys, the students juked and faked and feinted in end runs around the police as they broke through to the downtown, where unnerved whites were engulfed by exuberant blacks. Wyatt Tee Walker didn’t tell King he was dispatching troops to turn in false fire alarms. In their own version of the slaves’ ring shout, the students took the tune of “The Old Grey Mare” and sang the words “I ain’t scared of your jail / ’cause I want my freedom! / … want my freedom!” as they “broke into a fast step that seemed to be a hybrid of the turkey-trot and the twist,” the dance craze of the early 1960s.[^30]

The carnival spirit spilled into the meetings. Jokes undercut fear, ramped up black power, and cut Bull Connor down to size. Rejoining white racist cries that blacks go back to Africa, Abernathy gave this folksier version of King’s “We were here,” announcing that he wasn’t going back to Africa until—here he recited a long list of émigrés, including the Irish going back to Ireland, the English going back to England, the Germans going back to Germany, whose culmination set off an uproar—_the white man gives this country back to the Indians_.[^31]

On another night, after King wandered into a bit of inadvertent lewdness, Abernathy made him his straight man. King had given a disquisition on various Greek words for “love,” including _agape_, or God’s selfless love, and _philea_, or friendship. When he came to _eros,_ King explained that it “might be the way your lover walks.” Abernathy pounced, teasing in breathy exaggeration: “He says that eraaas is that type of love that moooves you. And he went on to say what it might be.” Here Abernathy began a syncopated rhythm that bordered on the profane—“It might be the way your lover walks. And it might be the way your lover talks”—and then shifted on a dime: “I was glad he didn’t tell you what it _really_ is.”[^32]

At times Abernathy went to the edge of minstrelsy with his vignettes. Often prefaced with “Negroes are not afraid of white folks any longer,” even his burlesques of rural blacks served a higher purpose of fortifying his listeners’ nerve. One of them turned on a plantation Negro who goes out to milk the cows and comes upon his boss, whom he fails to address with the deferential “Mr. Charlie.” The white man asks solicitously, “John, now tell me, are you sick? … You know you have no business calling me _Charlie_. Do you want me to take you to the hospital?” “No,” replies the Negro, “I just want to know how is Ann doing.” The boss says, “Now I know something is wrong with ya, you calling ‘Miss Ann’ _Ann_.” The black man explains that the Freedom Riders had come through and told him about his rights. “From now on, you ain’t going to be no Mr. Charlie, you just Charlie.” And no more “Miss Ann,” just _Ann_. There wasn’t even going to be Mississippi, “just plain Ssippi.” The response of the audience was unabashed glee.[^33]

The mood could be amazed as much as playful. In 2005, Andrew Marrisett was still marveling at a face-off with Bull Connor. On the Sunday after D-day, this gentle Christian warrior found himself in a line of a thousand people marching to the Birmingham jail. They approached Bull Connor. Andrew Young called for everybody to kneel and pray. As Young and Walker went to talk to Connor, Reverend Charles Billups, the man tied to a tree and branded by the Klan years before, cried out, “The Lord is with this movement! Off your knees. We’re going on to the jail!”

The crowd moved toward the barricades. A stunned Bull Connor ordered them to stop, but as Young saw from his up-close vantage, “the police … just stood there watching us as if they were transfixed.” The police dogs calmed. “Bull Connor was yelling, ‘Turn on the hoses, turn on the hoses!’” Marrisett could hear the woman next to him praying, “Don’t let the fire hoses come on.” He swears he saw one of the firemen turning the lever, “but no water came out. This is a fact.” He remembers thinking, _This is truly a miracle_. As for Young, “I saw one fireman, tears in his eyes, just let the hose drop at his feet. Our people marched right between the red fire trucks, singing, ‘I want Jesus to walk with me.’” As the group moved through the barricades, an older woman shouted, “Great God Almighty done parted the Red Sea one mo’ time!”[^34]

The insurgency even provided the stage for an exalted enactment of the declaration of the “Letter,” “I am in Birmingham because injustice is here.” As a delegation of out-of-state rabbis in yarmulkes and prayer shawls walked down the aisles of a mass meeting, blacks stood and greeted them with rapturous applause. They were invited to speak from the pulpit. “As Jews who had seen the Germans overrun Europe,” one rabbi explained, “[we] hoped always to lend succor against oppression anywhere.” The two groups traded songs as well as stories of suffering. Rabbi Andre Ungar, who had left South Africa because he opposed apartheid, later wrote, “The roof and high heaven itself shuddered with delight when a thousand and many more hundreds Negroes and nineteen itinerant Jews, sang together in Hebrew about the goodness and loveliness of brothers who live together in unity. And ‘Hevenu Shalom Alekhem,’ yes, it is peace that we have brought unto you.” Then it was the turn of the black freedom fighters to teach “our rabbis,” as they deemed their guests, an unfamiliar song, “We Shall Overcome.” The rabbis chanted it with deep spiritual emotion. “Drenched with perspiration,” Ungar wrote, “[we were] weak with too much love given and received.”[^35]

No matter what the mood, the threat of violence never faded. When Fred Shuttlesworth was hospitalized after fire hoses sent him slamming into a building, Connor snapped, “I wish they’d carried him away in a hearse.” As the days went by, black bystanders heaving rocks and bricks cast a shadow over the event, forcing Young, Walker, and Bevel to race around to dissuade them from their mayhem. But warnings had to go out not just to the denizens of “the dives,” but to the movement’s own legions. Restraint was always precarious. As a result, King and the others had to constantly fortify it. “If we turned to violence,” he said, “Governor Wallace would rear back in his comfortable chair in the statehouse in Montgomery with great joy throbbing throughout his heart and his being.” The protesters could then be charged with inciting a riot, martial law declared, and the state troopers unleashed.

The taboo on violence was never separate from the Christian message of love. King did not try to suppress dislike of the white man so much as reframe it. “Now we say in this nonviolent movement that you gotta love this white man, he needs our love. And God knows he needs our love.” King reassured that he wasn’t talking about “emotional bosh” or “sentimental emotion.” _Agape_ was more cerebral, “the redemptive love of God operating in the human heart.” The more King spelled it out, the love did not seem flattering to the beloved: “You love those that you don’t like. You love those whose ways are distasteful to you. You love every man because God loves him … I can’t like Mr. Connor, but Jesus says, ‘Love him,’ and love is greater than like … Yes, love is even the willingness to die on a cross in order that others may live.”[^36]

Throughout the first ten days of May, the students kept coming. The city’s jails filled and spilled into the yards. Business plummeted in the downtown. Fear of disorder had the added benefit of keeping white shoppers away. The movement’s fitful, furtive talks with the merchants developed into secret negotiations with Sidney Smyer and a reluctant Senior Citizens Committee. As the broad outlines of a deal emerged amid continuing violence, King agreed to a one-day moratorium in the demonstrations.[^37]

On May 8, before its details were finalized, Shuttlesworth almost scuttled the agreement. Fretting that King might cave at the apex of movement leverage to secure his larger national ends, he left his hospital bed and went to the scene of the negotiations. As he recalled the episode, he said to King, “ ‘Did I hear you right?’ He said, ‘We have decided to call off the demonstrations.’ I said, ‘Well, Martin, _who_ decided? … [I]t’s hard for me to see … how anybody could decide that without me … We’re not calling anything off … You know, they _said_ in Albany that you come in, get people excited and started, and you leave town … But I live here, the people trust me … and I’m telling you it will not be called off.”

At this point King broke in: “Now[,] Fred, don’t say it like that.” Shuttlesworth had thought the leaders had agreed to make joint decisions. “I’ll be damned if you’ll have it like this. You’re mister big, but you’re going to be mister S-H-I-T. I’m sorry, but I cannot compromise my principles and the principles that we established.”[^38]

Shuttlesworth stormed out of the house. He only grudgingly endorsed the settlement after a phone call from Robert Kennedy. But black and white negotiators ratified the settlement. On May 10, the movement announced its victory. The terms included desegregating the changing rooms, water fountains, bathrooms, and lunch counters. The White Only signs would come down. Blacks would be hired for nonmenial jobs. An interracial committee would be established to explore grievances, and those in jail would be released. A momentous agreement had been struck in a capital city of segregation.[^39]

At the mass meeting that night, alert to Shuttlesworth’s miffed feelings, Abernathy praised him abundantly, but when he introduced King, he exulted: “God sent him to lead us to freedom.” King was in fine spirits as he reviewed the details of the victory, but he was looking mainly beyond the immediate battle. Calls, he reported, were pouring in from black communities across the South. They were eager to take the baton from Birmingham.

King readied the audience to live in this new world, prodding it to see its achievement “in the perspective of eternity.” After all, the ultimate credit and glory had to be given to “the almighty God. For he has clearly been at work among us and it is he alone who has finally gained a victory for all of his children.” The important thing was not the minutiae of this point or that concession but “a new brotherhood, where men are free to know and respect and love each other … a magic city where color will no longer be the measure of a man’s worth, where character will matter more than pigmentation.”

Echoing the control of the first half of the “Letter,” King called for “calm dignity and wise restraint. Emotion must not run wild.” The victory was not a “victory for the Negro” over the white man. It was a victory “for democracy and the whole citizenry of Birmingham, Negro and white.” King warned against gloating. When they returned to the integrated public facilities, they must avoid being “haughty in spirit.” And don’t forget to step into the shoes of “those who have opposed us.” Appreciate “the new adjustments” that integration “pose for them. We must be loving enough to turn an enemy into a friend.”[^40]

The next night a powerful bomb blew apart the home of King’s brother, Rev. A. D. King, also an activist preacher, and a good portion of the Gaston Motel, including the room right under King’s. The blast went off around closing time of the bars. Mindful that the rougher element would be moving onto the sidewalks, white terrorists may have aimed to provoke rioting in the hopes it would destroy the settlement. In the “Letter,” King had warned of the wrath that the dashed expectations of blacks might yield. Birmingham was about to get a preview of what that might look like.

Thousands of enraged blacks took to the streets. They slashed tires, hurled rocks, broke windows, and burned down a store. The crowd dragged a white man out of a taxi, beat him, and set the cab on fire. As payback for decades of beatings, humiliation, and murder, blacks attacked policemen. One of Bull Connor’s officers darted down a dark alley after rock throwers; he wobbled back with knife wounds.[^41]

Rising up from the streets, a black man’s chant, “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,” issued a vaguely theological comeback to the movement’s brief for nonviolence. From improvised outdoors pulpits, Wyatt Tee Walker, James Bevel, and others from SCLC and ACMHR tried to rebut it. Hours after the explosion had nearly killed his own family, Rev. A. D. King prayed out in the street: “Oh, God, we pray that thou wouldst give us at this hour the Spirit of Patience. Give us the spirit of love.” But he also satisfied the crowd’s thirst for vengeance, if only by delegating it to higher power: “Whoever it was who threw those bombs tonight, God knows their names. He knows their address. He knows the side of the bed that they sleep on … God is going to pay them [back] for what they have done to us.”[^42]

The other face of the zeitgeist had revealed itself. As the historian Dan Carter describes him, a “plainly flustered” George Wallace grasped the turning point he was witnessing. In the words of two political scientists who studied the rioting, “The passivity and nonviolence of American Negroes could never again be taken for granted … The ‘rules of the game’ in race relations were permanently changed in Birmingham.”[^43]

The rioting gave Wallace the nudge he barely needed. In the first hours of Sunday morning, he sent the state troopers to quell the violence. Armed with automatic carbines, bayonets, and double-barrel shotguns, they mauled rioters and bystanders with equal ferocity. When Wyatt Tee Walker’s wife didn’t move quickly enough to suit the troopers, one of them cracked her head with a rifle butt, sending her to the hospital. From across the street, the _New York Times_ reporter Claude Sitton heard “the thonk” of billy clubs against human flesh. “The state troopers had gone as berserk as the rampaging Negroes before their arrival,” a radio journalist from New York City’s WBAI reported from outside the Gaston Motel.[^44]

The violence of the state was the physical expression of an ideology of white supremacy that would not go gently into the night. On D-day, George Wallace had sworn to the Alabama State Assembly that he would squelch “agitators” and “integrationists” who aimed to “destroy the freedom of Americans everywhere.” Twenty-one times the legislators applauded him.[^45]

Not long after the bombing, when President Kennedy moved federal troops to Alabama bases, Birmingham’s lame-duck mayor, Art Hanes, fulminated against “bayonet brotherhood”: “They gonna tell the people of Birmingham, ‘You’ll love this nigger at the point of a bayonet, whether you want to or not’ … This is Socialism of the rankest sort.” For forty days Negroes had been pushing white people around, and enough was enough. If it hadn’t been for the state troopers, “that mob of wild Negroes Saturday night would have sacked and burned Birmingham.”[^46]

King missed the melee. He had left Birmingham Saturday to be back in Atlanta to preach on Sunday. The exhausted leader reported to the congregation that “vicious mobsters” had bombed his brother’s home and the Gaston Motel. He had been up all night fielding phone calls every half hour from Birmingham. Wyatt Tee Walker’s wife remained in the hospital after the state troopers ran amok. “These are dark days when men can stoop to the point of beating women for no reasons ’cept simply it’s because they are colored and they want to be free.” But he had news for the forces that opposed them: “[We] ain’t gonna let State Troopers turn us around. We ain’t gonna let Gov. Wallace turn us around. We ain’t gonna let Bull Connor turn us around.”[^47]

That Sunday was Mother’s Day, and the title of King’s sermon was “What a Mother Should Tell Her Child.” At one point, he delivered to black mothers a variant of the “Letter’s” chronicle of black affliction. “You’ve seen [the evil of racial injustice] … in the crying voice of a little Emmett L. Till, screaming from the rushing waters in Mississippi … maybe in a little child asking you, ‘Momma, why do white people treat colored people so mean?’ … You stood there tongue-twisted and words stammering, trying to explain to that little child that Funtown is closed to colored children … Get it over to your child,” he urged the mothers. “He must never be content until segregation is removed from every area of this country.” Prepare the children “to get in a good fight.”

At the end of the sermon, King comforted the congregation with the thought that “God is able.” Life’s journey is like the launching of a grand ship: The crowd cheers; the band plays. Then you sail out from the harbor, and “the tempestuous seas of despair will begin to roll before ya.” But if you know God, you will endure the storms. “Are you torn within and somehow beaten from without? Cry, _God is able_! Are you somehow giving up in the struggle for life because of some glaring disappointment? Why, _God is able_! … Are you despairing about the slow pace of integration? Why, _God is able_!”

In another sermon actually entitled “Our God Is Able,” which he originally drafted in the mid-1950s, King told of a moment of dread during the Montgomery bus boycott. After a late-night telephone death threat that began “Nigger,” he succumbed to worry and despair. He was faltering, losing his courage. That was the night he put aside the abstractions of theology. He heard a voice telling him to call on the God “your Daddy used to tell you about. That power that can make a way out of no way.” Sometimes when King preached that moment, you could hear him near sobbing as he broke into the lyrics of the hymn “Never Alone”: “I’ve seen the lightning flash. / I’ve heard the thunder roll. / I felt sin-breakers dashing, / trying to conquer my soul. / But I heard the voice of Jesus / saying still to fight on.” King would then fall into a chant, like a haunted man who could not stop repeating: “He promised never to leave me, / never to leave me alone. / No, never alone.”[^48] The command that accompanied that promise, “Martin Luther, stand up for justice,” renewed the leader so he could return to the bus boycott. When a bomb ripped through his house a few days after that threat, he retained a deep sense of calm.

After the Mother’s Day sermon, King headed back to Birmingham to minister to the wounds of his people. “These persons were seeking to _assassinat_e us,” he told the good church people at New Pilgrim Baptist Church. But he would not let them yield to despair. As the audience bucked him up with their “Man!” and “Amen!” King bade them “see God’s children struggling to get out of the hands of an oppressive Pharaoh. Not long after that, watch the Red Seas, as they began to roll back; watch God’s children as they walk safely to the other side—How long? Not long.”

King brought that same tenderness to assuaging the thirst for revenge in the juke joints and poolrooms of Birmingham. Typically, in such settings, King played the sucker, trying to figure out which end of the cue to use before he ran the table. But the wounds were too raw for such niceties at every one of his stops that day. “_I_ believe in nonviolence as a _creed_,” he declared with no trace of self-righteousness, but “I hope _you_ will see” that violence “is _impractical_.” He also appealed to people’s sense of racial solidarity; more violence would only threaten a settlement that was a real advance for black people. Before trying to vitiate their fury, he first validated it, then joined them in the furious black “we.” “I can understand how impatient we are … how these dread and deep-seated resentments well up in our souls … how we are often driven to the brink of bitterness, and even despair.”[^49]

All this was part of the vocation of suffering, comforting and calming his people. He had been the target of the assassination plot, yet here he was, steadying others. Aside from the God who promised never to leave him, who would sustain King?

In fact, the spirit did not flow only from King to others. Over the course of that entire frenetic two-week period in May, something more earthly than God’s promise to be with him buoyed King: the defiant grace shown by the people of Birmingham—or, as he saw it, the earthly manifestations of a more ethereal grace. At the May 10 mass meeting, he declared that he did not know if he had inspired the blacks of Birmingham, but they had certainly inspired him. He was acknowledging the almost physical way he drew strength from the very people whose spirits he sought to fortify.

In the late 1950s, when he still lived in Montgomery, King had come up to Birmingham to preach at Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. His driver, a young deacon, was stunned by what he heard. “Reverend King, you whooped today. I never heard you whoop at Dexter.” “Well,” King said with a smile, “the sisters at Dexter never talk to me when I am preaching like the old sisters did here today.”[^50]

For an entire week after D-day, the young sisters and brothers of Birmingham had been “talking” to King, sweeping away his caution with their exuberance and infusing his rhetoric with their fire. It’s not that he was superfluous. But the students were the ones who had acted out all the themes of the “Letter”: the need for the oppressed to free themselves; the morality of breaking unjust laws like the injunction and segregation statutes; the urgency of rejecting patience; the sacredness of sacrifice; and the exceptional spirit of black people contained in the “Letter’s” avowal, “If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery couldn’t stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail.”

The difference now was that King was offering praise for defiance not as hope, history, or prophecy. The grit and mettle of black people lay right before him; that was why he kept filling up with wonder throughout the mass meetings. Their militancy was “marvelous.” They were “making history.” Above all, they possessed an ineffable power.

“They get the dogs,” King told one mass meeting, “and they soon discover that dogs can’t stop us. They get the fire hose. They fail to realize that water can only put out physical fire. But water can never drown the fire of freedom.” In another meeting, King assumed the voice of the oppressor: “We tried to use water on them, and we soon discovered that they were used to water, for they were Methodists or Episcopalians or other denominations, and they had been sprinkled. And even those who hadn’t been sprinkled happen to have been Baptists. And not only did they stand up in the water, they went under the water.”[^51]

It was late on Double D-day. The brutal baptism of the hoses had abated; Kelly Ingram Park was quiet. King stared out at the pews from the pulpit. What did he see in that army of innocence that Young, Bevel, and Cotton had assembled if not a reflection of his own arguments in the “Letter”? “We have a weapon much stronger than any physical weapon,” King pointed out. “We have the weapon of our souls. And we can become the spiritual anvils that will wear out many physical hammers. And we will be able to say all over this nation that we struggle with love in our hearts, with justice as our goal, and we had on the breastplate of righteousness and the whole armor of God and we marched in order to move on into that land where all of God’s children are free indeed. God bless you.”[^52]

[Free at Last?](contents.html#ch04lev1sec3)

The settlement survived black rioting and the troopers’ wilding. The streets calmed and the city returned to its own version of normality. One could imagine the eight clergymen who provoked the “Letter” might now be ready to grapple with King’s critique of a church of conformity. If they had taken umbrage on a first reading, Bull Connor’s dogs, the tangible image of child-warriors with love in their heart, and the viciousness of Wallace’s state troopers could have revealed to them the identity of the real extremists.

The protests if not the “Letter” did seem to have nudged Reverend Earl Stallings at First Baptist Church toward a more supportive stance. A few Sundays after D-day, he preached that Pontius Pilate had disavowed “personal responsibility for righteousness and justice” and “wanted nothing to upset his little kingdom. But are we any different?” Did we really believe “our freedoms, our privileges … are for all men?” He told his worshippers, many of them glowering, that they had to “choose between truth and the prejudices which bolster racial pride … They march out of the doors of Negro churches in our Southland. We may deplore their methods. We may question their motives. We may be shocked at their shock-troops consisting of elementary-age children, but still they march. Shall the Christian remain alarmingly indifferent?”[^53]

Stallings was the exception. Many of the eight responded dismissively or defensively. In the words of Methodist Bishop Nolan Harmon, “The letter helped make Dr. King famous over the nation, but did not help us in Birmingham. I doubt that Dr. King thought it would … The fact is that none of us paid much attention to the letter.” Some considered the “Letter” a publicity stunt; they were upset that King never sent it to them. Rabbi Grafman’s lament—King said things that “hurt us”—stood for a more general small-mindedness. Whatever collateral damage the “Letter” imposed on their reputations was paltry compared to the hurt Jim Crow inflicted on blacks and the danger Shuttlesworth and King courted every day to free them. In the context of King’s majestic efforts to “let justice flow,” the claim that King “did us an injustice” was insupportable.[^54]

By and large, the clergy did not grapple with King’s moral critique or retract their censure of his “extremism.” Even the gracious among them were too blinkered by their modest expectations of the possible, visceral discomfort with protest, and narrow benchmark of a more palatable mayor to appreciate the chasm between the ferocity of Southern racism and the folly of gradualism. They were asking blacks to be patient a full century after slavery, in the midst of a fierce Dixiecrat uprising; they were asking blacks to trust a courteous racist mayor who in three months would reassure George Wallace, “I’m still as strong for segregation as ever.”[^55] Their comfort with a glacial pace of change that consigned blacks to an open future of affliction was a moral failure as well as an error in tactical reckoning.

Reverend Abraham Woods, a Shuttlesworth ally, got it just right. In his generous appraisal, the white clergymen may have “wanted justice and equality, [but] they wanted it without plowing up the field. They wanted it without the thunder and lightning.”[^56]

In the weeks ahead, nothing that transpired refuted King’s critique of moderation or praise of creative tension. Instead, events validated key points of the “Letter”: the limits of moral appeal by itself to secure deliverance; the selfish immorality of privileged groups; the need for blacks to rely on themselves, even as they welcomed the aid of friends; and the power of the spectacle to galvanize the state to act on behalf of the suffering. Of course, King presented this in the context of a campaign of nonviolence. But it wasn’t just sympathy for noble, suffering victims that moved the nation. Violence and the white fear of black retaliation pushed events forward too. While that ran counter to King’s elemental faith, it was an extension of the “Letter’s” insistence, “Freedom is never voluntarily given up by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.”

The power brokers who really mattered in Birmingham were not the downtown merchants but the larger group of financial and business leaders on the Senior Citizens Committee. The assent of these very conservative Big Mules was needed to seal a deal of any sort, and Martin Luther King, Jr., was “poison” to them. They wouldn’t even sit down to negotiate seriously until they passed a specific threshold of pain. As late as the morning of the day on which the settlement was agreed to, their patience was running down, and they were ready for more draconian solutions. At the May 10 mass meeting, King’s cryptic “I got this from a source that I can’t reveal” indicated that he was privy to the details of a Senior Citizens Committee’s about-face. He seized his chance to let his black audience revel in their sense of power and to take a voyeuristic peek at the secret recesses of the mind of “dignified segregationists.”[^57]

“Don’t let anybody fool you,” King said. “They may try to say that they planned to do all of this anyway.” Actually, the negotiators “had ’bout given up … ’cause those business and professional leaders were sayin’, ‘We’re tired of these niggers, and there’s nothing to do but tell the government to send the National Guard here and get this thing under martial law … These niggers are just not gonna stop and we just can’t, we’re not goin’ to put up with it …’ And then they had the lunch hour.”

The meeting King alluded to took place on May 7, the day of the festival of black liberation. Using stealth and deception to avoid police detection, thousands of students—in King’s ebullient rendering in _Why We Can’t Wait_, “square blocks of Negroes, a veritable sea of black faces”—swarmed the downtown and inundated the white mandarins. “And when they got out for lunch”—King continued, his stuttery, down-home, singsong inflection full of bemused sarcasm—“and saw all those Negroes standing on the sidewalk singing ‘We shall overcome’ and they ‘Won’t let nobody turn me round,’ I heard that when they got back in there after the lunch hour, they started sayin’, ‘Now, let’s see, I think we could grant part one, and they moved down to part two and extended that.’”

With laughter sweeping through the church, King eased up a bit on the clowning. “Now I’m saying this in a humorous vein, but I’m very serious. Do not underestimate the power of this movement. And these things would not have been granted without your presenting your bodies and your lives before the dogs and tanks and the water hoses of this city.”

Indeed, the Big Mules wouldn’t have been in the room if Burke Marshall, the head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, had not been carrying out shuttle diplomacy between black and white leaders. Walker and Shuttlesworth were highly suspicious of President Kennedy’s motives in sending him, and King was “leery,” in David Garrow’s words, fearing “the Kennedy administration was interested not in winning greater racial justice, but in quieting racial trouble.” Despite his initial wariness, Andrew Young was won over by the laconic corporate lawyer whose constitutional scruples had kept the Justice Department from intervening in local Southern upheavals. “Burke deserves a lot of credit,” says Young today; Marshall’s personality was perfect for the task. He was quiet and modest, very unthreatening, “almost Southern,” a funny way of describing a son of Groton and Yale. “It wouldn’t have worked if he came in pushing the Alabama crackers around.”[^58]

As adept as he was, Marshall had help from others in Washington. The entire administration deployed considerable power to urge the Big Mules on. Cabinet members (from Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara), administration attorneys, and even the president himself got in on the act, calling connections ranging from Roger Blough, the head of U.S. Steel, to the heads of national chains like Sears and S. H. Kress, whose branch stores were targets of sit-ins in Birmingham. At an especially dicey point in the negotiations, one of the mules the president had leaned on spoke up and appears to have tipped things back toward settlement.[^59]

Kennedy’s dispatch of Marshall also vindicated the “Letter’s” insistence on heightening tension. At the May 10 mass meeting, King was as alert to the upheaval’s effect on the president as on the Big Mules. Earlier King had warned that he was too “hoarse to preach about it,” but as was typical after such warnings, he was soon preaching away on that very topic, the impact of the movement on U.S. foreign policy and the cold war. “When things started happening down here, Mr. Kennedy got disturbed. For Mr. Kennedy has to sit around tables of the world. And sometimes Mr. Khrushchev is on the other side. He is battling for the minds and the hearts of men in Asia and Africa. Some one billion men in the neutralist sector of the world. And they’re not gonna respect the United States of America if she deprives men and women of the basic rights of life because of the color of their skin. Mr. Kennedy knows this.”

The key moment, King explained, came when “the Associated Press got a picture of a dog biting a young man and that man didn’t have his hands out, and he didn’t have his hands up, and he didn’t have a knife in his hand and if you saw that picture, it was a boy standing with his arms down nonviolently and a dog biting him. And when that picture went all over Asia and Africa and England and France, Mr. Kennedy said, ‘Bobby, you better get your assistant down there and look into this matter. It’s a dangerous situation for our image abroad.’”[^60]

King’s account was not so far off the mark, although that picture of Walter Gadsden had aroused something in Kennedy beyond concerns about America’s image. Away from the glare of the press, he said that it “made him sick.” On May 4, the morning after Connor’s rampage, in the privacy of a meeting at the White House with leaders of the liberal Americans for Democratic Action, the president, frustrated by the apparent legal limits on his ability to act, decried the situation for blacks in Birmingham as “desperate” and “intolerable.” “I mean what law can you pass to do anything about police power in the community of Birmingham?” He conceded that “we have done not enough [on civil rights] … But we have shoved and pushed, and … there’s nothing my brother’s given more time to.”[^61]

Almost as if he was responding to the “Letter,” the president quaintly acknowledged that “if I were a Negro, I would be awfully sore” and reiterated, “I’m not saying anybody ought to be patient.” Validating King, he conceded the importance of disruption. “And this may be the only way these things come to a head. We’re going to end up with the National Guard in there and all sorts of trouble.” Kennedy went on to chide so-called liberal journalists who had been “telling me … ‘Isn’t it outrageous in Birmingham?’ and I said, ‘Why are you over there eating at the Metropolitan Club?,’” a genteel bastion of the privileged classes in Washington that was as welcoming to blacks as most of Birmingham’s white churches.

Later that month before a large crowd in Los Angeles, King’s approach to the president balanced disappointment, praise, and pressure. Kennedy, he noted, “has done some significant things in civil rights and I think he’s a man of genuine goodwill … But we’ve got to remind him that he isn’t doing enough.” King had an inspiration: Since on June 11 George Wallace was going to “present his body by standing in the door to preserve an evil system, then President Kennedy ought to go to Tuscaloosa and personally escort the students into the university with his body.” That, concluded King, “would be a magnificent witness.”[^62]

Kennedy never made that witness, but things were moving quickly under the rippling force of Birmingham. The unimaginable was being imagined. As soon as he returned to Washington from Alabama, Burke Marshall could see that “everybody’s mind was turned to the future and they thought this pattern of Birmingham had been established, that it would recur in many other places. And it did that summer. And the president wanted to know what he should do—not to deal with Birmingham, but to deal with what was clearly an explosion in the racial problem that could not, would not go away, that he had not only to face up to himself, but somehow bring the country to face up to and resolve. And during the week after that, that’s what he decided to do [on civil rights legislation].”[^63]

The content and rationale of what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964, banning discrimination in jobs, public accommodation, and housing, were decided just as quickly. Desperate for relief from the public clamor, Robert Kennedy headed out of town for a speaking engagement. The flight gave him and Marshall a chance to mull over the bill’s provisions and points of congressional contention. Could such a bill be constitutional? Kennedy demanded. As he later recounted to Anthony Lewis of the _New York Times_, Marshall replied, “I thought it could be justified under the Commerce Clause [rather than the Fourteenth Amendment].” Lewis broke in: “Commerce Clause even at that early moment?,” to which Marshall replied, “Yes. Right from the beginning, in my own mind. And so that was the end of it.” Said Kennedy, “Well, we’d better go see the President when we get back.”[^64]

The making of modern America into a full-fledged democracy emerged from a setback in Albany, Georgia, a theory of lawbreaking associated with an Indian seer, a redneck police chief who lost his composure, the grainy black-and-white image of a seemingly vicious dog, the mirthful truancy of students, a president’s frustration, and the legal instinct of a shy assistant attorney general. This was the grand sweep of history that the eight white clergymen who criticized King had trouble absorbing. None of it would have happened save for Shuttlesworth’s fervent faith and courage; if King and Abernathy had agreed to wait; or without the defiance of the black people who went into the streets of meanness.

Robert Kennedy later reflected: “President Kennedy said to the Negroes and to others—and, I think, quite accurately—the civil rights legislation should be called ‘Bull Connor’s Bill,’ … what Bull Connor did down there, with the dogs and the hoses and the pictures with the Negroes, is what created a feeling in the United States that more needed to be done. Until that time people were not worked up about it or concerned about it.”[^65]

None of this had kept the crisis at the University of Alabama from heading toward its denouement. Memories of the previous summer, when rioting whites had tried to prevent James Meredith from enrolling at the University of Mississippi and federal marshals had come under rifle attack from Klansmen, lingered. The Kennedy administration began to think apocalyptic thoughts. Many of its members had been reading Barbara Tuchman’s recently published _The Guns of August_, which chronicles how Europe slipped into World War I. Some began to wonder, Were they on the brink of sliding into another civil war, with federal troops occupying the South in a second Reconstruction?

George Wallace was the perfect trigger for such anxiety. “Wallace’s political psychology,” the journalist Marshall Frady wrote, “essentially derives from the Southern romance of an unvanquished and intransigent spirit in the face of utter, desolate defeat … the fact is, the Civil War is still quite alive to Wallace.” There was a moment in that war “which has for Wallace an almost religious meaning”: when Union troops seized a sick and starving Jefferson Davis, placed manacles on him, and he resisted against all odds, with all his might.[^66]

So Robert Kennedy went to Alabama to meet with Wallace, seeking to forestall another, possibly even greater racial conflagration. On April 25, five days after King left the Birmingham jail, the U.S. attorney general sat across from Wallace in the governor’s office. At some point, Frady observed, it began to dawn on Kennedy that he had entered a strange country. As he walked up the statehouse steps lined by state troopers (the same force that was only three weeks away from cracking Wyatt Tee Walker’s wife’s head with a rifle butt), one of them jabbed a nightstick into the attorney general’s belly.

Once inside, things were hardly less fantastic. Wallace let the chitchat linger with infinite tolerance for the excruciating awkwardness. A discombobulated Kennedy tried to establish that Wallace would comply with the court order to integrate the University of Alabama. The governor was not about to cooperate. Many of the arguments the governor and his adviser offered that day had the ring of less sophisticated versions of the eight white clergymen’s criticisms of King: “This whole effort is going to bring a breakdown between the races”; “But you might give ’em some _time_”; tell blacks “why can’t you be patient and hold off and let things evolve?”[^67]

Nor was Wallace’s opinion of King that far from the view of at least a number of the eight clergymen; they simply lacked his plebeian style and snarl. “But all this agitation and all this business of Martin Luther King—who’s a phony, and a fraud—marchin’ and goin’ to jail and all that, they just livin’ high on the hog—” Moreover, Wallace offered, “this Martin Luther King is doing things he shouldn’t do, and he’s advocating lawlessness.”[^68]

But Wallace’s pièce de résistance that day occurred when the suddenly affable governor glimpsed a solution for their mutual predicament. Since the Kennedys were considered “almost gods” by the NAACP and other civil rights groups, maybe the attorney general “could use the influence of the Justice Department to stop the integration movement.” In Frady’s words, “There was only a stunned silence from Kennedy.” Wallace continued: “Of course, I’m against integration at any time, but at least for the next ten years, at least.”[^69]

Determined to avoid a repeat of the Ole Miss crisis at the University of Alabama, on June 11 President Kennedy nationalized the Alabama National Guard, forced Wallace to step aside from the schoolhouse door, and the Guard escorted two black students onto campus. That night the president addressed the nation in the bravest speech of his presidency. After years of evasion and “handling,” of silence and reducing friction, Kennedy ratified civil rights as an American crisis requiring federal responsibility.

Despite its import, there was a helter-skelter quality to the speech. The president’s decision to talk to the nation was finalized only at the last moment; five minutes before Kennedy went on television, he was handed the unfinished draft that his speechwriter Theodore Sorensen had culled from the president’s dictation and various discussions. The president gave the final part of the speech extemporaneously. Most of Kennedy’s advisers and his Congress-savvy vice president, Lyndon Johnson, argued against his giving the speech at all. They especially balked at framing the affair as a moral matter. Righteous urgency on the race question would be a sign of personal commitment, which they feared would lead to electoral defeat in 1964.

Moral concerns alone had not brought the president to this point. “The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.” Kennedy did not hide his concern with the specter of violent, retaliatory blacks. “The fires of frustration and discord are burning in every city, North and South, where legal remedies are not at hand. Redress is sought in the streets, in demonstrations, parades, and protests which create tensions and threaten violence and threaten lives.”

If the president’s response seems grimly expedient, it offered clear evidence for King’s loftier argument that “tension” can provoke a moral awakening. For the first time, Kennedy exuded genuine public indignation that went beyond the inchoate sense that he would be “sore” if he were a Negro. Whatever the legalities, Kennedy indicated, “we are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.” He engaged in one of those Kingian flips: If a Negro “can’t enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place?” Continuing that same self-fashioning as a Negro and stepping into black shoes, he embraced King’s impatience, his unwillingness to “wait”: “Who among us would then be content with counsels of patience and delay?” He even echoed King’s critique of white silence and inaction: “Those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence. Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality.”

After all the times he had said now was not the time to press for civil rights, the president seemed to be borrowing from King: “Now the time has come for this Nation to fulfill its promise.” As King would two months later at the March on Washington, Kennedy reflected: “One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice … And this Nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free.”

Nor did he fail to grasp the pressure exerted by the language of American exceptionalism, even as in the process he tacitly validated the hypocrisy of it: “We preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, … but are we to say to the world, and … to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except Negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettos, no master race, except with respect to Negroes?”[^70]

In the final months of his life, Kennedy sometimes honored his stirring words more in the breach than in the deed. The relationship between King and both Kennedys retained elements of awkwardness and ambivalence. The president was skittish about endorsing the March on Washington, though he did and then worked to shape it so it would not jeopardize his congressional wrangling for the civil rights bill. After Kennedy’s death, in a dispute with Robert Kennedy, King was to answer: “But Mr. Attorney General, you have not been a black man in America for three hundred years.”[^71]

Still, Kennedy’s speech was a watershed moment that elated King and his coterie. The nation had reached a point of no return in the black stride toward freedom. Both versions of King’s gospel of freedom had spread far. The black one was evident in the aftershocks rippling out from Birmingham. In more than fifty cities, blacks were insisting that “we’re on the move now.” The other version of the gospel, the one that called on whites to help deliver the captives, was gathering force too. The result was an expanding coalition of conscience with heft that spanned blacks, white liberals, churches and synagogues, labor, and Hollywood.

One sign of the nation’s growing recognition of the urgency of civil rights was the growing recognition of the “Letter from Birmingham Jail” itself. During the summer, it began to break into better-known publications with broader readership. The _Christian Century_, the powerful voice of mainstream Protestantism, ran the entire “Letter” in its June 12 issue. In a “Comment on This Issue,” it observed, “We publish it … in the faith that it will help heal a most grievous wound which this nation is inflicting upon herself.” The version published by the _Atlantic Monthly_ in July was entitled “The Negro Is Your Brother.” Its title was virtually a command that blurred the boundaries between King’s viewpoint and the rising consensus of enlightened opinion.

The most tangible sign of this nationalization of race after Birmingham was a series of mammoth “great marches for freedom” outside the South that included Wrigley Field in Los Angeles in late May; the Great March on Detroit in June; and the March on Washington on August 28. The rising tide of white support did not sweep away the distinctive themes born out of the unique circumstances of Birmingham terror, the clergymen’s criticism, and the ordeal of jail. Throughout this halcyon, if transitory, moment of transracial alliance, King wove the arguments and language of the “Letter” into his speeches.

Blending elements of black resolve and beloved community, each was a confection of the basic units of King’s orations, sermons, and writings: “Now is the time,” “Let freedom ring,” “my country ’tis of thee,” “I have a dream,” “Free at last, free at last,” “people get tired,” “justice rolling down like waters, “wait means never,” and “every valley shall be exalted.” King recombined these strands of oratory in endless permutations, depending on the purpose, audience, and inspiration.

The Wrigley Field convocation set the mold. It came right at the two-week midpoint between the settlement in Birmingham and Kennedy’s speech. It drew white liberals and emissaries from organized labor and religious denominations of every stripe, topped off with a dollop of Hollywood celebrity. The heroes of the battle of Birmingham were striding onto a national stage.

The marquee speaker, King provided the rousing finish as he repeated arguments from both the “Letter” and the version he preached to a black audience. In a Pan-African equivalent of the chimes of freedom ringing from every mountaintop in America, King heard the same cry—“We want to be free”—emanating from Johannesburg and Nairobi as well as Birmingham. He raised that old charge—that the protests had been “ill-timed, why don’t you wait a while”—and rejected it:” But all of these years we have been cooling off and there is a danger that we will end up in a deep freeze.”

Despite the familiar themes, King’s aim was not to recapitulate the glory of Birmingham. It was to exploit its momentum to spread the black uprising in a steadily widening gyre. Ironically, in broadening the field of battle, King used one of the “Letter’s” key arguments to recast another. After thanking “our friends” on behalf of the people of Birmingam, King anticipated their question: “What can we in Los Angeles do to help?” It turned out you did not need to travel “beyond your hometown” like those prophets of old did. “The millions of white people of goodwill in this state and all over the country” could “help us in Birmingham, Alabama, by getting rid of any segregation and discrimination that exists in Los Angeles, California. For you see we must realize that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. And the de facto segregation of Los Angeles, California, is as bad as the de jure segregation of Birmingham, Alabama.”

King had a second request that stretched beyond the locale: He asked his listeners “to get over to the federal government that it has a great role to play in this period of transition, and I think the time has come … and Birmingham reveals it even more, for the president of the United States to sign an executive order declaring segregation unconstitutional on the basis of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of our United States.”

In the nurturing context of a cheering mixed crowd, a preacher’s crescendo supplanted the chill at the end of the “Letter.” King was ready to give the audience, many of them unfamiliar with the rites and rhythms of black preaching, the ultimate payoff of final rapture. Here was an exact parallel to soul music, the emergence of black culture into the national spotlight.

The climax of the black sermon offers a foretaste of the eternity to come. That is the force of “have seen” in “Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.” In transporting his white and black listeners to that realm of inspired prophecy, King was also giving them a foretaste of the coming of freedom that reassured them that their sacrifice now would be compensated later. “And if we will work hard and go out with a great faith, we will be able to carve a tunnel of hope through the mountain of despair. And all over this nation, all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to cry out from the hedges and the highways, the villages and the cities, Glory Hallelujah, Glory Hallelujah, his truth is marching on.”[^72]

A month later, at the Great March in Detroit, King delivered a version of “I Have a Dream.” The crowd had now grown to one hundred thousand. As in Los Angeles, the participation of white clergy bore witness to the “Letter’s” elegy to the prophetic mission of the church. At times the dreaming—that Negroes will be able to buy or rent a house wherever they could afford it—had a grittier material feel that befitted urban Detroit. But the sublime prophet appeared too, dreaming that every valley would be exalted and every hill and mountain would be made low. He closed with a crashing preview of his crescendo in Washington: “Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!”

The setting of the urban North, and the presence of Mahalia Jackson and Rev. C. L. Franklin on the dais, heightened the themes of black pride. Birmingham and the more than sixty communities that had started protests in its wake “reveal to us that the Negro has a new sense of dignity and a new sense of self respect.” There had been a vast upheaval deep in the Negro soul that seemed especially resonant in the city whose street corners and mosque gave Malcolm X a chance to try out his black nationalist evangelizing. As King put it, “the Negro can now unconsciously cry out with the eloquent poet”—and here he was invoking his favorite lines from the British abolitionist William Cowper: “Fleecy locks and black complexion / Cannot forfeit nature’s claim. / Skin may differ, but affection / Dwells in black and white the same.”[^73]

The capstone of the summer was the speech for which most Americans remember King, his delivery of “I Have a Dream” at the March on Washington on August 28. On the surface, the “Letter” and the “Dream” could not have differed more: the rebuke to white inertia on one side, the joyous refrain of brotherhood on the other; here the declaration of black independence, there the integrated throngs. Yet both were appeals to the larger white nation that laid out the rationales for freedom now.

An explicit elegy to racial self-sufficiency made no sense at a festival of interracial liberalism designed to secure white support for the Civil Rights Act. The political motive reigned supreme on an occasion fashioned carefully for its impact on Congress; that was why certain lines in John Lewis’s speech (“We will march through the South, through the heart of Dixie, the way Sherman did. We shall pursue our own ‘scorched earth’ policy and burn Jim Crow to the ground—nonviolently”[^74]) were censored at the last minute by the march’s organizing committee. In Washington, drawing on the soothing symbolism of the Founding Fathers, King invoked “the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.” In the “Letter,” he had insisted “we were here” _before_ Jefferson. Ensconced physically on the Mall at the Lincoln Memorial amid the nation’s sacred monuments, King positioned himself in the “symbolic shadow” of “a great American,” whose Emancipation Proclamation was “a great beacon light of hope,” and even channeled Lincoln with the language of “five score years ago.”

Midway through his speech, King swerved from his prepared remarks, which didn’t include the dream sequence. The shift may have been provoked by the call-and-shout of Mahalia Jackson, who cried out, “Tell them about the dream, Martin.”[^75] The emergence of the passionate preacher did not vanquish the patriotic imagery, which was fortified by King’s reference to “the American dream.” The millennial vision of “_all_ of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics,” joining hands and singing together comported with the most uplifting view of American exceptionalism. So did the musical anticipation of citizenship that came when blacks crossed over to join whites in singing “My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty.” This songfest echoed the unison achieved by the whole nation ringing the chimes of freedom together as blacks reconciled musically with the land that denied them their “inalienable rights.”

All that rapture was perhaps the most glorious statement of universalism in American cultural history. Even as the “Letter” sought to arouse conscience through shaming and chastisement, the “Dream” sought to appeal to the nation’s better angels.

Yet none of this swept aside the notes of prophetic judgment, black self-sufficiency, and veneration of an exiled people that King had articulated in the “Letter.” Despite the later mythologizing of a dreamy speech, the tough-minded King showed himself on the Mall. In the “Letter,” he had embraced “extremism.” In Washington, he reveled in “marvelous militance,” trumpeted “the fierce urgency of now,” and streamed into the passage from the preached version of the “Letter”: “Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.” King also included the implied threat from the “Letter”: “Those who hoped that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual … The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.”

King even reprised a version of the “Letter’s” confessional interlude (“When you have been humiliated …”) that gave white listeners a taste of what it meant to be black in America. But the purpose here was not to arouse pathos but to censure the nation and convey black resolve. He answered the question, “When will you be satisfied?” with a list of conditions: “We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality … as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities … as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ‘for whites only.’” The final condition—“No, no, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until ‘justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream’”—made explicit the prophetic judgment that suffused the “Dream” and the “Letter” alike.

King had signaled that judgment at the very start of the speech: “We come here to dramatize a shameful condition.” Even his efforts to speak from within the American tradition suggested the nation’s failing. Maybe the words of the Declaration and Constitution were “magnificent,” but they _were_ just words and just as mendacious as the “wait” that meant “never.” King seized on the language of the “architects of our republic.” Like “we were here” or “our beloved southland,” the “our” in “our republic” staked out a claim to black ownership. That claim was only enhanced when King immediately tinkered with Jefferson’s words and turned them into a rebuke: The architects had signed “a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men”—and here was the tinkering, borrowed from Frederick Douglass—“yes, black men as well as white men”—would be guaranteed the “unalienable rights” of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note …” In adding “yes, black men as well as white men,” King affirmed the Declaration by rewriting it.

The second half of “I Have a Dream” lacked this hard-boiled sensibility. Compared with the icy ending of the “Letter,” the “Dream” speech closed on a note of optimistic anticipation. Yet none of this dissipated the edge we encountered in the same blissful passages back in Birmingham in May, when King chanted, “Let freedom ring from every mountain” and blacks sang “My country ’tis of thee.” In both settings, the rapture was prophecy of a nation that did not yet exist. Each of his refrains, “I have a dream today,” was followed by the uncertainty of its future realization, “that one day …” King’s dream that “my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character” declared they did not live in such a nation yet.

In the preached version of the “Letter,” King had charged blacks in Birmingham with the task of “bringing that day” by working, protesting, and praying together. On the Mall, he briefly turned away from the nation to speak directly to those “veterans of creative suffering” who were trying to create that new nation. “I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations … fresh from narrow jail cells … Go back to Mississippi,” he urged them, “go back to Alabama” with their faith renewed. Once he finished listing the dreams, King made it clear that he would join them in the struggle required to make those dreams a reality: “This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day … when all of God’s children will be able to sing with new meaning, ‘My country ’tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing … From every mountainside, let freedom ring!’” All of God’s children were not able to sing that song yet: “And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.”

For decades, the sunny view of King as an exponent of the American dream has continued to cloud our grasp of the character of that speech and his relationship to the American experience. In the years ahead, as the white backlash spread to the North and white ethnics joined the resistance to black advancement, King sometimes observed in communion with fellow blacks: “We read on the Statue of Liberty that America is the mother of exiles.” Yet whites, he said, “never evinced the same maternal care and concern for its black exiles who were brought to this nation in chains.” On another occasion, he reflected: “And isn’t it the ultimate irony … that the Negro could sing in one of his sorrow songs, ‘Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.’” As the audience erupted in applause, King demanded, “What sense of estrangement, what sense of rejection, what sense of hurt could cause a people to use such a metaphor?”[^76]

That outsider’s positioning did not vanish from King’s address on the Mall that day. At the outset, he recalled the betrayal of the “Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.” The Emancipation Proclamation “came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.” But their joy was premature, their longing disappointed. “One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land.”

King nestled the entire speech between two spirituals. Before he spoke a single word, he summoned the voice of the ancestors. At King’s request, Mahalia Jackson introduced him by singing “I Been ’Buked and Scorned.” The slaves had the last word too. If blacks had ratified their claim on America by singing “my country ’tis of thee” with new meaning, King closed his oration by asking whites to sing the elegy to the gospel of freedom that had welled up in him when he was in Africa: “the words of the old Negro spiritual: ‘Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.’” For the moment, King turned whites into blacks so they could join the expansive “we” crying out, “we are free at last.” In the process they too could experience both bondage and liberation.[^77]

Before the American dream, there was the dream of the slaves. As King preached in the sermon “Unfulfilled Dreams,” “So many of our forebears used to sing about freedom. And they dreamed of the day that they would be able to get out of the bosom of slavery, the long night of injustice. And they used to sing little songs: ‘Nobody knows de trouble I seen, nobody knows but Jesus.’ They thought about a better day as they dreamed their dream. And they would say, ‘I’m so glad the trouble don’t last always. By and by, by and by, I’m going to lay down my heavy load.’”[^78]

[What Killed these Four Girls?](contents.html#ch04lev1sec4)

To “bring that day” of freedom would require many Birminghams around the nation. The raw violence and fresh martyrs of the next ones, including St. Augustine, Florida, in 1964 and Selma, Alabama, in 1965, quickly dispelled any sense that the road forward would be easy, ordained, or imminent.

It didn’t take long for King to descend back into the valley. On September 15, four little black girls died when the Klan bombed Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. This was the same church where the “old sisters” had set King to whooping; it was the sacred movement ground from which young protesters burst forth on Double D-day. The death of Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley—all of them done up in their Sunday finest—was a revenge killing for black transgression.

With blood dripping down his face, a small boy raced out of the church, crying, “Mama, where was God?”[^79]

In its own perverse way, the death of four innocent black girls confirmed many of King’s deepest beliefs: Evil was rife in the world; oppressors would not amiably relinquish their hold on privilege; plenty of “sick white brothers” roamed the nation. Two months later, right after he heard the news that John Kennedy had been assassinated, King grew quiet, according to Coretta King. “[F]inally he said, ‘This is what is going to happen to me.’”[^80]

The efforts of King and his colleagues to ignore death or mock it had already suffered a setback on June 12, the day after President Kennedy’s speech on race. A white supremacist assassinated their fellow freedom fighter and friend the Mississippi activist Medgar Evers in his own driveway. As Andrew Young recalled, “His murder brought home to us our own vulnerability. Our tendency had been to ignore danger, even in the midst of potentially violent confrontations. Medgar’s murder was one of many in the South that made us aware of how deeply the progress we had made had disturbed the racist psyche. We were now in uncharted psychological territory: never before had whites seen blacks as determined, as defiant as they were in 1963.”[^81]

A disturbance of the racist psyche well describes the malady of the bombers of Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. As Diane McWhorter documents so well, they formed a parade of sociopaths from the nether regions of the American proletariat: the mastermind, “Dynamite” Bob Chambliss, a onetime miner, member of a vigilante Klan squad the steel companies enlisted in the 1930s to smash the United Mine Workers, and Bull Connor’s “confidant inside the Klan” in the 1940s, “who begged cops to let him go with them to investigate ‘Negro disturbances’—‘You-all might need me along to kill a nigger’”; his henchman, an aerospace worker who liked to paint Catholic statuary black and sought to impress his girlfriend by running down a black man with his car; their colleague, the wife-beating truck driver with an eighth-grade education and no front teeth who had gained his explosives expertise in the marines and had smashed Fred Shuttlesworth.[^82]

The movement’s May victory, followed by the Birmingham City Council’s July repeal of segregation in public accommodations, intensified the distemper of that entire crew. The court-ordered integration of Birmingham’s public schools scheduled for September had diehard segregationists frothing over visions of mixed-race babies and the lascivious acts needed to produce them.

As the first day of school approached, the bombers were fiddling with fuses, staking out the church, and generally stewing at a world that had come undone. One crew member volunteered to “go to Fort McClellan and get a forty-five machine gun and step inside the door of the church and show you how to kill some niggers.” Less than a week before his bomb detonated, Chambliss complained to his niece, in McWhorter’s summary, that George Wallace was “a lily-livered coward—couldn’t even keep the ‘niggers’ out of the schools. ‘We got him elected and he’s not going to do what’s right.’” “You just wait till after Sunday morning,” he told his niece the day before the explosion at Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. “They will beg us to let them segregate.” Right after the explosion, Chambliss was spotted across from the church, savoring his handiwork.[^83]

These twisted characters possessed a savagery and zeal to act on it that were rare for the average Negrophobe, let alone the average racist. Yet dismissing them as evil idiosyncrasy may be too easy. Such guardians of racial purity had always operated at the sufferance of the government apparatus and the business community. A state investigator gave Bull Connor advance warning that the Gaston Motel was going to be dynamited in May. The Albany, Georgia, sheriff Laurie Pritchett also told Connor right before the motel bombing, “Bull, you got the Ku Klux Klan just over the mountain here holding a meeting. They’re going to blow King up.” According to Dan Carter, “Earlier that day, Connor had refused Police Chief Jamie Moore’s request to guard King (that ‘nigger son of a bitch’) and he was in no mood to listen to the Georgia policeman. ‘Let them blow him up … I ain’t going to protect him.’”[^84]

Complicity in racist terror extended to the highest reaches of the state. George Wallace pardoned the Klansmen who castrated Edward Aaron. He had enough clout with the Klan that he was able to abort its efforts during the integration of the University of Alabama with a simple command. In the summer of 1963, he enlisted the vicious anti-Semites in the National States’ Rights Party in a quixotic scheme to help block the integration of the Birmingham schools. In early September, he mused to the _New York Times_ that Alabama needed “a few first class funerals.” After the church bombing, King telegrammed Wallace: “The blood of our little children is on your hands.”[^85]

King pleaded for calm that week: “The old eye for an eye policy ends up leaving everybody blind.” Yet in the first flush of emotion after the bombing, some of the most fervent supporters of nonviolence found themselves drawn to the moral logic of the blood feud, with its clean reciprocity of a punishment given for one received. Killing the bombers or going after Wallace was the first instinct of James Bevel and his wife, Diane Nash. Once they calmed down a bit, they fashioned plans for a massive general strike that would shut down the state of Alabama. King vetoed that effort.[^86]

Adding Wallace to the list of the culpable didn’t exhaust the targets of blame. Hurrying back to Birmingham, King mused to Wyatt Walker that he and the movement would likely be faulted for the deaths of the girls. In their Good Friday statement, the eight clergymen had already reprimanded King for inciting “hatred and violence.” In a meeting with President Kennedy not long after the bombing, the genteel Episcopalian bishop George Murray was still blaming “both Governor Wallace and the civil rights demonstrators for fostering a climate of mistrust between blacks and whites.” Not all the attributions of blame were as easy to dismiss. The mother of one of the four girls, Alpha Robertson, insisted on a separate funeral for her daughter Carole. King rushed to her bedside and begged her to participate in the collective memorial, but she held her ground. She later told _Jet_ magazine, the black publication, “We realize Carole lost her life because of the movement, but we feel her loss was personal to us.”[^87]

As he did in the “Letter” when he refused to focus on the Klan at the expense of moderates, King did not stop at Wallace when he divvied up the blame. In a sign that his wounds from Birmingham remained raw, an angry King reproached “every Negro who refused to engage in creative protest.” A special bitterness infused his blast at “the apathy and complacency of the Negro business and professional individual who’s more concerned about his job than about freedom and justice.”[^88]

The dignified segregationist mayor Albert Boutwell did not show up for the funeral. Scoffing at reports that the mayor cried when he heard about the bombing, King accused him of shedding “crocodile tears.” But in an unprecedented act of integration, local black and white clergymen marched to the memorial together.

King faced a daunting task at the funeral. He fought to find some ray of hope in the shards of the explosion. Refusing to let racial terrorism stand as a random act of evil, King placed the tragedy in a larger drama of redemptive suffering in the service of deliverance: “These children—unoffending, innocent, and beautiful—were the victims of one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity … They are the martyred heroines of a holy crusade for freedom and human dignity.”[^89]

Executing one of his ventriloquist turns, King delegated to the girls the task of speaking the words of chastisement from both the “Letter” and the mass meetings: “[T]hey have something to say to every minister of the gospel who has remained silent behind the safe security of stained glass windows … to every politician who has fed his constituents with the stale bread of hatred and the spoiled meat of racism … to a federal government that has compromised with the undemocratic practices of Southern Dixiecrats and the blatant hypocrisy of right-wing Northern Republicans … to every Negro who has passively accepted the evil system of segregation.”

But what was the “something” the girls were trying to say? First, King divined, “we must be concerned not merely about who murdered them, but about the system … which produced the murderers.” The four girls were also urging us to “work passionately and unrelentingly for the realization of the American dream. And so my friends, they did not die in vain … The death of these little children may lead our whole Southland from the low road of man’s inhumanity to man to the high road of peace and brotherhood.”

King was coming perilously close to reducing the meaning of the girls’ lives to the political context of their demise, thereby exploiting their deaths and thus defiling them. As he moved toward the end of his remarks, King pulled back from memorializing the girls solely as movement martyrs. He sought to soothe their families with “Christianity’s affirmation that death is not the end. Death is not a blind alley that leads the human race into a state of nothingness, but an open door which leads man into life eternal.”

King closed with a gift of poetry to a grieving family and people. “And today, as I stand over the remains of these beautiful, darling girls, I paraphrase the words of Shakespeare: Good night, sweet princesses. Good night, those who symbolize a new day. And may the flight of angels take thee to thy eternal rest. God bless you.”

King had to struggle to arrive at that stance of grace. In what appears to be a fragment of a sermon dated a few days after the eulogy, his remarks included a darker poetry:

_The roar of the beast loud in the land._

_And the beast has struck_

_but he’s got the wild beast in his hand._

_And the avenging angel is on the wing_

_and the wind is blowing in from the sea._

These souls, King continued, “have been released by the striking beast. Weep not. Know the hour is dark and the way is hard; the beast will not escape from the hand of God.”[^90]

All the disappointments of the spring, all of the disappointments of the “Letter,” came flooding back at an SCLC convention at the end of September. Speaking to the same band of brothers one year earlier, King had vented some of his most forceful criticism of John Kennedy. Now King explained how he had looked to the president “for solace” after the bombing. He did not doubt that the president’s grief for the girls was genuine. When Kennedy called him and other Birmingham black leaders, King had reason to hope that some “lasting good” could come from the horror. In a telegram to the president after the bombing, King warned that without federal action “we shall see the worst racial holocaust this nation has ever seen.” Instead of action, Kennedy appointed a two-man commission, ineffectual emissaries to a community in need of protection and healing.[^91]

King’s “audacious faith” had been betrayed. He knew that he had bewildered many of his supporters by not demanding federal troops when it was open season on Birmingham blacks. “Over this fortnight,” said King, “I have been waiting … I have kept silence. I have exercised what I believe to be a tremendous restraint … I did this because I was naive to believe that the proof of good faith would emerge. It is now obvious to me that this was a mistake … It has become increasingly obvious as I look back and note that the Administration itself endorsed the pattern of segregation by having separate—and I wonder if they have been equal—meetings with the white and the colored leadership [of Birmingham].”[^92]

King’s distress underscores the chastening aftermath of Birmingham. The bombing was a portent of difficulties ahead and the challenges they posed to the “Letter’s” vision of nonviolent direct action. In the final four and one-half years of his ministry, there would be much to disturb and disappoint King. The roar of the beast of white backlash got louder. His adversary George Wallace leaped out of his Southern lair and burst into the Democratic presidential primaries in 1964, stoking the racial resentments of an aggrieved working class in Maryland, Indiana, and Wisconsin. These emerging racial conflicts were not identical to the Southern ones. King’s brand of sociodrama seemed better suited to the stark morality plays of Jim Crow than to class-tinged grievances about ghetto poverty, welfare dependency, and neighborhood stability.

The drift of black sentiment challenged the “Letter’s” vision too. In the years after Birmingham, white resistance and black alienation joined in a spiral of mutual recrimination. The idea of black power eclipsed King’s vision of transracial harmony. Rioters cried, “Burn, baby, burn,” and fires and snipers raged in Watts, Newark, and Detroit. In ghettos across the nation, King was mocked and rejected as an Uncle Tom.

As early as 1966 at a staff retreat, even some SCLC fieldworkers wondered aloud this unsettling thought: Maybe turning the other cheek was masochism more than nobility. “People are [getting] killed and we’ve done nothing about it!”; “White people are using nonviolence to exterminate black people!”; and “I’m not saying we should resort to violence … [but] we’re really carrying Negro people to their own death.” All this, remarked Rev. Joseph Lowery, was “hurting” to King. “When you hear the constant cries about ‘nonviolence doesn’t work,’ ‘the hell with these crackers,’ and ‘I ain’t turning the other cheek,’ you begin to wonder, you know, about the efficacy of what you’re doing.”[^93]

The Vietnam War exacerbated King’s upset about the place of nonviolence in the larger landscape. During a meal with Bernard Lee, one of his closest colleagues, King was leafing through a magazine when he came upon pictures of Vietnamese children, their flesh singed with the chemical napalm American planes had dropped on the Vietcong. As Lee described the occasion, “Martin just pushed the plate of food away … I looked up and said, ‘Doesn’t it taste any good?’ And he answered, ‘Nothing will ever taste any good for me until I do everything I can to end that war.’” In his 1967 “Beyond Vietnam” speech at Riverside Baptist Church, King resolved: “Somehow this madness must cease. We must stop now. I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam. I speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose culture is being subverted … I speak as a citizen of the world.”[^94]

In terms of the “Letter’s” long reach of empathy, this made perfect sense. Its universalism had never been just window dressing for the particular needs of black people. Moreover, King’s outspoken opposition to the war was the natural application of the “Letter’s” critique of moderates and standing on the sidelines. Blacks and whites alike savaged King’s pacifist turn. The former decried it as a distraction from “our people”; the latter decried it as a departure from “his people” (not to mention an act of treason). In response to withering editorials in the _Washington Post_ and the _New York Times_, King fumed in a telephone conversation with Stanley Levison: “The thing is I am to stay in my place and I am a Negro leader, and I should not stray from a position of moderation. I can’t do that.” King saw such criticism as a racist attempt to confine him to the apartheid universe of “black issues.” He also deemed it pure hypocrisy. “Oh, the press was so noble in its applause and so noble in its praise that I was saying be nonviolent toward Bull Connor.” The same people “will curse you and damn you when you say be nonviolent toward little brown Vietnamese children.” Did they not know, as King put it to Clarence Jones, that “I can’t equivocate when we’re bombing innocent women and children … you should know I’m a minister of God before I’m a civil rights leader”?[^95]

As the challenges to nonviolent direct action mounted in the final year of his life, King often sounded despondent. At times those closest to him felt he was trying to kindle hope in himself as much as in others. In March 1968, an outbreak of violence during a march for the striking Memphis sanitation workers sent him into a tailspin. “Maybe we just have to admit that the day of violence is here,” he said to Ralph Abernathy, “and maybe we have to just give up and let violence take its course. The nation won’t listen to our voice—maybe it’ll heed the voice of violence.” When Abernathy tried to comfort his weary friend, King replied, “Ralph, we live in a sick nation.” A few days later King envisioned all the other civil rights leaders’ saying, “Martin Luther King is dead. He’s finished. His nonviolence is nothing.”[^96]

Yet more telling than the vagaries of King’s mood was the constancy of his faith. Since 1963 he had been making the same transition in his public stance that he did in the “Letter”—from diplomat to prophet. His mood was darker, the allusions to philosophers were fewer, and the frankness had a raw quality. But it was the same truth telling that was the signature of the “Letter.” King had become a prophet unbound.

“We got to tell America the truth,” King declaimed in one mass meeting in the late 1960s. “Let me tell you … it’s a serious thing that America did to the black man.” Even after the Emancipation Proclamation said “we were free,” America “didn’t even give us any land to make that freedom meaningful. It was like putting a man in jail, and keeping him there for many years and discovering that he’s not guilty of the crime for which he was convicted. And then you just go up to him and say, ‘You are free,’ but you don’t give him any bus fare to get to town … Every code of jurisprudence would rise up against that. But this is exactly what America did to the black man.”[^97]

“Racism is very deep in this country,” he said. “Do you know that in America the white man sought to annihilate the Indian, literally to wipe him out, and he made a national policy that said in substance, the only good Indian is a dead Indian? Now a nation that got started like that has a lot of repentin’ to do.” His antiwar oratory acquired the same quality of jeremiad. “God didn’t call America to engage in a senseless, unjust war as the war in Vietnam. And we are criminals in that war … But God has a way of even putting nations in their place. The God that I worship has a way of saying ‘Don’t play with me’ … Be still and know that I’m God. And if you don’t stop your reckless course, I’ll rise up and break the backbone of your power.’”[^98]

Nor was King’s battle with disappointment a new development. Maybe the valleys seemed deeper, but he kept insisting, “Give me this mountain.” When had he not swung between the imagery of midnight and morning? Those tensions expressed a primal clash between realism and optimism at the center of his worldview. As we saw, the “Letter’s” confidence in eventual triumph was tough-minded; it brooked no illusions about the ability of the “oppressor race” to respond to “the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race.”

King’s optimism did not mainly rest on mundane appraisals of evidence and experience. Hope, he liked to preach, had an “in spite of” quality. It was rooted in the indisputable clarities of faith: My God is able; resurrection follows the crucifixion; you shall reap what you sow; after Egypt lies the Promised Land; the Lord will make a way out of no way; truth crushed to earth will rise again. King had been answering despondency with such assertions of hope from the start, in big campaigns like Selma and small towns like Demopolis, and especially in Memphis on the last night of his life.

King had hunkered down in his motel room in sickness and depression, but Abernathy summoned him to Mason Temple. As he made his way to the podium, thunder clapped and lightning crackled. Before long, he was taking everybody with him up the mountain, looking over at the Promised Land, and assuring the audience: “I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land.” The millennial ending of that speech closed with King’s glimpsing Canaan and “mine eyes have seen the coming of the Lord.” That was the sensuous side of prophecy, seeing the unseen.[^99]

But we need to recall what King observed before he stepped into the story of Exodus. He harkened back to 1958 in New York City when a mad black woman stabbed him and left a blade stuck in his chest. A doctor informed him that if he had sneezed, he would have died. King told the audience about a letter he had received from a white girl in White Plains, New York, who wrote, “Dear Dr. King, … I’m so happy that you didn’t sneeze.” Then he said to the Memphis crowd, “[And] I want to say tonight that I, too, am happy that I didn’t sneeze.”

If he had sneezed, King reflected, he “wouldn’t have been around here” for the sit-ins in 1960 or when “we decided to take a ride for freedom and ended segregation in interstate travel.” If he had sneezed, he would have missed Albany, Georgia, when Negroes decided to “straighten their backs up.” And “I wouldn’t have been here in 1963, when the black people of Birmingham, Alabama, aroused the conscience of this nation and brought into being the Civil Rights Bill.” Still, King was not done: If he had sneezed, he would have missed telling “America about a dream that I had had,” the great movement in Selma, and seeing Memphis “rally around those brothers and sisters who are suffering. I’m so happy that I didn’t sneeze.”

Throughout this recitation, King does not sound morbid or melancholy. He sounds like a man who knew death was stalking him and was preparing for the end. One senses satisfaction, maybe pride in the strides his people were making, in the fight they were engaged in. He did not even know what we know, the even-greater fruits that his labor would help bring in the decades ahead: the overthrow of Jim Crow, the erosion of the most brutal forms of racism, the making of a black middle class, the achievement of cultural pride and recognition, the growth of black political power, the election of the nation’s first black president, and the extension of rights and recognition to women, gays, children, prisoners, the mentally ill, the disabled, and immigrants.

All the things King would have missed if he had sneezed were not just proof that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. They were a testimony to what men and women can do to help in the bending. This is the ultimate meaning of both Birmingham and the “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” It is what oppressed people as well as the outsiders who come to help them can accomplish when they reject demands to “wait!,” forsake “appalling silence,” and become “transformed nonconformists.” It is a witness to people’s capacity “to bring that day” and thus to make the nation anew by praying, working, and protesting together.

King was fashioning an epitaph, not just for himself but for the larger endeavor to which he gave his life and for which he suffered death. In this reckoning, Birmingham had a special place. Never did it seem more luminous than on February 17, 1968, in a mass meeting in Montgomery, Alabama. He was back in the town where his life had taken a sudden swerve from its chosen path. The movement had seized hold of him and never let go.

There was a family feeling in the room, and King sounded happy as he spotted “Brother Marlow” and “Brother Palmer,” and there was Johnnie Carr, a friend of Rosa Parks’s and King’s successor as president of the Montgomery Improvement Association. “It’s good to be back home,” King told everybody. “It feels like the old times today.” There were important things on his mind, but he warned this audience that loved to hear him “hoop it up,” “I’m sorry I can’t preach about ’em ’cause I don’t have the voice. But I can at least talk about ’em.”[^100]

For a good part of his remarks, King displayed little confidence that the current cruelties of American life could be surmounted. Right-wing reaction was in such full force, King warned, dropping his voice to a near whisper. “And do you know what? A nation that put as many Japanese in a concentration camp as they did [in the United States during World War II]—you remember that—could put black people in concentration camps. And I’m not interested in being in any concentration camp. I been on a reservation too long now.”

Moments later, King veered sharply. Suddenly, the nightmarish state of affairs in 1968 faded. The Birmingham movement and everything it represented—the gospel of freedom it embodied, the colony of heaven that instigated it, the fire locked up inside the troops that fueled it—beckoned like a talisman of hope. Was that protest a historical precedent? Or had it become an archetypal event like Daniel in the lion’s den?

Any worries about not having “the voice to preach about it” dissolved in a surge of spirit. Falling into the cadence of preaching, King touched once more the spiritual fever that was at the core of the “Letter” and, beyond it, his very being. “I remember,” he began:

when we were in Birmingham.

And then we would just pour out

of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church

by the thousands

And Old Bull would say,

“Sic the dogs on ’em.”

And they sicced the dogs on us,

and we just kept on walkin’

and singing “Ain’t gonna let

nobody turn me around.”

And then Ol’ Bull would say

as we kept moving,

“Turn on the fire hoses,”

and they did turn ’em on.

But what they didn’t know

was that we had a fire

that no water could put out.

And we went on singing

in the midst of the water hoses,

“Over my head

I see freedom in the air.”

And then Bull would say,

“Pour ’em in the paddy wagon,”

And they threw us in,

and were sometimes stacked up in there

like sardines in cans.

But as the paddy wagon pulled away,

we were singing, “We shall overcome,

deep in my heart, I do believe!”[Epilogue](contents.html#epi)

### Words Spoken to Mankind]]

It took some time for the “Letter from Birmingham Jail” to emerge from the shadow of protest in Birmingham. But as the streets finally began to quiet, the “Letter” started its steady stride toward literary and moral coronation. The _New York Times Magazine_ had condensed the “Letter” for reprinting in late May, but canceled its publication when it discovered that the _New York Post_ was running an excerpt. As we have already seen, in the summer of 1963 the “Letter” continued its move from Quaker pamphlet and obscure journals into an array of secular and religious publications with larger circulations. These included not just the _Atlantic Monthly_ and the _Christian Century_, but also _Ebony_, the _Saturday Evening Post_, and the _San Francisco Chronicle_. In the run-up to the March on Washington in August, the American Friends Service Committee distributed hundreds of thousands of copies of the “Letter.”[^1]

The _Christian Century_’s editing reflected its keen grasp of King’s aims in the “Letter”: It removed the clergymen’s names when it printed the entire document. In accord with his larger purpose, depersonalizing the audience expanded King’s moral challenge to the nation. The preface not only hailed the “Letter” as the best expression of “the quality of mind and spirit” of the Southern integration movement but also added the journal’s imprimatur to the struggle itself. (It included an address to which its readers might “offer a tangible form of help.”) A flood of letters from readers sang the “Letter’s” praises. “What a shaking experience!” wrote one minister. “If the canon of the Holy Scriptures were not closed, I would nominate [it] either as a continuation of the Acts of the Apostles or as an addition to the Epistles in the best tradition of the Pauline prison letters.”[^2]

The “Letter” gained its largest audience as a chapter of King’s popular 1964 book, _Why We Can’t Wait_, the story of Birmingham that Harper published in June 1964. King sandwiched the epistle between chapters designed to win over sympathetic whites with reflective accounts of the black sojourn in America, Bull Connor’s Birmingham, and policy prescriptions. This blunted the indignant force and intimate feel of the “Letter” itself, reflecting a shift from furious truth telling to wooing. Yet the more placating feel of the book’s title did not dispel the message of militancy. King heralded the rising tide of black defiance and rejected tokenism as “a method for thwarting the Negro’s dreams and aspirations.”[^3]

Reactions to the book were unfailingly enthusiastic, a sign of realigning public opinion. New York Republican governor Nelson Rockefeller, who had opened one of his bank vaults on a weekend to give tens of thousands of dollars of cash for Clarence Jones to transport to Birmingham for bail, wrote King that the volume was “an incisive, eloquent book.” The title of the cover article in the _New York Times Sunday Book Review_, “To Lift the Siege of Denial,” accepted King’s verdict on the need for creative tension to force the nation to face up to the ugly truth of racism. The reviewer grasped that _Why We Can’t Wait_ was the continuation of insurgency and the “Letter” by other means: “The most effective message comes in those dramatic chapters in which the author relates the story of Bull Connor’s Birmingham and illustrates it with those brutal, obscene photographs that nearly the whole world saw, and seeing, turned away from in speechless shame and horror.”[^4]

In this swirl of acclaim, one small group conspicuously resisted the rush to praise: the people to whom King addressed the “Letter.” Decades later in his autobiography, Methodist bishop Nolan Harmon did not venture a single thought about the spiritual challenge of one of the twentieth century’s great moral documents. He did complain that he had been besmirched as “an utter recalcitrant,” an infamy heightened when the Methodist Board of Christian Social Concerns distributed the “Letter” to its members for spiritual reflection.

Harmon never wavered from his conviction that King and the protests “blew away brotherly race relations”—a barely refined version of the Dixie claim that “our Negroes are happy.” In a creative stab at Christian ethics, Harmon’s judgment that “agitation by the black people … was apt to bring antagonism and even retaliation from the new regime” held justice hostage to white reprisals. He never changed his view that blacks should have “let time smooth things out.” The rest of his response mixed distortion with dismissal: King’s position had been that “no time could be allowed for anything … all the demands of the downtrodden black people should be met at once.”[^5]

Rabbi Grafman remained a tortured soul where the “Letter” was concerned. During the six-hour funeral service after the bombing of Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, Grafman was inconsolable. Afterward, standing in his own pulpit on Rosh Hashanah, he said the Kaddish prayer of remembrance for each of the four girls. “I’m sick at heart,” he told the congregation. Perhaps because he had just relived the indignity of the “Letter”—King’s eulogy for the girls repeated its reproach of ministers who hid behind stained glass windows—the rabbi seemed to be still litigating the “Letter.” He deemed it “a vicious document.” Yet he also echoed King. Grafman called for the “nice people” at Temple Emanuel-El, including the sneering liberals he imagined in the pews, to end their “silence.” He had endured threats because he stepped forward to condemn George Wallace for being “bellicose.” “I want to know how many Jews sitting in this room have written a letter to the editor of the _Birmingham Post-Herald_ or the _News_. What’s the matter, haven’t you got the guts to do it?”[^6]

Grafman would feel forever fused in the minds of right-thinking people with “stumbling blocks” to freedom worse than the Klan. He never got over his hurt that New York Jews sent him letters likening him to the Gestapo enforcing Nazi laws. It took him two decades to own up publicly to his bitterness. “Now this letter is studied in English courses and sociology courses, and I get at least one letter a semester asking me if I’m still a bigot.” Yet that did not stop him from playing an important role in healing relations between blacks and whites in the emerging Birmingham. In truth, he had always had a large heart and an ecumenical scope and he played a leading role in raising funds to rebuild the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church.[^7]

Father Joseph Durick, the Catholic priest, underwent a profound awakening. He came to understand that King’s audience was broader than “my fellow clergymen and myself” and that King had been “gentle with us.” But “his soft words were painful to me. I had seen segregation as wrong but not as he had portrayed it.” The reforms of Pope John XXIII and his assertion that “racial discrimination can in no way be justified” fortified Durick’s resolve to spread the gospel of freedom. Promoted in December of 1963 to the position of coadjutor bishop of Nashville, he took it as his mission “to go out in the world and restore the dignity of man.” He urged Christians “to alleviate the afflictions and injustices of our times, to reconcile, to bind up wounds, to heal.”[^8]

In a turnabout that King would have loved, Durick retracted some of the words he had endorsed in “A Call for Unity” and spoke King’s in their place. As a bishop in Nashville in 1968, Durick joined a march in Memphis for the striking sanitation workers. Within days, King was dead. Durick’s pastoral letter calling for “a spirit of true love … to instill some reality into the dream [of King’s] promised land” was shared in churches across Tennessee. At one of the memorial masses, he read aloud from the “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” The passage he chose was King’s attack on white moderates as the “great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom.”[^9]

Fred Shuttlesworth never quite forgave King for not coming to the hospital when Shuttlesworth lay there in pain after a burst of water from the fire hoses sent him reeling against a building. He was also displeased that King had published the “Letter from Birmingham Jail” under his own name, despite an agreement between SCLC and ACMHR to issue statements collectively. But his resentment diminished over time. “My feeling was that the letter should have been jointly signed by all of us … It wouldn’t have taken anything for him to let me, but I guess as I look at it now … I think King deserves all the credit … He was the spokesman, and he was the one that God had chose to be the charismatic person for that age.”[^10]

Shuttlesworth’s verdict on his eight clergy critics, however, was not so gracious: they were Pharisees who were bound for hell. Jesus, he said, would have classified the whole lot of them as “bigots.” If that was not quite fair, at its core was this unassailable truth: “They never encouraged me. They never prayed for me as a minister or brother … They left me to the Klan.”[^11]

King’s closest colleagues stayed strong in the struggle, even as they adjusted to a post–civil rights world. Today, they see the “Letter” as a monumental work for the ages. Wyatt Tee Walker still fills up with pride in his role in producing the “Letter,” but it is the moral bite of the “Letter” that he feels captures the real contribution of their joint mission. Rev. C. T. Vivian goes further: King was not like a prophet; he _was_ a prophet, and the “Letter” was the utterance of a seer who was grappling with a question as enduring now as it was in 1963 that far transcended the question of black rights: “How do you reach a people without conscience?”[^12]

For Vivian, the section of the “Letter” in which King explains to the eight clergymen what it means to be black is key to grasping the core of the legacy not just of the document but also of the man who wrote it. It is where King puts aside Tillich and St. Augustine; as Vivian hears it, King is no longer “talking biblical talk for the sake of Christian talk. He is a person, a human, right?” He is “telling them the truth. They have ducked it. They don’t want to deal with it. People escape from their evil and you got to tell them. That’s what a preacher does if he really wants to convert them. That’s what the prophets did. Let them know what their evils were?”[^13]

King and the “Letter” gained more global recognition when he received the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. At the awards ceremony in Stockholm, Gunnar Jann, the chairman of the Nobel Committee, proclaimed, “King’s name will endure for the way in which he has waged his struggle, personifying in his conduct the words that were spoken to mankind: ‘Whoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also!’ ” Jann spoke out some of King’s words from the “Letter” for the witnessing world to hear: “Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts of men, willing to be co-workers with God.” “An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law.” “One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly.”[^14]

As the years went by, the applications of the “Letter” increasingly radiated out from the battlefield of American civil rights. It would be analyzed, appreciated, and applied within the nation and across the globe; in social movements, on divinity school blogs, and in anthologies of American literature. Bob Marley carried a copy of it on his 1973 American tour. It flourishes in the curricula of courses in peace studies and civil disobedience. Its eloquent aphorisms are among the most quoted in the world. The website Queeried offers “10 Lessons Martin Luther King’s Letter from Birmingham City Jail Can Teach the LGBT Community,” starting with “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere” and ending with “One day the South will recognize its real heroes.” Radical antiabortion militants have invoked the “Letter” and its call for violating laws that do not square with the moral law as a rationale for swarming abortion clinics.[^15]

The “Letter’s” prized place in high school and college curricula has provided its largest audience. From students in small liberal arts colleges and private school advanced placement classes to the children of struggling immigrants in community colleges, perhaps millions have read it. In a culture obsessed with personal achievement, countless readers have been stirred by its glimpse of a life worthier than one built around the self. Beyond this generality, they have read it in the way that all great works are read: after their own fashion. Some are moved by the power of its moral indignation, its refusal to accept what is manifestly unfair, its encouragement to speak up. Others respond to its ethic of care and invitation to empathy. There are those who find comfort in the hope it offers them as they face their own battles for justice.[^16]

It makes sense that the “Letter” and its vision spoke to African freedom fighters. They spotted the connection between Birmingham and their struggle for freedom as readily as King had glimpsed the connection between Birmingham and the birth of Ghana. The Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe, who venerated the “Letter,” observed that King “belonged to Africa in a very special sense.” Kwame Nkrumah’s children chanted from the “Letter” as though, in the words of historian Douglas Brinkley, “Dr. King’s text were a holy writ.”[^17]

At the end of 1962, King joined with Chief Albert Luthuli, the head of South Africa’s African National Congress, in “an appeal for action against Apartheid.” In his public statement “The Road to Freedom is Via the Cross,” Luthuli, who won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1960, anticipated King’s language in the “Letter”: “Laws and conditions that tend to debase human personality … must be relentlessly opposed in the spirit of defiance shown by St. Peter when he said to the rulers of his day: ‘Shall we obey God or man?’ ” In later decades, Bishop Desmond Tutu invoked the “Letter” in his sermons against apartheid, endorsing King’s assertion that nonviolence would vanquish oppressors in South Africa as handily as it did in India and Alabama. Tutu’s account of his work with the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, _No Future without Forgiveness_, exemplified King’s strictures against a vengeful or haughty victory.[^18]

Eastern Europe provided another circuit of connection. In the “Letter,” King had recognized the global applications of the ethic of care when he aligned himself with the 1956 Hungarian resistance against Soviet tanks and Communist suppression of religion. Responding not as outsiders heeding the call for help but as insiders justifying the breaking of oppressive laws, activists in the Solidarity movement in Poland, the Velvet Revolution and Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia, and the Pastor’s Movement in East Germany translated the “Letter from Birmingham Jail” into their respective languages.[^19]

The responses of insurgents to the “Letter” were no more uniform than the responses of student readers. The most specialized was the adoption of the form of a prison letter along with the moral argument. Defending nonviolence against “Jacobin guillotines and Bolshevik execution squads [that] never ceased their gruesome work” in the name of some ideal vision, Adam Michnik, the Polish dissident, channeled King in his “Letter from the Gdańsk Prison.” The Solidarity Movement, he wrote, was based on the premise “that there are causes worth suffering and dying for. Gandhi and King died for the same cause as the ‘Wujeck’ miners—who rejected the belief that it is better to remain a willing slave than to become a victim of murder.”[^20]

Argentinean activist Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, who spoke out against the brutal junta in the name of “the disappeared,” was not just inspired to establish Servicio Paz y Justicia, the human rights organization, by reading the “Letter.” It was through his experience of prison and torture, as a Japanese interviewer summarized their conversation, that Esquivel “acquired a keen personal understanding of the sentiments of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who said that the appalling silence of good people is as damaging as the hateful words and deeds of the bad.”[^21]

In other cases, the debt was less to the specific literary form or the prison experience than to substantive ideas or specific tactics of nonviolence. When Lech Walesa, the leader of the resistance to Communist rule in Poland and the nation’s first post-Communist president, came to address the United States Congress, he sent a delegation to Atlanta to thank Andrew Young for the inspiration and wisdom that Polish Solidarity had taken from the Birmingham movement. “One of the things they learned from us was to always give their opponent a face-saving way out of the confrontation,” Young recounted.[^22]

All Christians, Chief Lithuli, Bishop Tutu, and Lech Walesa were primed to respond to the ideals of sacrificial suffering and turning the other cheek. Mubarak Awad, the Palestinian-American activist who translated the “Letter” into Arabic in the early 1980s to teach nonviolent resistance for use against Israel on the West Bank, was also a Christian influenced by Quaker and Mennonite teachings. But the ideals of the “Letter” have rippled beyond that religious world to Tiananmen Square and Tahrir Square. Translations of the “Letter” abound on the web in Chinese. It appears in Farsi on Iranian pro-democracy websites. It is not clear if the Egyptian dissidents made use of the “Letter” during the Arab Spring but they did make use of the Fellowship of Reconciliation comic book, _The Montgomery Story_, which the American Islamic Congress translated into Arabic in 2008.[^23]

These ventures across borders of race, language, and religion took the “Letter” far from Birmingham and the black pain that provoked it. Its impact on Polish, South African, and Argentinean insurgents reflected the broad concern for mankind that was always part of King’s efforts to free his people. As King preached, “I have sheep who are not of my fold.” That was why in the “Letter” he placed Birmingham blacks in a larger community of all races fighting for freedom across the globe. He was convinced that Exodus repeated itself everywhere: There were always pharaohs to be vanquished and “extremists” to demand “Let my people go.” Ultimately, the enduring appeal of the “Letter,” with its declaration that “oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever,” is testimony to something at once simple and profound: King’s singular gift for giving words to the universal cry for justice.[Acknowledgments](contents.html#ack)

Anyone who takes on the challenge of writing about Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., accumulates large debts. I could not have written _Gospel of Freedom_ without the research of countless King scholars. Taylor Branch’s _Parting the Waters_, Clayborne Carson’s efforts at the King Papers project at Stanford University, and David Garrow’s _Bearing the Cross_ have been indispensable to all my work on King.

I have relied on three important books on the civil rights movement in Birmingham: Glenn T. Eskew’s _But For Birmingham_, Andrew Manis’s study of Fred Shuttlesworth, _A Fire You Can’t Put Out,_ and Diane McWhorter’s _Carry Me Home_. In addition, although Adam Fairclough’s _To Redeem the Soul of America_ has a broader focus than a single campaign, his chapter on Birmingham has been illuminating.

The book had its genesis in my own _The Word of the Lord Is upon Me: The Righteous Performance of Martin Luther King, Jr._ Although the “Letter” was not its main concern and I focused in that work more on King’s style and performance than on his substantive ideas, it was there that I first formulated my approach to King and to the “Letter.” It was also there that I discovered the importance of King’s speeches and sermons in black settings for understanding his “crossover” appeals to whites, both in writing and speaking. In this project, I have drawn in new ways on interviews, insights, and research, as well as on some of my takes on specific passages of the “Letter,” that were important to _The Word of the Lord Is Upon Me_.

Princeton University, and Princeton more broadly, has played a disproportionate role in this work and calls for special and various kinds of acknowledgment. When I was a Visitor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 2008–2009, I had just finished _The Word of the Lord Is Upon Me_, but I began to dwell on aspects of King’s substantive beliefs. Still, I thought I had said everything I had to say about the “Letter” until I received an invitation from the Princeton American Studies Department to give a lecture, cosponsored by the Department of African-American Studies, on King’s birthday in 2010. The more I thought about what I wanted to say, the more I kept returning to the “Letter,” and the more I kept seeing things that I had never really focused on after almost two decades of teaching and thinking about King. The result was “Pauline Epistle or Telling the Man?: The Slap of Translation in Martin Luther King’s ‘Letter from Birmingham Jail.’ ” I thank Hendrik Hartog, the chair, for the invitation. I also thank the students in the History Department Graduate Colloquium for their comments.

A 2011 fellowship at the Davis Center for Historical Studies in the Princeton Department of History provided financial support, time, and intellectual sustenance to push forward on my exploration of the “Letter,” as well as to complete some of the interviews for the _Gospel of Freedom_. I thank Paul Friedland, Doris Garraway, and Polly Jones, colleagues in the Fellows Seminar, for their comradeship and commentary. I also thank the participants in the Davis Seminar on Legitimacy and Authority for their criticism and questions, especially Jerome Adelman, Alison Isenberg, Kevin Kruse, and Sean Wilentz.

Daniel Rodgers, then the head of the Davis Center, requires mention that goes beyond his intellectual stewardship of the Davis Center and the special atmosphere he created there. Questions from Dan at critical moments helped me discover the book that was percolating below the surface of awareness, and then to define and frame the book. Later, he read a crude draft of the entire manuscript and once again his suggestions forced important additions and clarifications.

I cannot pay my debt to Princeton without mentioning Paul DiMaggio and Carol Mason: for good friendship over decades, conversation, food, and lodging during my stint in Princeton—and even the company of their cats when they were not about.

A Barnard sabbatical leave in the spring of 2012 and a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship for Independent Research in the fall of 2012 allowed me to complete the writing of _Gospel of Freedom_.

For things large and small, including insights, references, criticism, sources, encouragement, and much more, each in their own way, I thank David Chappell, Jim Davidson, David Garrow, Eddie Glaude, Michael Honey, David Kaiser, Mark Anthony Neal, and Diane McWhorter.

I have depended greatly on the archivists who make research like mine possible even as they keep alive collective memories of racial brutality and the efforts of the civil rights movements to bring democracy to America. I thank Edward G. Frank, Special Collections at the Ned R. McWherter Library of the University of Memphis; Jim Baggett, head of the Archives at the Birmingham Public Library, who got me oriented in the Bull Connor Papers Collection; and the staff at the Howard University Divinity School Library. I have benefited from the wonderful collection at the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, especially the recordings of the Birmingham mass meetings, and, above all, the generosity and knowledge of archivist Laura Caldwell Anderson. It felt like being back home at the King Center Library and Archives in Atlanta, thanks to the hospitality and help of Cynthia Patterson Lewis, Archives director, and Elaine Hall, archival assistant. As always, Steve Klein, the King Center’s communications director, was an affable and helpful presence.

This work owes much to interviews in 2005 and 2012 with Martin Luther King, Jr.’s close colleagues and SCLC associates. I am grateful for the time and wisdom they shared with me. I particularly thank Ms. Juanita Abernathy, Rev. Bernard Lafayette, Congressman John Lewis, Rev. Joseph Lowery, Andrew Marrisett, Rev. C. T. Vivian, Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, and Ambassador Andrew Young. I was honored to be in the presence of the people who embodied the “Letter’s” vision of “extremists for love,” many of whom welcomed me into their homes and their confidences.

Beyond the circle of King associates, I thank Rev. C. Herbert Oliver, who already in 1948 was fighting segregation and racism in Birmingham. He continued his brave work documenting racist violence in Birmingham in the 1950s and 1960s. I thank him for the recordings he made of the mass meetings and which he donated to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The insights, memories, and documents he shared with me have been vital to my understanding of what happened in Birmingham.

For joining in the larger fray to decide on the title, I thank Susan Malamed, Nancy Miller, and Roslyn Rosenberg. My son Daniel Ross-Rieder always holds me to the toughest standards of clarity and logic. My brother, Rem Rieder, provided his typically astute editorial suggestions. My literary agent, Susan Rabiner, not only weighed in adeptly on the title but was helpful in countless ways, not least of all in forcing me to figure out the kind of book that I wanted and needed to write. I thank the extraordinary group at Bloomsbury for their contributions—especially Michelle Blankenship in publicity and Nikki Baldauf in managing editorial. Peter Ginna, my editor there, contributed greatly to the manuscript with his literary grace, feel for the rhythm of pacing, and adept culling of the extraneous. I thank him profoundly.

The last debts are the largest. I cannot overstate the scope of the contributions of my wife, Catherine Ross, and my brother, Eric Rieder, to the _Gospel of Freedom_. I am very lucky to have two brilliant editors in my life. Their literary judgment and sheer stamina, intellectual rigor and brutal honesty have been vital to every phase of the writing of this book, from the most trivial to the most profound.[Footnotes](contents.html)

#### _Introduction_

**[^1]** All quotations from the “Letter from Birmingham Jail” are from the version that appeared in _Christian Century_ (June 12, 1963). You can also access that version at http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/letter-birmingham-jail]].

**[^2]** These CDs were converted from the original tape recordings that were made by Reverend C. Herbert Oliver, a pioneering civil rights activist in Birmingham, who donated them to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The recordings are especially important because writers have had to rely heavily on accounts of the meetings in the transcripts prepared by the Birmingham Police Department.

The reports provide important information. They open a window into the thinking of the white note-takers, whose accounts varied from primitive racist projection to flashes of aesthetic appreciation. Those white detectives “got the chance to experience a conspicuous version of racial tourism. Seated night after night in the rapturous churches, some of the monitors seemed transfixed by the loss of control of black women ‘screaming’ and ‘falling out.’ Apparently riled by criticism of Bull Connor, one detail opined that such criticism was a tool ‘to get a spontaneous reaction from the audience.’ They went on to speculate, ‘Apparently the only thing that held them under control was the absence of vines suspended from the ceiling.’ The detectives also took note of whites in the audience, such as ‘a beatnik type character, shabbily dressed, with long hair, ankle length boots, and long white socks.’

“Yet at least one policeman appeared to change over time into a connoisseur who occasionally hazarded critical appraisals of black performance, enlivening the voice of deadpan observation and racist voyeurism with the judgment that one speech by Rev. Charles Billups was ‘unimpressive.’ Some members of the unit even began to refer to their detail as ‘going to church,’ according to James Baggett, director of the Birmingham Public Library archives … The men’s own evangelical and Pentecostal style of worship, he points out, made some of them comfortable with the fervor of the meetings.” Jonathan Rieder, _The Word of the Lord Is Upon Me: The Righteous Performance of Martin Luther King, Jr._ (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2008), 270–71.

As valuable as the police reports may be, they have limitations beyond the obvious biases. The transcripts are often incomplete. At times, the white observers compressed and omitted the most important portions of oratory and commentary. The transcripts do not capture the tone and inflection, which are often important both in making sense of the speakers’ meaning, especially of subtext, and in gauging audience reaction.

**[^3]** Author’s interview with Andrew Young, January 31, 2012. For a more intensive discussion of the importance of King’s oral performance, his written work, and the relationship between his “black talk” and “white talk,” see Rieder, _The Word of the Lord Is Upon Me_. It was in that work that I developed the approach to understanding King that informs _Gospel of Freedom_ as well as many of my insights into the “Letter.”

**[^4]** The Acknowledgments list the most important of those chroniclers.

#### _Chapter One_

**[^1]** I do not spend much time in _Gospel of Freedom_ identifying the sources of language in each section of the “Letter” because my focus is on the substance of King’s argument. In addition, King adhered to a collage form of composition whether he was writing or preaching. He was always mixing and matching materials in inventive new syntheses. When he borrowed from a source, he adapted it to his own purposes, tweaked it in various ways, and made it his own. As a result, identifying a particular source does not tell you if King was borrowing directly from it, from someone else’s borrowing, or from his own previous adaptation of that source. An additional complication confronts those interested in the racial provenance of King’s sources. One might think that King is quoting from “white” sources when he invokes Keats or Carlyle, but how then to think of those instances when King is drawing from passages he absorbed from such racially proud black mentors as Benjamin Mays? In the end, King almost always gave sources his own distinctive signature.

Keith Miller is always interesting on the subject of King’s sources, and you can find a good discussion of some of the sources in the “Letter” in his “Letter from Jail,” chapter 8 of _Voice of Deliverance: The Language of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Its Sources_ (New York: Free Press, 1992). Given his special interest in the white liberal Protestant homileticians from whom King borrowed, he tends to underplay King’s quoting from his own mass meeting addresses to blacks. See also the exhaustive work of source-tracing in volume 6 of the King Papers, especially the discussion of the sermon “Transformed Nonconformist,” which will play an important part in chapter 3]] of _Gospel of_ _Freedom_. For some of the complexities and intricacies of King’s sources, especially the implications of his use of either black or white sources, see Rieder, _The Word of the Lord Is Upon Me_, especially 27–31, 91–109, 272–79, and 352–53 (note 17).

The most interesting differences involve passages that were deleted in the published version but that found their way into the “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” In either case, the phrases and arguments in both versions had long been part of King’s repertoire, used in his long-standing outreach to the white clergy.

He astutely analyzes the evolving strategy of SCLC in Birmingham and some of the confusions and mistakes in many standard accounts of the insurgency as well as in the retrospective constructions of the protagonists, including King.

The version in the _King Papers_ reminds you how much the force of King’s preaching often comes through even in his written work. That “coming through” obviously varies a good deal, depending on the particular work, the intended audience, and the process of editing and composition.

**[^14]** Author’s interview with Andrew Young, January 31, 2012; the quotes in this paragraph come from McWhorter, _Carry Me Home_, 384; on Grafman’s view of “merchants” as anti-Semitic, personal correspondence, Diane McWhorter, October 7, 2012. As the little hints in the tense exchanges of this meeting suggest, the three white clergymen differed a good deal in their understanding of race. Bishop Carpenter had long been in thrall to a neo-Confederate romance. Convinced that civil rights protests sundered happy relations between the races, he opposed _Brown v. Board of Education_ as fifty years premature. Bishop Murray had a more enlightened approach. After the city closed its parks rather than integrate them and his own upset children wanted to know why they couldn’t go on the rides at Kiddieland, he wondered what black parents might say to the same question. He gave his answer in a sermon during Holy Week in 1962: “Jesus truly offended in a little child!” Rabbi Grafman was in an especially tricky place. His moral reproval of segregation was undeniable. But he lived in a town where Asa Carter’s brigade prowled the streets with dynamite and decried “Kosher conspiracies” to mix the races. That did not stop Grafman from making some courageous stands for racial justice on more than one occasion.

For Shuttlesworth’s view of Carpenter, see Manis, _A Fire You Can’t Put Out_, 338; for Carpenter’s infinite time line for black freedom that apparently still qualified as meeting the bar of the “moderate” designation, see the interview with Carpenter in the CBS television special _Who Speaks for Birmingham?_; and for the continuing chronicle of Carpenter’s callousness that emerged during the Selma campaign in the conflict between him and an idealistic seminarian, Jonathan Daniels, see William J. Schneider, _American Martyr: The Jon Daniels Story_ (Harrisburg: Morehouse Publishing, 1992), especially the letters between the two men. The Murray sermon is cited in S. Jonathan Bass, _Blessed Are the Peacemakers: Martin Luther King Jr., Eight White Religious Leaders, and the “Letter from Birmingham Jail”_ (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2001), 51.

**[^53]** Stallings’s sermon is cited in Bass, _Blessed are the Peacemakers_, 215–16. The Stallings sermon echoed King in various ways. One day, King had hoped in the “Letter,” “the South would recognize its true heroes,” like Sister Pollard and James Meredith; here was Stallings: “Our day, our city, our Southland need men willing to pay the price to be moral and spiritual heroes who grapple with racial injustice.” How often had King dared his enemies, “Threaten our children and bomb our homes and send your hooded perpetrators of violence into our communities at the midnight hours and drag us out on some wayside road and beat us and leave us half dead … But be assured that we will wear you down by our capacity to suffer …” Here was Stallings: “Even if it means to be bound, even if it means to be spat upon, even if it means to be ignored, even if it means to be betrayed, even if it means to be rejected, yes even if it means to be crucified.”

**[^3]** A key editorial decision symbolized this shift from the “Letter’s” truth telling to wooing white supporters. As King advisers Clarence Jones and Stanley Levison worked on passages that included calls for policies to help poor whites, King explained to a freelance editor also working on _Why We Can’t Wait,_ “many white workers whose economic condition is not too far removed from the economic condition of his black brother, will find it difficult to accept a ‘Negro Bill of Rights’ [based on the concept of compensatory treatment], which seeks to give special consideration to the Negro.” Garrow, _Bearing the Cross_, 312.

Inevitably, the heavy imprint of a bevy of ghostwriters, editors, and advisers somewhat blunted the force of King’s natural voice. So did the touches of melodrama that began the book (“I see a young Negro boy … sitting on a stoop in front of vermin-infested apartment house in Harlem … I see a young Negro girl … sitting on the stoop of a rickety wooden one-family house in Birmingham … The boy in Harlem stood up.

April 16, 1963

MY DEAR FELLOW CLERGYMEN:

While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities “unwise and untimely.” Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.

I think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the view which argues against “outsiders coming in.” I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty-five affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently we share staff, educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct-action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here. I am here because I have organizational ties here.

But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their “thus saith the Lord” far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco-Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.

Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial “outside agitator” idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.

You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city’s white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.

In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self-purification; and direct action. We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the latter consistently refused to engage in good-faith negotiation.

Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham’s economic community. In the course of the negotiations, certain promises were made by the merchants—for example, to remove the stores’ humiliating racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others remained.

As in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self-purification. We began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: “Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?” “Are you able to endure the ordeal of jail?” We decided to schedule our direct-action program for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic-withdrawal program would be the by-product of direct action, we felt that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change.

Then it occurred to us that Birmingham’s mayoral election was coming up in March, and we speedily decided to postpone action until after election day. When we discovered that the Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene “Bull” Connor, had piled up enough votes to be in the run-off we decided again to postpone action until the day after the run-off so that the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues. Like many others, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, and to this end we endured postponement after postponement. Having aided in this community need, we felt that our direct-action program could be delayed no longer.

You may well ask: “Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn’t negotiation a better path?” You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word “tension.” I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.

The purpose of our direct-action program is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.

One of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. Some have asked: “Why didn’t you give the new city administration time to act?” The only answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before it will act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo. I have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.

We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was “well timed” in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word “Wait!” It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This “Wait” has almost always meant “Never.” We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that “justice too long delayed is justice denied.”

We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse-and-buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, “Wait.” But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can’t go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son who is asking: “Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?”; when you take a cross-country drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading “white” and “colored”; when your first name becomes “nigger,” your middle name becomes “boy” (however old you are) and your last name becomes “John,” and your wife and mother are never given the respected title “Mrs.”; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of “nobodiness”—then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.

You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court’s decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: “How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?” The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that “an unjust law is no law at all.”

Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an “I-it” relationship for an “I-thou” relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man’s tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.

Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is _difference_ made legal. By the same token, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is _sameness_ made legal.

Let me give another explanation. A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that state’s segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured?

Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.

I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.

Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience.

We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was “legal” and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was “illegal.” It was “illegal” to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler’s Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today I lived in a Communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country’s antireligious laws.

I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.

In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn’t this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn’t this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn’t this like condemning Jesus because his unique God-consciousness and never-ceasing devotion to God’s will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber.

I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: “All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.” Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.

You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained of self-respect and a sense of “somebodiness” that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation, the largest and best-known being Elijah Muhammad’s Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro’s frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible “devil.”

I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate neither the “do-nothingism” of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle.

If this philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as “rabble-rousers” and “outside agitators” those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black-nationalist ideologies—a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.

Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something without has reminded him that it can be gained. Consciously or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the _Zeitgeist_, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking place. The Negro has many pent-up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let him make prayer pilgr_resources/books//Gospel of Freedom_ Martin Luther King, Jr. - Jonathan Rieder to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides—and try to understand why he must do so. If his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to my people: “Get rid of your discontent.” Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now this approach is being termed extremist.

But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: “Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.” Was not Amos an extremist for justice: “Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.” Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: “I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.” Was not Martin Luther an extremist: “Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God.” And John Bunyan: “I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience.” And Abraham Lincoln: “This nation cannot survive half slave and half free.” And Thomas Jefferson: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal …” So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice? In that dramatic scene on Calvary’s hill three men were crucified. We must never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime—the crime of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.

I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still all too few in quantity, but they are big in quality. Some—such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle—have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach-infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as “dirty nigger-lovers.” Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful “action” antidotes to combat the disease of segregation.

Let me take note of my other major disappointment. I have been so greatly disappointed with the white church and its leadership. Of course, there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.

But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do not say this as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church. I say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall lengthen.

When I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be supported by the white church. I felt that the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be among our strongest allies. Instead, some have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained-glass windows.

In spite of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the channel through which our just grievances could reach the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand. But again I have been disappointed.

I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white ministers declare: “Follow this decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is your brother.” In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: “Those are social issues, with which the gospel has no real concern.” And I have watched many churches commit themselves to a completely other-worldly religion which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and the secular.

I have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi and all the other southern states. On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at the South’s beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines of her massive religious-education buildings. Over and over I have found myself asking: “What kind of people worship here? Who is their God? Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where were their voices of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of creative protest?”

Yes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church. But be assured that my tears have been tears of love. There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love. Yes, I love the church. How could I do otherwise? l am in the rather unique position of being the son, the grandson and the great-grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How we have blemished and scarred that body through social neglect and through fear of being nonconformists.

There was a time when the church was very powerful—in the time when the early Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was a thermostat that transformed the mores of society. Whenever the early Christians entered a town, the people in power became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians for being “disturbers of the peace” and “outside agitators” But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction that they were “a colony of heaven,” called to obey God rather than man. Small in number, they were big in commitment. They were too God-intoxicated to be “astronomically intimidated.” By their effort and example they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contests.

Things are different now. So often the contemporary church is a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So often it is an archdefender of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the church’s silent—and often even vocal—sanction of things as they are.

But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If today’s church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its authenticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. Every day I meet young people whose disappointment with the church has turned into outright disgust.

Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic. Is organized religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world? Perhaps I must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church, the church within the church, as the true _ekklesia_ and the hope of the world. But again I am thankful to God that some noble souls from the ranks of organized religion have broken loose from the paralyzing chains of conformity and joined us as active partners in the struggle for freedom. They have left their secure congregations and walked the streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They have gone down the highways of the South on tortuous rides for freedom. Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some have been dismissed from their churches, have lost the support of their bishops and fellow ministers. But they have acted in the faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the gospel in these troubled times. They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment.

I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are at present misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham, and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with America’s destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence across the pages of history, we were here. For more than two centuries our forebears labored in this country without wages; they made cotton king; they built the homes of their masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation—and yet out of a bottomless vitality they continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.

Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in your statement that has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping “order” and “preventing violence.” I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police department.

It is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they have conducted themselves rather “nonviolently” in public. But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends. Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany, Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. Eliot has said: “The last temptation is the greatest treason: To do the right deed for the wrong reason.”

I wish you had commended the Negro sit-inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation. One day the South will recognize its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, with the noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a seventy-two-year-old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride segregated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical profundity to one who inquired about her weariness: “My feets is tired, but my soul is at rest.” They will be the young high school and college students, the young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously and nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience’ sake. One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

Never before have I written so long a letter. I’m afraid it is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers?

If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me.

I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.

Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood,
