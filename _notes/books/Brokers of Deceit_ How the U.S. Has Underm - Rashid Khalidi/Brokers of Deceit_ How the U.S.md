Writing even a short book like this one demands a considerable measure of discipline and solitary concentration in the face of the insistent intrusions of daily life and its responsibilities and distractions. It also requires a great deal of help from others. I have benefited from such help from many people in various ways, whether this involved assistance in research, reading and commenting on drafts, offering suggestions, or simply picking up the slack during the many months when I was psychologically or physically absent, as I followed the twists and turns of the past thirty-five years of American policy on Palestine.

Ever since my involvement as an advisor to the Palestinian delegation that took part in the 1991–93 Madrid-Washington peace negotiations with Israel, I had harbored the desire to document and analyze as a historian some of the events in which I had been directly involved. Call it Ibn Khaldun envy: the great historian left us an account of his impressions of Timur (Tamerlane), whom he met when the Turco-Mongol conqueror and empire builder was besieging Damascus in 1401. Ibn Khaldun was uniquely placed to give us such an appreciation, given that he was both an eminent scholar and jurist and had been deeply and actively involved in senior positions in public life in North Africa, Andalus, and Egypt.[^1] None of us is Ibn Khaldun (not by a long shot!), and nothing I have experienced is on a par, although I have lived through the lengthy siege of a major Arab city—Beirut, in 1982. But I can understand well his motivation in seeking out this striking historical figure and recording his impressions of him in the midst of earthshaking events.

I had a particular incentive to record and assess a far less momentous and dramatic set of events, since I retained in paper and electronic form all of the extensive documentation I had acquired in the course of the 1991–93 negotiations, including many working documents I had helped produce. These internal materials of the Palestinian delegation, most of them unpublished and unavailable elsewhere, provided the basis for the second chapter of this book. They throw a unique light on the actual role and positions of the United States in these negotiations, as well as revealing much about Israeli diplomacy. I owe thanks to my astute and industrious fellow advisors and members of the official Palestinian delegation, whose dedicated work is represented in this collection of documents, including especially the late Faysal Husayni, as well as Su’ad al-‘Amiry, Hanan Ashrawi, Ahmad Samih Khalidi, Ghassan Khatib, Camille Mansour, Nabil Qassis, and Raja Shehadeh. Many of these individuals had at the time forebodings of the grim outcome of the endeavor we were all engaged in, notwithstanding our best efforts.

For a historian, especially one whose business for over four decades has involved analyzing and critiquing diplomatic and policy documents as part of my own research and writing, finally being able to utilize these unpublished and confidential materials as sources was an especially attractive proposition. Several works covering these negotiations have been published over the past two decades, and are mentioned in the footnotes. Some of them are quite perceptive, but none of them provided precisely the perspective I was contemplating, and none drew on this specific range of sources. In the past, however, an opportunity for me to offer my own reading of these documents and the events they reflected never arose.

The occasion to do so, and the trigger for me to reexamine and use these materials, came as a result of the research of Seth Anziska, a graduate student working on his doctoral dissertation under my supervision in the history department at Columbia University. While conducting research in the National Archives, Seth came upon a declassified American document from 1982 that I found extremely revealing of much that has happened since then between Americans, Palestinians, and Israelis. I cite this intelligence memo extensively in this book’s first chapter. I was fortunate to be given access to it and several other newly declassified documents that Seth found in the course of his own fascinating research into the Carter and Reagan administration’s Middle East policies. With his kind permission, I have gratefully used several of them, after he employed them in conference papers he has presented in a variety of venues.

In the course of my examination of these and other documents, I realized that they revealed significant underlying continuities in American policy on Palestine from the late 1970s and the early 1980s right down to the present. I noticed particular similarities to what transpired during the 1991–93 negotiations, with which I was extremely familiar due to my own involvement, as well as with the Obama administration’s performance on the Palestine question. These continuities, it was clear to me, are concealed behind the soporific repetition of a “peace process” mantra, and are obfuscated by superficial policy changes from one US administration and one Israeli government to another. This realization was the genesis of a short book that would focus on three moments during which these continuities were most apparent: 1978–82, 1991–93, and 2009–12, thereby taking advantage of the trove of documents in my possession and other sources available to me.

It is impossible to recall everyone who provided me assistance while I was working on this project, and I apologize to anyone whom I may have inadvertently failed to mention. I owe thanks first to Seth Anziska, whose archival discoveries not only helped set me on the path to this book, but also greatly deepened my understanding of a series of crucial junctures in Middle Eastern history and American Middle East policy. The full results of his examination of these and many other materials will be available to others when his dissertation is completed.

My assiduous research assistant, Sam Klug, has dug up for me primary materials on the policies of the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, covering the period subsequent to that treated in the documentary collection already in my possession. These came mainly from the Palestine Papers made available electronically by the _Guardian_ and al-Jazeera. His work was exemplary, especially for an undergraduate drafted to help me at the last minute. I also received useful tips, vital information and sources, help of various sorts, inspiration, and good advice from Bashir Abu-Manneh, Gil Anidjar, Kai Bird, Jason Brownlee, Rosie Bsheer, Victoria de Grazia, Alvaro de Soto, Graham Fuller, Raja Khalidi, Mahmood Mamdani, Camille Mansour, Jon Randal, George Salem, Naomi Wallace, and John Whitbeck. Special thanks go to my daughters Lamya and Dima, my niece Monette, and my son Ismail, all of whom helped in usual and unusual ways, as well as to the young Olympian, Tariq, who in his own unique way did his very best to keep his grandfather from obsessing too much about this book.

Among others who helped to bring this work to completion were Professor Henry Laurens, who by his kind invitation led me to present a series of four lectures at the Collège de France in March and April 2012, and with his comments, helped me measurably to shape the argument of this book. My thanks are due as well to the Collège for their warm hospitality while I was in Paris, and to the School of Arts and Sciences at Columbia University for its generous research support. Colleagues of mine at Columbia too numerous to mention listened tolerantly as I exposed to them various stages of my research, and many of them provided useful observations. Several people did me the kindness of carefully reading and commenting on parts of the book. They include notably Jim Chandler, whose acute suggestions and careful reading were invaluable in underlining linguistic aspects of my argument and often in showing me what I was really trying to say; Ahmad Khalidi, whose knowledgeable advice helped me to avoid many pitfalls and guided the manuscript in a much better direction at an early stage; and my toughest and most perceptive critic, the incomparable Mona, who provided invaluable feedback in more ways than I can count or thank her for, including especially a careful, expert reading of the third chapter, on Barack Obama.

In a class of its own is the team at Beacon Press, with whom it has again been a pleasure to work, including Tom Hallock, Pam MacColl, Susan Lumenello, and especially Helene Atwan, the best editor any author could ask for, whose astute readings very much improved the book. My constant changes of the title of this book (originally meant to be “Dishonest Broker,” until we found that that title was taken) and slippages in deadlines, were taken by them, as always, with good humor.

In spite of all this help, any remaining flaws or omissions in this book are entirely my own responsibility, and all opinions expressed in it are my own.

I dedicate this book to those who have tried in different ways over the decades to change the pernicious and short-sighted policies just described, which have been so harmful to so many, especially ordinary Palestinians. Far from bringing a just and lasting peace to the Palestinian people, to the Israelis, and to the Middle East, these policies have made realization of such a peace much more distant. And it is “peace” that is supposed to be the point, not “process.”

## INTRODUCTION

[^1]: .  On water issues in the West Bank, see Amira Hass, “Using Water as a Weapon in the West Bank,” _Haaretz_, August 1, 2012, http://www.haaretz.com/]]. For details on the siege of Gaza, see Mohammed Omer, “When the Lights Go Out, Talk,” Inter Press Service, August 2, 2012, http://www.ipsnews.net/]]. The infinitely expansive concept of “Israeli security” is a worthy topic in its own right, and has a lengthy colonial pedigree. Brutal actions ranging from the types of punitive measures described in the articles just cited to military operations such as the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, the 2006 attack on Lebanon, the 2008–9 assault on Gaza, the lethal boarding in 2010 of the humanitarian-aid ship _Mavi Marmara_, and the 2012 attack on Gaza are rationalized via a hermetically sealed train of reasoning whereby once such an action is determined to be necessary for Israel’s security, it is automatically seen as fully justified, and is carried out irrespective of legal and international norms. The mindset that makes this possible is discussed further below.

[^2]: .  Another trope, which sees Israel as “the only democracy in the Middle East,” is discussed in chapter II.

Excellent works on the current situation include Saree Makdisi, _Palestine Inside Out: An Everyday Occupation_ (New York: Norton, 2008); _Raja Shehadeh, Palestinian Walks: Forays into a Vanishing Landscape_ (New York: Scribner, 2008); Eyal Weizman, _Hollow Land: Israel’s Architecture of Occupation_ (London: Verso, 2007); and Idith Zertal and Akiva Eldar, _Lords of the Land: The War over Israel’s Settlements in the Occupied Territories, 1967–2007_ (New York: Nation Books, 2007).

See also Laura Eisenberg and Neil Caplan, _Negotiating Arab-Israeli Peace: Patterns, Problems, Possibilities_, 2nd ed. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2010). Both provide links to key documents available online, to which I will refer in these notes.

[^8]: .  In a speech to pro-Israel campaign donors in Jerusalem on July 29, 2012, Romney failed to mention the Israeli occupation as a factor in Palestinian economic backwardness, a point much commented on in the media, but best made, with typical irreverence, by _The Daily Show with Jon Stewart:_ “Democalypse 2012: National Geogaffe-ic—Romney Abroad,” July 31, 2012, http://www.thedailyshow.com/videos]].

[^9]: .  Israel’s occupation additionally largely explains the yawning gap between Israeli and Palestinian GDP per capita, a fact ignored by Romney in referring to this disparity in his July 2012 speech in Jerusalem, and much criticized even in the mainstream media. See Ashley Parker, “Romney Comments on Palestinians Draw Criticism,” _New York Times_, July 30, 2012, http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com]], and Scott Wilson, “In Israel, Romney Wows Crowds but Puzzles with Grasp of Palestinian Relationship,” _Washington Post_, July 31, 2012, http://www.washingtonpost.com/]].

[^11]: . The AP on September 2, 1982, reported that the Lebanese police had tallied 17,852 people killed and 30,203 wounded in Lebanon over ten weeks of fighting. Of these casualties, nearly 23,000 were Lebanese civilians, but the police noted that figures were not broken out for the high Palestinian civilian casualties, and that those buried in mass graves were not counted. Similar figures, derived from a later Lebanese police report, can be found in Rashid Khalidi, _Under Siege: PLO Decisionmaking during the 1982 War_ (New York: Columbia University Press, 1986), p. 22, n. 5.

I am grateful to Seth Anziska, who discovered this document in the National Archives. Fuller details can be found in chapter I.

[^14]: . John Mearsheimer and Steve Walt, _The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy_ (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2007), is the basic work on this lobby, although it lacks the historical depth of the late Peter Novick’s brilliant _The Holocaust in American Life_ (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1999), which is indispensable for understanding the role Israel has come to play in American Jewish life and in American politics since the 1960s. Also, as Noam Chomsky has argued convincingly in an interview in the _Journal of Palestine Studies_ 41, no. 3 (Spring 2012), Mearsheimer and Walt’s “realist” international-relations perspective does not recognize that US support for Israel is entirely compatible with many basic American corporate and strategic interests, rather than being mainly the result of the action of this lobby.

[^17]: . The statement declared that while the two “spoke at length about the threat from Iran,” with the president stressing that the United States would “prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon” and would pursue a policy of diplomacy “backed by unprecedented pressure, including the additional sanctions,” and that “all options are on the table,” they merely “also discussed a range of regional issues, including Middle East peace and the tragic situation in Syria.” “Readout of the President’s Meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu,” March 5, 2012, http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-and-releases]].

[^18]: . Jeff Halper, quoted in Frank Barat, “We’ve Gone Way beyond Apartheid,” Al-Jazeera, May 2, 2012, http://www.aljazeera.com/]].

[^19]: . This is confirmed by a later White House statement about a call from Obama to Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas, which mentions none of the previous points of contention between the United States and Israel, and seems to indicate that their conversation was restricted to pious generalities: “Readout of the President’s Call with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas,” March 19, 2012, http://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-and-releases]].

[^20]: . Quandt, _Peace Process_, p. 236.

[^21]: . This is detailed in Hisham Ahmed, “Roots of Denial: American Stand on Palestinian Self-Determination from the Balfour Declaration to World War II,” in _US Policy on Palestine: From Wilson to Clinton_, edited by Michael Suleiman (Normal, IL; Association of Arab-American University Graduates, 1995).

[^22]: . There has yet to be a searching historical treatment of these deep affinities along the lines of Novick’s _The Holocaust and American Life_. The American cultural historian Amy Kaplan is currently engaged in a study of American Zionism that promises to fill this gap. Noam Chomsky notes the shared American-Israeli “frontier” attitude to indigenous populations in the _Journal of Palestine Studies_ interview cited in note 14 above.

[^23]: . The United States had a major economic effect on Palestine in the decades before 1948: American contributions to aspects of the Zionist project totaled over $330 million by 1948, plus $55 million in investments. These were considerable sums in an economy whose average annual national income in the 1930s was around $75 million. See the table reproduced in Walid Khalidi, ed., _From Haven to Conquest: Readings in Zionism and the Palestine Problem until 1948_ (Washington, DC: Institute for Palestine Studies, 1987), pp. 850–52.

[^24]: . According to CIA figures: “Saudi Arabia,” _The World Factbook_, [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.htm  
l](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html\). These numbers are in dispute: other sources give Russia as the world’s largest oil producer, and Venezuela as having the world’s largest proven oil reserves.

[^25]: . Quoted in Irene Gendzier, “US Policy in Israel/Palestine, 1948: The Forgotten History,” _Middle East Policy_ 18, no. 1 (Spring 2011): 42–53.

[^26]: . Letter from President Roosevelt to King Ibn Sa‘ud, dated April 5, 1945, United States Department of State, _Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers_ (hereafter _FRUS_), 1945, vol. 8, _The Near East and Africa_ (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1945), and available online via the Avalon Project, Yale Law School, “The Middle East 1916–2001: A Documentary Record,” http://avalon.law.yale.edu/]]. The letter confirmed the US government’s commitment regarding Palestine “that no decision be taken with respect to the basic situation in that country without full consultation with both Arabs and Jews,” adding that the president “would take no action, in my capacity as Chief of the Executive Branch of this Government, which might prove hostile to the Arab people.”

[^27]: . During the seven years when Roosevelt was assistant secretary, the US Navy commissioned its first oil-powered battleships, the USS _Nevada_ and the USS _Oklahoma_, as part of a fleet-wide shift from coal to oil. For details on the enhanced perception of the strategic importance of oil as a result of the events of World War II, see Rashid Khalidi, _Sowing Crisis: The Cold War and American Dominance in the Middle East_ (Boston: Beacon, 2009), pp. 42–47.

[^28]: . The incident, which took place in the fall of 1945, is described in John Snetsinger, _Truman, the Jewish Vote, and the Creation of Israel_ (Palo Alto, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1974), pp. 19–21.

[^29]: . See Lawrence Davidson, “Truman the Politician and the Establishment of Israel,” _Journal of Palestine Studies_ 39, no. 4 (Summer 2010): 28–42. Michael Cohen, _Truman and Israel_ (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), comes to much the same conclusions.

[^30]: . Col. William Eddy, _FDR Meets Ibn Saud_ (Washington, DC: America-Mideast Educational and Training Services, 1954; repr. Vista, CA: Selwa Press, 2005), p. 31.

[^31]: . _FRUS, 1945_, vol. 8, _The Near East and Africa_, p. 17. Snetsinger, _Truman, the Jewish Vote_, p. 18, quotes Truman as saying much the same thing in a private letter in October 1945.

[^32]: . _FRUS, 1945_, vol. 8, _The Near East and Africa_, p. 10, n. 2.

[^33]: . In the end, the Democrats won handily when the Republican vote was split between two candidates. Nevertheless, Palestine was an issue in the election, as it has often been since then in New York City politics. An expert was quoted in the _New York Times_ of March 27, 2012, as saying of a recent political controversy over a Brooklyn co-op’s proposed boycott of Israeli products: “New York’s neighborhoods have their own foreign policy…. The boundaries of New York’s mayoral campaigns are infinite. Everything is potentially an issue.”

[^34]: . _FRUS, 1945_, vol. 8, _The Near East and Africa_, p. 17.

[^35]: . In his _Memoirs: Years of Trial and Hope, 1946–1952_ (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1955), vol. 2, p. 164, Truman explicitly stated of the permanent officials of the State Department that “there were some among them who were also inclined to be anti-Semitic.”

[^36]: . This is well documented in Cohen, _Truman and Israel_.

[^37]: . This tragic story is recounted in David Wyman, _The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust, 1941–1945_ (New York: Pantheon, 1984), and Deborah Lipstadt, _Beyond Belief: The American Press and the Coming of the Holocaust, 1933–1945_ (New York: Free Press, 1945). For an example of the pervasive anti-Semitism of one sector of American society in these years, academia, see the relevant passages of Peter Novick, _That Noble Dream: The ‘Objectivity Question’ and the American Historical Profession_ (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1988).

[^38]: . Truman in 1945 told his envoys to the Arab world “that if Palestine could only take some [Jewish] refugees from Europe to relieve the pressure … it might satisfy some of the demands of the ‘humanitarian’ Zionists.” _FRUS, 1945_, vol. 8, _The Near East and Africa_, p. 17. Even after the war it proved impossible to change US immigration laws to allow the entry of more Holocaust survivors. On this issue Zionists, who wanted them to go to Palestine, were in accord with those who opposed greater Jewish immigration for other reasons: see Cohen, _Truman and Israel_, and Snetsinger, _Truman, the Jewish Vote_.

[^39]: . This is borne out by Cohen, _Truman and Israel_, and by Snetsinger, _Truman, the Jewish Vote_, who document the influence on Truman of his domestic political advisors, especially Clifford, and discount the argument that the president was personally deeply sympathetic to Zionism.

[^40]: . Byrnes was deeply concerned with matters of war and peace, however, according to his own record of his government war duties and his role in postwar peace negotiations: _Speaking Frankly_ (New York: Harper, 1947). There is only one brief mention of Palestine in this book, p. 22, although more attention is devoted to the topic in Byrnes’s memoir, _All in One Lifetime_ (New York: Harper, 1958).

[^41]: . This is amply shown in Davidson, “Truman the Politician”; see also Snetsinger, _Truman, the Jewish Vote_; Gendzier, “U.S. Policy in Israel/Palestine”; and Fred Lawson, “The Truman Administration and the Palestinians,” in _US Policy on Palestine_, ed. Suleiman, pp. 59–80, and Cohen, _Truman and Israel_, pp. 149ff.

[^45]: . Henry Kissinger, _Years of Renewal_ (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1999), p. 373. This third volume of Kissinger’s memoirs provides eloquent testimony to the fact that for all the pain the embargo inflicted on the American consumer, Nixon and his secretary of state never allowed it to affect the close relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia: pp. 372–74. For further evidence, see the preceding volume of his memoirs, _Years of Upheaval_ (Boston: Little, Brown, 1982), pp. 974–76, where Kissinger notes that Crown Prince Fahd assured him that “the bilateral relationship with the United States had the top priority of the Saudis,” p. 975.

[^46]: . While he does not put it so bluntly, this is also how veteran establishment analyst John Campbell describes the Truman administration’s treatment of episodes from the 1947 partition resolution, through the 1948 Bernadotte Plan (which would have returned most Palestinian refugees to their homes and obliged Israel to give up some of the territory it seized during the 1948 war), and the abortive 1949 UN Conciliation Commission for Palestine, and afterwards, in “American Efforts for Peace,” in _The Elusive Peace in the Middle East_, edited by Malcolm Kerr (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1975), pp. 255–61. For a contrasting view, which underplays the weight of these domestic and electoral considerations, see Steven L. Spiegel, The _Other Arab-Israeli Conflict: Making America’s Middle East Policy, from Truman to Reagan_ (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985).

[^47]: . There is a large literature on this topic. For an excellent assessment, see Roger Louis and Roger Owen, eds., _Suez 1956: The Crisis and Its Consequences_ (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989).

[^55]: . Another element was involved: Kissinger often seemed more interested in turf battles with the State Department than in pursuing Middle East peace, as is visible in his handling of a 1973 Egyptian attempt to draw the United States into an active peacemaking role: Doc. 24, “Conversation between President Nixon and his National Security Advisor (Kissinger),” Washington, February 23, 1973, Nina Howland and Craig Daigle, eds., _FRUS, 1969–1976_, vol. 25, _Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1973_ (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 2011), pp. 67–68, where Nixon insists that Israel has to be less intransigent and Kissinger complains, “But the thing that kills us always in the Middle East is when State goes running like crazy without knowing where it is going.” Nixon was aware of this tendency and disapproved: “I don’t want any of this feeling of State fighting the White House” he told a State Department official in Kissinger’s presence: Doc. 49, “Conversation among President Nixon, his Advisor for National Security Affairs (Kissinger), and the Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs (Sisco),” Washington, April 13, 1973, ibid., p. 147. Nixon’s assessments of the Middle Eastern situation were often more acute than Kissinger’s: eight months before the start of the October War of 1973, a memo from Kissinger said that “it is difficult to argue that another few months delay in moving towards a negotiation would be disastrous for US interests.” Nixon accurately minuted: “I totally disagree. This thing is getting ready to blow.” Doc. 25, “Memorandum from the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs to President Nixon,” February 27, 1973, ibid., p. 70.

[^59]: . Nixon considered that Kissinger overdid this favoritism, as is shown by a 1973 remark (transcribed from the White House tapes) that he made to Alexander Haig in characteristically borderline anti-Semitic fashion: “Henry’s totally filibustered the Mideast for almost four years, too, because he is totally attacking what the Jewish agenda wants. Now, he really is. He really is…. I’m just saying, too, though, Henry has somewhat of a blind spot here, because he doesn’t want to do anything with the Israelis except reassure them and get them more arms. Well, now, the Israelis need a little restraint here, too, Al.” Doc. 6, “Conversation between President Nixon and Army Vice Chief of Staff (Haig),” Washington, January 23, 1973, _FRUS, 1969–1976_, vol. 25, _Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1973_, p. 8. Nixon’s bigotry was evenhanded. He told Kissinger: “They’re probably just, you know, the damned Arabs just talk.” Doc. 22, “Conversation between President Nixon and his Assistant for National Security Affairs (Kissinger),” Washington, February 21, 1973, ibid., p. 55.

[^60]: . Kissinger, and other American policymakers, saw this clearly from the very beginning of the process. Speaking of the first Sinai disengagement accord, he said, “The disengagement agreement, above all, would mark Egypt’s passage from reliance on the Soviet Union to partnership (in Sadat’s phrase) with the United States.” Kissinger, _Years of Upheaval_, p. 825.

The reasons no Palestinian state was created in 1948 also included, importantly, the incapacities of the Palestinian leadership and its inability to mount a serious state-building project during the Mandate period, as well as the weaknesses of, and divisions among, the Arab states, many of which had just obtained an often-still-nominal independence.

Benvenisti emphatically restated these conclusions in a recent interview in _Haaretz_ with Ari Shavit: “Jerusalem-Born Thinker Has a Message for Israelis: Stop Whining,” October 11, 2012, http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazi

[^66]: . A perfect example of how the situation in the occupied territories is concealed can be found in the Israeli government’s failed attempt to prevent CBS from screening a 60 _Minutes_ special on Palestinian Christians, which showed that their emigration was the result of hardships resulting from the occupation rather than Islamist persecution. This attempted censorship was admitted onscreen by Israeli ambassador Michael Oren. CBS was prevented from televising the segment during the Christmas season, however. See M. J. Rosenberg, “Suppression: The Israeli Government and 60 _Minutes_,” _Huffington Post_, April 26, 2012, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/]]. The dialogue between Oren and Bob Simon, the CBS presenter, excerpted in Rosenberg’s piece, is telling:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|_Simon:_|And it was a reason to call the president of—chairman of CBS News?|
|_Oren:_|Bob, I’m the ambassador of the State of Israel. I do that very, very infrequently as ambassador. It’s just—that’s an extraordinary move for me to complain about something. When I heard that you were going to do a story about Christians in the Holy Land and my assumption—and—and had, I believe, information about the nature of it, and it’s been confirmed by this interview today.|
|_Simon:_|Nothing’s been confirmed by the interview, Mr. Ambassador, because you don’t know what’s going to be put on air.|
|_Oren:_|Okay. I don’t. True.|
|_Simon:_|Mr. Ambassador, I’ve been doing this a long time. And I’ve received lots of reactions from just about everyone I’ve done stories about. But I’ve never gotten a reaction before from a story that hasn’t been broadcast yet.|
|_Oren:_|Well, there’s a first time for everything, Bob.|

Miller notes that the phrase was first mentioned in volume 2 of Kissinger’s memoirs, _Years of Upheaval_, p. 620, which states that to meet Israel’s expectations of unconditional American support of its negotiating position, the United States “would have to act in effect as Israel’s lawyer,” even while trying to achieve the contradictory aim of gaining Arab confidence.

## I  
The First Moment:  
Begin and Palestinian Autonomy in 1982

[^1]: .  Jimmy Carter was perhaps the most sympathetic of all US presidents toward Palestinian rights, but as we shall see he failed to make any significant progress in this regard while in office. He thereafter underwent a further evolution, writing _Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid_ (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2006), which showed his understanding of the need for a just resolution of the Palestine problem. The book aroused the ire of fervent supporters of Israel and the criticism of partisans of existing US policies on Palestine, but sold very well.

[^2]: .  Until 1992 the United States voted in the General Assembly in favor of annual resolutions on the Palestinian refugees “recalling” GA 194. In subsequent years, under the Clinton administration, it abstained, until 1998, when it joined Israel as the only state voting against the resolution, which it has continued to do since.

[^3]: .  See Charles Smith, “The United States and the 1967 War,” in _The 1967 Arab-Israeli War_, edited by Roger Louis and Avi Shlaim (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2012), pp. 185–88, and William Quandt, _Peace Process: American Diplomacy and the Arab-Israeli Conflict since 1967_, 3rd ed. (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 2005), pp. 44–47.

[^4]: .  The commitment made in the Israel–United States Memorandum of Understanding dated September 1, 1975, was replete with generous and costly promises to Israel: see Meron Medzini, _Israel’s Foreign Relations: Selected Documents, 1974–1977_, vol. 3 (Jerusalem: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1982), pp. 281–90, available at the website of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, “Foreign Relations: Historical Documents, 1974–77,” http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/]].

[^5]: .  As Yasser ‘Arafat pointed out in a 1978 interview with David Hirst of the _Guardian_ (“The PLO Position,” _Journal of Palestine Studies 7_, no. 3 [Spring 1978]: 171–74), “242 deals with refugees. We are not refugees. We are a people, the core of the whole problem.” http://www.jstor.org/stable/2536214]].

[^6]: .  Quandt, _Peace Process_, pp. 182–84. William Quant served on the National Security Council [NSC] during this period, and offers an illuminating analysis of Carter’s initiatives (pp. 177–91). See also the Brookings Institution Middle East Study Group’s 1975 report, _Towards Peace in the Middle East_ (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 1975), which called for Palestinian self-determination either in the form of a Palestinian state or “a Palestinian entity voluntarily federated with Jordan.” Two members of the study group, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Quandt himself, were later to play key roles in the Middle East policymaking of the Carter administration, in which other members of the Study Group served, including Sol Linowitz, Robert Bowie, Henry Owens, and Philip Klutznick.

[^7]: .  The linkages between advocates of an extreme anti-Soviet line and fervent supporters of Israel have yet to be fully explored. See John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, _The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy_ (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2007), for a discussion of aspects of this matter, and Anne Norton, _Leo Strauss and the Politics of American Empire_ (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2004), for an elegant analysis of some of the roots of neoconservatism and its fixation on Israel. See also Jacob Heilbrunn, _They Knew They Were Right: The Rise of the Neocons_ (New York: Doubleday, 2008).

[^8]: .  The Geneva conference had convened briefly in 1974 under American-Soviet joint sponsorship with the participation of a few of the parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict, but had quickly recessed and never reconvened. Quandt, _Peace Process_, pp. 187–89; the text of the American-Soviet joint communiqué is available on the website of the Brookings Institution; see Appendix D, http://www.brookings.edu/research/books/2005/peaceproc

[^10]: . Craig Daigle, _The Limits of Détente: The United States, the Soviet Union, and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1969–1973_ (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2012), pp. 23ff., shows that at the outset of his presidency, Nixon had the same inclination to involve the USSR in a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, initially via two-party US-Soviet talks, an effort that in the end was as fruitless as that of Carter, for some of the same reasons.

[^11]: . William Quandt, who was present during the negotiations, makes it clear in _Peace Process_, pp. 200–201, that it was the Egyptians, supported by the Americans, who pushed the hardest at Camp David for a better deal on the Palestinian track, although their stand was undermined by Sadat’s willingness to make concessions on this issue in order to secure what concerned him the most: land and sovereignty in the Sinai Peninsula.

[^13]: . Nor were the Palestinians mentioned per se in the Mandate for Palestine that the League of Nations granted to Great Britain. See Rashid Khalidi, _The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood_ (Boston: Beacon, 2006), pp. 32ff.

[^14]: . These ties began as liaison meetings with PLO security officials in Beirut for protection of the US Embassy, the American University of Beirut, and other US interests there, but expanded to include political contacts with midranking PLO officials, or prominent Palestinians close to the organization. Meant to be secret, they became known to the Israeli intelligence services. Andrew and Leslie Cockburn, _Dangerous Liaison: The Inside Story of the US-Israeli Covert Relationship_ (New York: Harper Collins, 1991), p. 334, suggest that Israel’s disapproval of even such a minimal American relationship with the PLO was a factor in its 1979 assassination of ‘Ali Hassan Salameh, also known as Abu Hassan. Salemeh was the senior PLO security officer involved in these contacts, whom the Cockburns call “a vital and independent CIA intelligence source.” This is also suggested by the then–US ambassador to Lebanon John Gunther Dean, in an oral history at the Carter Library: http:// www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/library/oralhistory/clohproject/Lebanon.pdf]].

[^15]: . Kissinger’s commitment to Israel not to “recognize or negotiate” with the PLO is mentioned in _Years of Renewal_ (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1999), p. 456. He notes (pp. 1041–42) that he had instructed the US ambassador to Lebanon, Dean Brown: “We want to get in some contact with the PLO.” Kissinger defensively insists that “we considered Lebanon a special case,” and that he had told President Ford, “We have no commitment to Israel not to talk to the PLO exclusively about the situation in Lebanon.” He disingenuously added that “lower-level security personnel may have had contacts with PLO functionaries … But there were no substantive exchanges.” This line is maintained by a later US ambassador to Lebanon, John Gunther Dean: “I had received authorization to meet with the PLO. I was given this authorization to take care of security matters and in defense of American interests.” Dean nonetheless later noted that the PLO helped him negotiate the release of American hostages in Tehran in 1979, clearly a matter unrelated to the security situation in Lebanon.

[^18]: . In fact, Vladimir Jabotinsky’s Revisionist movement, the ideological cradle of the Likud Party, which has dominated Israeli politics since 1977, had always claimed both banks of the Jordan, including Transjordan, as constituting the “Land of Israel,” based on the usual biblical ledgermain, and on a quaint construal of the League of Nations Mandate for Palestine. That this ideological plank had not been entirely abandoned as late as 1977 can be seen from the reference to the “Western Land of Israel” (i.e., Palestine) in the Likud party platform of that year, cited in the epigraph to this chapter.

Kissinger told Sisco: “Why shouldn’t we have done this with the Soviets and gotten something from the Soviets? … Why couldn’t we tell the Soviets to get their bases the hell out of there?” to which Sisco responded: “Assuming we get a peace settlement, there will be a general disinvolvement [sic] by the Soviets in the Middle East … Russian influence will go down with the Arabs as they become disenchanted—this is assuming we get a settlement.”

[^24]: . DDRS, “Summary of a meeting in Jerusalem between Secretary of State William Rogers, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir…” May 6, 1971, Document CK3100548322. Nixon repeatedly expressed frustration with the intransigence of the Israelis, noting, e.g., on a memo by Kissinger: “We are now Israel’s only major friend in the world. I have yet to see one iota of give on their part—conceding that Jordan and Egypt have not given enough on their side. This is the time to get moving—and they must be told that _firmly_.” Doc. 25, Memorandum from the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs (Kissinger) to President Nixon,” February 23, 1973, _FRUS, 1969–1976_, vol. 25, _Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1973_, p. 71. For more details on this 1971 episode and its sequels see Daigle, _The Limits of Détente_, pp. 168ff.

[^25]: . One of these efforts, in 1973, is well covered in a series of documents in _FRUS, 1969–1976_, vol. 25, _Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1973_ (notably nos. 22–29), which also show that the Egyptians were still smarting two years later from the failure of their 1971 effort.

I was present at a meeting in Beirut in the spring of 1975 when Yasser ‘Arafat and Salah Khalaf (Abu Iyyad) told a visiting foreign delegation that Sadat had told them before the war that he had misinformed the Syrians, saying: “The Syrians deceived us in 1967. Why should I not deceive them now?” This is confirmed in part by Abu Iyyad’s autobiography, with Eric Rouleau, _My Home, My Land: A Narrative of the Palestinian Struggle_ (New York: Times Books, 1981), pp. 121–26.

[^30]: . The convening of the Geneva conference and later proposals for a multilateral comprehensive forum for a resolution of the conflict were based on SC 338 of October 22, 1973, which called for implementation of 242 in all of its parts and for immediate negotiations “between the parties concerned _under appropriate auspices_ [author’s emphasis] aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East.” This wording was universally taken to mean a multilateral forum.

Named by his socialist parents for Eugene Debs (his brothers were Walt Whitman Rostow and Ralph Waldo Emerson Rostow), he served under Lyndon Johnson as undersecretary of state for political affairs (in which capacity he was instrumental in the drafting of SC 242), and ended his official career as the most senior Democrat in the Reagan administration by heading the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from 1981–83.

Details are in Rashid Khalidi, _Under Siege: PLO Decisionmaking during the 1982 War_ (New York: Columbia University Press, 1986), pp. 168–71 and 177. None of the US communications was on letterhead paper, or addressed to the PLO.

[^44]: . I witnessed this nighttime illumination, which at the time seemed inexplicable: I asked myself why the Israelis were firing star shells, used to illuminate a battlefield, when there was no fighting going on. This occurred after the Israeli cabinet had justified the occupation of the western part of the city, and the subsequent massacre, by falsely claiming that “about 2000 terrorists equipped with modern weapons remained in West Beirut, thus blatantly violating the departure agreement.” The cabinet statement was read by Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir to US envoy Morris Draper at a Jerusalem meeting attended by Sharon and other Israeli officials on September 17, 1982, at the height of the massacre. Seth Anziska cited this and other documents that he found in the Israel State Archives in a _New York Times_ op-ed article, “A Preventable Massacre,” September 16, 2012, http://www.nytimes.com]], which includes a link to the transcript of the cabinet meeting. The most comprehensive analysis of the massacre was undertaken by Bayan Nuwayhid al-Hout, _Sabra wa Shatila, Aylul 1982_ [Sabra and Shatila, September 1982] (Beirut: Institute for Palestine Studies, 2003), English translation, _Sabra and Shatila_, 1982, London: Pluto, 2004.

[^45]: . Asked later whether the United States had failed to keep its word to the PLO, and whether Israel had violated commitments it had made to him, US mediator Philip Habib responded forthrightly: “Of course.” Khalidi, _Under Siege_, p. 176.

[^46]: . In a January 28, 1982, meeting with Haig, Begin said of the legality of the settlements: “Mr. Ronald Reagan put an end to that debate. He said the settlements are not illegal. A double negative gives a positive result. In other words they are legal or legitimate…. Therefore the question of legality is finished so far as the United State and Israel is concerned. The President, Mr. Reagan, stated it clearly, for all times. The question whether it is an obstacle to peace, I think that we can prove it is not, by experience.” “Meeting between Committee on Autonomy, Chairman Dr. J. Burg, Minister of Interior and USA Secretary of State, Mr. Alexander Haig, Jan, 28, 1982, 8:10 AM, Cabinet Room, Government Secretariat, Prime Minister’s Office, Jerusalem,” Israel State Archives/Ministry of Foreign Affairs/6898/8, cited in Seth Anziska, “Autonomy.”

[^2]: .  This was SC 678 of November 29, 1991.

[^3]: .  Abu Iyyad, the PLO’s number two leader and chief of intelligence, for these and other reasons bitterly opposed the PLO’s support for Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. On January 14, 1991, just before the allied air war on Iraq began, he and two other PLO leaders were assassinated in Tunis by an agent of the Iraqi-backed Abu Nidal terrorist group, which his operatives had recently helped to cripple by sowing lethal dissension in its ranks: Patrick Seale, _Abu Nidal: A Gun for Hire_ (London: Hutcheson, 1992).

[^4]: .  Britain convened a conference on Palestine at St. James Palace in London in 1939 that was attended by representatives of several Arab countries, the Palestinians, and the Jewish Agency, but the two sides met separately with the British rather than with each other. The Geneva conference convened by Kissinger in December 1973 included only Israel, Egypt, and Jordan, under nominal American-Soviet cosponsorship.

[^5]: .  As mentioned in the previous chapter, President Nixon had contemplated such an approach involving the USSR at the outset of his presidency, leading to lengthy and fruitless two-party US-Soviet talks.

[^6]: .  For the text of the US-Soviet invitation, dated October 18, 1991, see Quandt, _Peace Process_, Appendix N, http://www.brookings.edu/research/books/2005/peaceprocess3]].

[^7]: .  The Letter of Assurances to the Palestinians, whence the epigraph to this chapter is taken, is cited in note 1, above.

[^8]: .  At the St. James Palace conference representatives of the Palestinians and the Jewish Agency were not on an equal footing, but in any case the two sides never negotiated with one another.

[^9]: .  I served as one of these advisors, as will be discussed below.

[^10]: . Indeed, in a letter setting out the conditions for the bilateral negotiations that were to begin in December 1991 in Washington, DC, Baker noted that “since the negotiations are likely to be held in US government buildings, access to these buildings will be available only to those declared as delegates. Other advisors and staff will not be permitted at the site of the negotiation.” Papers of the Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations (hereafter: PPD www.palestine-studies.org/ppd.aspx]]), Baker to all parties, November 22, 1991. The Americans only relaxed these rules after the Israeli attitude softened following the election of Rabin in 1992.

In a similar vein, Assistant Secretary of State Edward Djerejian stated during the same meeting: “We’re taking a concrete approach for the first time in US history to adhere to the 1967 principles. What more can you ask the US to do?”

[^33]: . Baker publicly criticized Israeli settlement activity, noting in congressional testimony on May 22, 1991, that “every time I have gone to Israel in connection with the peace process, on each of my four trips, I have been met with the announcement of new settlement activity,” and adding: “I don’t think that there is any bigger obstacle to peace than the settlement activity that continues not only unabated but at an enhanced pace.” _Journal of Palestine Studies_ 20, no. 4 (Summer 1991): 181–85. Baker took a harsher line with Israel than any American policymaker since, reaffirming that East Jerusalem was occupied territory, and chiding the Shamir government for its obstructionism, reciting the White House phone number before Congress on June 13, 1990, and telling the Israeli government, “When you are serious about peace, call us.”

[^45]: . These negotiators were surprised by how far-reaching the PLO-Israeli understandings were: they were told by the PLO that the Rabin government had in essence agreed to allow PLO forces into the occupied territories to serve as the core of the “strong police force” envisaged in the Declaration of Principles [DOP] that was drawn up soon afterwards in Oslo, and of whose details these negotiators were kept in the dark.

[^69]: . This conversation took place in my presence in 1992.

[^70]: . I have examined carefully the minutes of twenty-two meetings between American officials and Palestinian negotiators between October 1991 and June 1993, in many of which I participated, and a large number of other minutes from subsequent negotiations during the Clinton and Bush administrations, most of which are discussed in the following chapter. The pattern could not be clearer.

[^71]: . Speaking of Israeli-Egyptian negotiations, Nixon went on to say: “Now, we all know the Israelis are just impossible. I mean—we have two impossibles … and the Israelis have not given a goddamn inch.” The point was that the Israelis would not be budged, the United States had to accommodate them, and therefore the Arabs had to be deceived into thinking something was happening.

## III  
The Third Moment:  
Barack Obama and Palestine, 2009–12

[^1]: .  White House, “Remarks by President Obama in Address to the United Nations General Assembly,” press release, http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/21/remarks-presi  
dent-obama-address-united-nations-general-assembly]].

[^2]: .  It was apparently individuals like Sidney Blumenthal linked to the campaign of Hillary Clinton, to whom he was a “senior advisor,” who first injected some of these names into public discourse in an attempt to smear Obama. See Jacob Berezin, “Sidney Blumenthal Joins Hillary Campaign,” _Huffington Post_, November 19, 2007, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/]]. Such dirty tricks reportedly led White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel to deny him a job in the Obama administration: Peter Baker, “Emanuel Wields Power Freely, and Faces the Risks,” _New York Times_, August 15, 2009, http://www.nytimes.com/]].

[^3]: .  For example, the endlessly repeated claims that I “founded” or was a member of the board of a local Arab American 501(c)3 (to which the Woods Foundation, on whose board Obama sat, made grants) could easily have been shown false, had any of the many journalists who repeated this fabrication checked the group’s publicly available records. They would have seen that I never had anything to do with the group; but then a prime “incriminating” link between me and the later-president would have gone up in smoke.

[^4]: .  “An ‘Idiot Wind,’” _Washington Post_, editorial, October 31, 2008, http://www.washingtonpost.com/]].

[^5]: .  These accusations are seemingly endless: even the insertion of an Israel-friendly plank on Jerusalem in the Democratic platform at the national convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, in September 2012, supposedly at the personal instigation of the president, was not enough for some, such as David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush: David Frum, “Obama Committed on Jerusalem? Riiiiight,” _Daily Beast_, September 6, 2012, http://www.thedailybeast.com/]].

[^6]: .  To the eight years when George W. Bush was in office, one might add the first year and a half of the Reagan administration, when Alexander Haig was in charge of foreign policy. With the important exception of the 1982 Lebanon war, Reagan’s main policy impact on the Middle East was to consecrate and reinforce trends in dealing with the Palestinian issue that had been set down by his predecessors.

[^7]: .  Like those of previous presidents and their senior foreign policy aides, these materials are freely available via the White House and State Department websites and the press and other media.

[^8]: .  “Remarks of Illinois State Sen. Barack Obama Against Going to War with Iraq,” October 2, 2002, http://web.archive.org/web/20080130204029/]] http://www.barackobama.com/2002/10/02/remarks_of_illinois_state_sen. php]]. In this speech, Obama stated that he did not oppose all wars: “What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war.” He noted correctly that “even a successful war against Iraq will require a US occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences,” warning that it would strengthen recruitment for al-Qa’ida.

[^9]: .  Indeed, one of his rare public comments on Middle East problems aside from the Iraq war came in the same October 2002 antiwar speech, in which he criticized the oppression, suppression of dissent, corruption, inequality, and economic mismanagement fostered by “our so-called allies in the Middle East, the Saudis and the Egyptians.”

[^10]: . One can deduce a very limited amount regarding Obama’s private views on these subjects from articles based on interviews with people who knew him, such as the comprehensive reportage of Pauline Dubkin Yearwood in “Obama and the Jews,” _Chicago Jewish News_, October 24, 2008, http://www.chicagojewishnews.com/]]. She reports, accurately, that his views were not always apparent, even to those who knew him fairly well, adding that someone who was close to Obama, the outspoken and distinguished Chicago rabbi Arnold Wolf, noted: “He listened a lot but said very little. He’ll listen and listen and you don’t always know what he thinks.” Wolf found that on the Middle East Obama was “very cautious. Whenever we talked about issues, I would always be more radical than he.”

[^11]: . There are of course numerous exceptions even in the twentieth century, such as Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and George H. W. Bush.

[^12]: . For some, suspicious of Obama’s origins, his public statements will never be enough: they doubt his very place of birth and must look into his soul to ascertain his “real” views. They do so in remarkably inventive ways on the web and in the troglodyte precincts of the American right wing. However, this kind of conspiracy theorizing can only be taken seriously as a pathology to be studied.

[^13]: . Among the first such efforts are Fawaz Gerges, _Obama and the Middle East: The End of America’s Moment_? (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), and Zaki Laidi, _Limited Achievements: Obama’s Foreign Policy_ (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012).

[^14]: . Although I knew Obama for a number of years when we both lived in the Hyde Park neighborhood and taught at the University of Chicago, I moved to Columbia University in New York in mid-2003, and such contact as we had had was thereafter interrupted. When I left Chicago, Obama had not yet announced his candidacy for the US Senate, and thus _none_ of what follows draws on observations based on personal contact with him from that date onwards. Much has been written—most of it of little value—about Obama’s private views on Israel and Palestine, with the strong implication that these were his “real” views. However, it was already crystal clear by this point to anyone who knew him at all well that the man was an ambitious and savvy politician, not some sort of idealistic radical. Moreover, it should have been glaringly obvious to anyone who understood anything about American politics that if Obama had any hopes of being elected to higher office, the heavily stacked contours of the political terrain on the American national scene where Israel was concerned would play the major role in shaping his positions on these topics. That is precisely what has happened.

[^15]: . The Cairo and Istanbul speeches can be found at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-cairo-uni  
versity-6-04-09]] and http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-Of-President-Barack-Obama-At-Student-Roundtable-In-Istanbul]], respectively.

[^16]: . Peter Beinart argues in _The Crisis of Zionism_ (New York: Times Books, 2012), pp. 78–92, that Obama’s opinions on Middle East issues are rooted in a liberal Jewish outlook derived from figures who influenced him, like the late Rabbi Arnold Wolf. This may be true. However, this is still very much an Israel-centric vision (which in Rabbi Wolf’s case involved a deep and abiding commitment to justice). Yearwood, “Obama and the Jews,” quotes Wolf a few months before he died in late 2008 as expressing regret and a degree of fatalism about the Obama campaign’s embrace of political orthodoxy over Israel: “He knows more than most people do about the (Middle East) situation, but he’s going to go very cautiously and not do anything that shakes up the Jewish community. I’m not sure I agree with that, but that’s what’s going to happen.”

[^17]: . David Remnick wrote of Netanyahu’s outlook as it pertains to Iran in “The Vegetarian: A Notorious Spymaster Becomes a Dissident,” _New Yorker_, September 3, 2012, p. 26: “Netanyahu also provides a historical dimension to his reluctance to rely on American promises. At a speech to AIPAC, in Washington, last March, he recounted how, in 1944, the US War Department spurned a plea from the World Jewish Congress to bomb the death camps at Auschwitz. ‘Never again will we not be masters of the fate of our very survival,’ he said. ‘We deeply appreciate the great alliance between our two countries. But when it comes to Israel’s survival we must always remain the masters of our fate.’” Andrew Sullivan links Netanyahu’s worldview to his hero worship of his father, the scholar and extremist Ben-Zion Netanyahu, who was a close associate of Vladimir Jabotinsky, spiritual father of the radical right-wing Revisionist Zionism of which Begin, Shamir, and now the younger Netanyahu are the heirs: Andrew Sullivan, “Why Continue to Build the Settlements?” _Daily Beast_, March 30, 2012, http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/]].

[^18]: . Obama’s earliest political mentors in Chicago included Abner Mikva, Newton Minow, Marilyn Katz, Bettylu Saltzman (the daughter of Philip Klutznick, who was a leading figure in the American Jewish community), and Rabbi Arnold Wolf, all of whom were broadly liberal or progressive in their views, and generally moderate in their outlook on Israel. Thereafter, as he became more involved in electoral politics, his financial backers included Chicagoans Lester Crown, former president and chair of General Dynamics, several members of the Pritzker family, owners of the Hyatt hotel chain, and another neighbor, Alan Solow, later head of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. All were major financial backers of Israel. Once launched on the national stage, Obama developed a far broader base of donors and backers, but many of them were as committed to vigorous support of Israel as was the latter group.

Indeed, the author notes (p. 10), “As an American, it was impossible to miss the breathtaking ambition of the Israeli officer corps to lead, instead of follow, US policy in the Middle East.”

[^21]: . It was not some wild-eyed conspiracy theorist, but rather Ehud Barak, former Israeli chief of staff and prime minister and current defense minister, who in an interview with the Israeli newspaper _Yediot Aharonot_ on May 2, 2008, said: “We entered into Lebanon … [and] Hizballah was created as a result of our stay there.” Israeli scholars and journalists have amply documented the encouragement that the Israeli domestic intelligence service, the General Security Service, or Shabak, gave to Hamas at its inception: see Shaul Mishal and Avraham Sela, _The Palestinian Hamas: Vision, Violence, and Coexistence_ (New York: Columbia University Press, 1990). See also Richard Sale, “Israel Gave Major Aid to Hamas,” UPI, February 24, 2001.

[^27]: . In a video message of less than a minute and a half that Obama sent to the June 2012 national conference of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the president never even mentioned Palestine. The ADC is perhaps the largest Arab American group. “President Barack Obama’s Address at the 2012 ADC National Convention,” http://www.youtube.com/]].

[^28]: . In his brief time as a US senator, Obama cosponsored S. 2370, the “Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006,” threatening a cutoff of US aid if Hamas were included in the PA, S. 534 of 2006, “Condemning Hezbollah and Hamas and their state sponsors and supporting Israel’s right to self-defense,” and S. 522 of 2008, “Recognizing the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern state of Israel and reaffirming the close bonds between the United States and Israel.”

[^29]: . Months before the 1973 war, Nixon noted that CIA director Richard Helms had assured him that Israel “could lick any and all of their enemies, provided the Soviet stays out, for five years without any more planes, because their, he says [sic], the advantage is enormous.” Doc. 32, “Conversation between President Nixon and his National Security Advisor (Kissinger)” Washington, February 28, 1973. _FRUS, 1969–1976_, vol. 25, _Arab-Israeli Crisis and War_, 1973, pp. 100–101. A later CIA director, James Schlesinger, put it in this understated way: “It has never been characteristic of Israeli officials to understate the dangers facing Israel.” Doc. 50, “Memorandum from Director of Central Intelligence Schlesinger to the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs,” Washington, April 16, 1973, _FRUS, 1969–1976, vol. 25, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1973_, p. 150. For a recent study that discusses American estimations of the situation before the 1967 war see Charles Smith, “The United States and the 1967 War,” in _The 1967 Arab-Israeli War_, edited by Roger Louis and Avi Shlaim (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2012). In an address to the National Defense College on August 8, 1982, then prime minister Begin reviewed all of Israel’s wars, concluding correctly that several were “wars of choice” (for which one might substitute “wars of aggression”) and made it clear that in 1967 Israel was in no danger of extermination: “In June 1967 we again had a choice. The Egyptian army concentrations in the Sinai approaches do not prove that Nasser was really about to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him.” Begin was of course trying to justify the 1982 “war of choice” he had just launched against Lebanon. “Address to Prime Minister Begin at the National Defense College, 8 August 1982,” available at the website of Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, “Foreign Relations: Historical Documents, 1982–84,” http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/]].

[^30]: . In response to yet another round of saber-rattling by Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu about the imminence of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons in August 2012, American officials calmly reiterated that “the U.S. intelligence assessment remains that the Islamic Republic is undecided on whether to build a bomb and is years away from any such nuclear capability.” Dan Williams, “All Threats ‘Dwarfed’ by Iran Nuclear Work: Israel PM,” Reuters, August 12, 2012 http://www.reuters.com/]].

[^31]: . In the words of perhaps the most astute American expert on these matters, Gary Sick, senior NSC specialist on Iran in two administrations: “Over the past two years, as the veiled threats of an attack became ever more shrill, virtually the entire Israeli security establishment came out in opposition to such an operation.” In “Please Exhale, Israel Is Not Going to Attack Iran,” _Gary’s Choices_, blog entry by Gary Sick, August 14, 2012, http://garysick.tumblr.com/]].

[^32]: . Goldberg wrote about his experience in the Israeli Defense Forces in his book, _Prisoners: A Story of Friendship and Terror_ (New York: Knopf, 2006). In the estimation of _New York Magazine_ writer Jason Zengerle, “When it comes to the topic of Israel, Goldberg is currently the most important Jewish journalist in the United States. He is the favored interlocutor for both Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu; the leaders, as well as their advisers, seem to do much of their talking to one another through interviews with him. One White House aide likes to describe Goldberg as the ‘official therapist’ of the US-Israel relationship. And among Jewish journalists who write and think about Israel, he’s become something of a referee.” “The Israeli Desert,” _New York Magazine_, June 3, 2012, http://nymag.com/]].

[^36]: . Obama speech to AIPAC, March 4, 2012.

[^37]: . Goldberg, “Obama to Iran and Israel.” The Goldstone Report was issued by the UN Human Rights Council in the wake of the Israeli attack on Gaza in December 2008–January 2009. The _Mavi Marmara_ was part of a humanitarian flotilla attempting to break the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip; the ship was boarded by Israeli commandos with the loss of the lives of nine passengers.

[^38]: . John McCain, for example, employed the “no daylight” rhetoric, as cited in note 26 in chapter II. For the bus metaphor, see Niv Ellis, “Romney: Obama ‘Threw Israel under the Bus,’” _Jerusalem Post_, January 27, 2012, http://www.jpost.com/]], and Mackenzie Weinger, “Mitt Romney: Democrats Threw Israel under Bus,” _Politico_, September 5, 2012, http://www.politico.com/]]. Romney stated that the controversy at the Democratic National Convention over a plank in the party platform affirming Jerusalem as Israel’s capital was “one more example of Israel being thrown under the bus by the president.”

[^39]: . American casino mogul Sheldon Adelson was the main supporter of Newt Gingrich’s failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination and was the largest single funder of the Romney campaign and other efforts to unseat Obama in 2012. A _New York Times_ editorial, “What Sheldon Adelson Wants,” June 23, 2012, indicates Adelson’s primary interest in both: “The first answer is clearly his disgust for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, supported by President Obama and most Israelis. He considers a Palestinian state ‘a steppingstone for the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people,’ and has called the Palestinian prime minister a terrorist. He is even further to the right than the main pro-Israeli lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which he broke with in 2007 when it supported economic aid to the Palestinians.” For a profile of another big political donor with an Israel-centric agenda, see Chemi Shalev, “Jack Rosen: Turning US Presidents from Friends in Need to Friends Indeed,” _Haaretz_, October 18, 2012, http://www.haaretz.com/]].

[^40]: . The most striking example is the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, set up and funded by the Israeli American billionaire TV and entertainment proprietor Haim Saban, who is profiled by Connie Bruck in “The Influencer: An Entertainment Mogul Sets His Sights on Foreign Policy,” _New Yorker_, May 10, 2010, http://www.newyorker.com]]. Saban is a powerful advocate for Israel within the Democratic Party, albeit apparently not a party donor on the same scale as Sheldon Adelson is to the Republicans, according to his own words in his op-ed “The Truth about Obama and Israel,” _New York Times_, September 5, 2012. In that article he asserts, “As a sign of its support, the Obama administration even vetoed a Security Council resolution on Israeli settlements, a resolution that mirrored the president’s position and that of every American administration since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.”

[^41]: . A case in point is Sheldon Adelson’s financial backing for _Ysrael ha-Yom_, a free newspaper and Israel’s largest-circulation daily, which was established to support Netanyahu and Likud. Another is the Murdoch-controlled News International multinational empire (in which Saudi Prince Walid ibn Talal ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz Al Sa’ud is a major investor), whose media properties, including Fox News, the _Wall Street Journal_, the _New York Post_, and many other US, British, and Australian outlets, are all fiercely pro-Netanyahu and anti-Palestinian.

[^43]: . Beinart, _The Crisis of Zionism_, p. 154.

[^44]: . Peter Beinart argues convincingly in his article “The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment,” _New York Review of Books_, June 10, 2010, and more fully in his book _The Crisis of Zionism_ that there has been a significant rightward shift of an aging leadership of the institutions of the American Jewish community that are most supportive of a hard line on Israel, like the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, AIPAC, the American Jewish Congress, the ADL, and others, which have thus distanced themselves from the more liberal and younger strata of that community.

[^45]: . According to a 2012 Congressional Research Service report, “US Foreign Aid to Israel,” http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf]], Israel is the largest recipient of US aid since World War II, receiving a total thus far of $115 billion. Military aid to Israel (economic aid to one of the richest countries in the world was finally phased out in 2007) has gone from $2.55 billion in FY 2009 to over $3.1 billion requested by the Obama administration in FY 2013, plus almost another $100 million in the defense budget for development of an Israeli missile shield. This is only one case where US assistance is not part of the foreign aid budget, but rather part of the massive and opaque defense and intelligence budgets.

[^46]: . Misha Glenny op-ed, “A Weapon We Can’t Control,” _New York Times_, June 25, 2012, http://www.nytimes.com/]].

[^47]: . The conclusions of the UN report were largely borne out by the findings of inquiries by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the Israeli human rights NGO B’Tselem. For the text of the report see UN Human Rights Council, “United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict,” http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsessio n/9/factfindingmission.htm]].

[^48]: . Shurat HaDin Israel Law Center, an aggressive right-wing Israeli NGO, is a primary opponent of the use of legal means against Israel, while itself being a leading practitioner of the use of such means against critics of Israel: http://www.israellawcenter.org/]]. Several other right-wing Israeli NGOs follow the same approach, including NGO Monitor, http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/ngo_lawfare]]. An American group with the same aims and ideological orientation is the Lawfare Project, http://www.thelawfareproject.org/]].

[^49]: . It was pointed out in response at the same May 2010 meeting that when Palestinians abstain from “terrorism” in response to the urgings of the United States (as in the president’s 2009 Cairo speech), and instead use nonviolent legal and diplomatic means to press their case, they are accused of “delegitimizing” Israel, presumably meaning that they are supposed to roll over and do nothing, except rely on biased and misguided American sponsorship of further endless and fruitless negotiations: private communication to the author, May 21, 2010.

[^50]: . The Cairo speech is at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-cairo-university-6-04-09]], and that given in Istanbul at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-Of-President-Barack-Obama-At-Student-Roundtable-In-Istanbul]].

[^51]: . In Istanbul, Obama said on this subject only that a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “will be based on two states, side by side: a Palestinian state and a Jewish state,” and that “in the Muslim world this notion that somehow everything is the fault of the Israelis lacks balance.”

[^52]: . A good summary of these grievances can be found in Dov Waxman, “The Real Problem in US-Israel Relations,” _Washington Quarterly_ 35, no. 2 (Spring 2012): 71–87.

[^53]: . Jodi Rudoren, “Israeli Leaders Could Be Dissuaded from Striking Iran,” _New York Times_, August 15, 2012. There was tail-wagging-the-dog-type pressure aplenty as well: a former Israeli national security advisor and deputy chief of staff is quoted in the same article: “But ‘[the Israelis] have to make the decision whether to strike or not before November’ … so they need to hear from Mr. Obama ‘in the coming two weeks, in the coming month.’”

[^54]: . The relevant section of Bush’s letter reads: “In light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli populations [_sic_] centers, it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949, and all previous efforts to negotiate a two-state solution have reached the same conclusion. It is realistic to expect that any final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities.” http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/04/20040414-4.html]].

[^55]: . This was the burden of the argument put forward by Salam Fayyad, prime minister of the PA, to Stephen Hadley, Bush’s national security advisor. Hadley brushed off Fayyad, saying, “Our position on settlements is consistent and has not changed. But let us focus on the now. There is an opportunity in the Gaza Disengagement.” Palestine Papers, “Meeting, National Security Council,” April 16, 2005. http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/201218 233655812228.html]].

[^56]: . As mentioned in chapter I, the United States voted in favor of GA 194 of 1948, which mandated that Palestinians had these rights, and until 1992 voted annually in the General Assembly for resolutions that reaffirmed this resolution. It joined Israel in abstaining on such a resolution in 1993, and by 1998 both countries were voting against it, as they have done since.

[^57]: . The relevant passage states: “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.” http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/full/380]].

[^58]: . Abrams had the added distinction of having been convicted in October 1991 of two misdemeanors for lying to Congress. He was pardoned by George H. W. Bush just before he left office. Abrams was also publicly censured in 1997 by the DC Court of Appeals for three times giving false testimony to Congress. http://www.fas.org/irp/offdocs/walsh/summpros.htm]].

[^59]: . Thus in 1996 a group including Perle and Feith had presented incoming Likud prime minister Netanyahu with a policy paper entitled “A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm,” which recommended various extreme and aggressive options to the Israeli government, including opposing the Oslo Accords and the idea of comprehensive peace with the Arabs, and the “rollback” of hostile entities and states, meaning forcible regime change, policies they later propagated for adoption by the United States during the George W. Bush administration. http://www.iasps.org/strat1.htm]].

[^61]: . These were posted by the British _Guardian_ newspaper in association with the Qatari al-Jazeera satellite TV network on their respective websites under the rubric “The Palestine Papers.” These documents, which I have cited several times, show every possible indication of being genuine, and greatly extend our knowledge base through the late Clinton and especially Bush II administrations, for which solid documentation is relatively scarce.

[^62]: . Of course, in another sense, Israel itself is the metropole of the colonial endeavor in the occupied territories. In yet another sense, however, one that would have instantly been recognized by the generation of the founder of modern political Zionism, Theodor Herzl, the Western world as a whole is the metropole for the entire Zionist enterprise insofar as it was and is a colonial phenomenon, something of which Herzl and his generation were not in the least ashamed.

[^63]: . Among the numerous American “charitable” organizations (all of which have 501c3 tax-deductible status) engaged in financial support of the Israeli settlement, colonization, and occupation enterprise is the Irving Moskowitz Foundation, named for and run by the Florida bingo and gambling magnate of the same name, which has been at work in Jerusalem and elsewhere in the occupied territories since 1969 supporting extreme religious nationalist groups like Ateret Cohanim with several million dollars in subventions annually. http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Moskowitz_Irving]].

[^65]: . This was a trilateral meeting with Palestinian and Israeli delegations headed by Abu Ala and Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni. Palestine Papers, Trilateral Meeting Minutes, Jerusalem, June 15, 2008, http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/ 201218233143171169.html]].

[^66]: . Palestine Papers, Rice-Abu Ala Meeting, March 31, 2008. Similarly, David Welch, the assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, brushed aside the domestic constraints on the Palestinians and warned them: “Do not interrupt the negotiations for other reasons, such as the announcement of [Israel] constructing new residential units in settlements.” http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/20121 823221962189.html]].

[^67]: . Palestine Papers, Fayyad-Hadley Meeting, April 16, 2005.

[^68]: . Mitchell had been obliged to abandon any hope of changing the policy toward Hamas less than eighteen months after he took up his position, as can be seen from his answer to a question about Hamas in an August 2010 press conference in which he argued strenuously that the situation in Northern Ireland with the IRA was quite different from that in Palestine with Hamas. http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/08/31/press-briefing-special-envoy-middle-east-peace-senat or-george-mitchell]].

[^69]: . The degree of American support for Fateh-dominated PA leadership against Hamas is a constant theme in the documents revealed in the Palestine Papers. Thus in 2008, Condoleezza Rice and the Palestinian delegation headed by Abu al-‘Ala devoted most of one meeting to discussing how to meet the challenge posed by Hamas, which was also part of the discussion the same day between the Palestinians and an Israeli delegation headed by Tzipi Livni: Palestine Papers, “Minutes from Berlin Meetings Post Annapolis,” June 24, 2008, http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/201218 233057343352.html]].

[^70]: . It was formally titled the “Sharm El-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee Report,” and was delivered to President Bush on April 30, 2001. It reads today as a remarkably evenhanded document, another reason Mitchell may have been regarded with suspicion by Israeli decision-makers, used to far less than evenhanded American mediation. http://eeas.europa.eu/mepp/docs/mitchell_report_2001_en.pdf]].

Zelikow: Who was on the Israeli end of the channel? Ross: Ely [Elyakim] Rubinstein was the initial [contact].” This illuminates the role played by Ross in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, during which Rubinstein, with whom this interview shows Ross had been in close contact for two years, was head of the Israeli delegation. http://millercenter.org/president/bush/oralhistory/dennis-ross]].

[^85]: . As eminent Iran expert Gary Sick, in “What If Israel Bombs Iran?,” CNN, http://www.cnn.com]], and others have shown, “Most of the top security officials in the Pentagon have warned against such a war.” Thus Obama was supported in his position by all the key segments of the bureaucracy: the military, the intelligence community, and the diplomats.
