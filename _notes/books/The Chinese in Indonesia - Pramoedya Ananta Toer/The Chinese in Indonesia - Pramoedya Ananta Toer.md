Acknowledgments and Publisher’s Notes

  

Publication of this first complete English translation of Hoakiau di Indonesia would not have been possible without the commitment and help of Mary Redway, James Redway, Nancy Chng and Lena Lim.

  

Mary Redway, in particular, has been instrumental in the initiation and early editing of this work.

  

We would also like to thank Professor K.S. Jomo, Mr. Max Lane, Professor Leo Ou-Fan Lee and Professor Sumit K. Mandal for the essays used in this publication. These essays contribute greatly in providing a more complete picture of the author and this work.

  

In the concluding chapter of the book, the author points to the insufficiency of social-historical materials on the Chinese in Indonesia as one reason that racialists could “enter [this] area and appoint themselves as supreme rulers and then practice their brinkmanship” and pleads for the publishing of more works on the Chinese in Indonesia.

  

The publication of this translation is based on this shared conviction that overcoming ignorance is a critical step towards achieving a just and humane world for all.

  

About the Cover

  

The cover background features the famous Megamendung (storm cloud) batik design of Cirebon, Java, which was, for many centuries, a centre of Islam. This traditional Javanese textile style features Chinese-influenced motifs and patterns, which arrived in Java through Chinese ceramics, paintings and embroidered textiles.

  

We are grateful to Dr. Sharon Siddique for providing the inspiration for the cover design.

ON THE AUTHOR 

## Pramoedya: Defiant to the End

  

## K.S. Jomo

  

In April 2006, one of the world’s greatest literary giants went to meet his maker without being properly recognised by the international literary community. True, Pramoedya Ananta Toer was honoured by PEN, but he never received any of the major literary prizes he so richly deserved. Only in recent years was he honoured with a number of Asian awards, although he had been translated into well over 30 languages, mainly in Europe.

  

Pramoedya was not only a literary icon, but also a symbol of left-wing nationalist political defiance. Although best known for his novels, many of which have an almost epic character, my preference has always been for his short stories. Many of these were almost feminist in sensibility, but written well before the modern feminist movement of the last third of the 20th century.

  

Pram was also a trenchant essayist who did not shy away from controversy and robust debate, usually thriving as the underdog. His polemical essays on historical subjects have contributed to a significant and original reinterpretation of the sources of the Indonesian nationalist and anti-colonial movements.

  

His essays underscored the importance of ethnic Chinese publishers in the promotion of the Malay language (then the native tongue of a very small minority of the Indonesian population) throughout the Dutch East Indies from the late 19th century (as elaborated by the works of the historian Ahmat Adam and bibliographer Ding Choo Ming).

  

Working in parallel with Benedict Anderson – his admirer and arguably the finest observer and most original scholar of modern Southeast Asia politics, who underscored the role of ‘print capitalism’ in the imagining of the nation – Pram’s Tempo Doeloe (Past Times) captures the significance of the media and the emergence of Malay – originally the language of a small minority, but crucially, the language of regional commerce – as the common (and later national) language of the Dutch East Indies.

  

His Buru Quartet – built around the historical character of the pioneering journalist Raden Mas Tirto Adisuryo, who helped set up the first patriotic national (as opposed to Javanese) movement, Sarekat Islam (of which one faction, the Sarekat Islam Merah, was closely associated with the Indonesian Communist Party, the PKI) – subtly drew attention to both indigenous as well as international influences on the early nationalist movement in Indonesia. His literary device of changing the narrator in the final volume sharply reminds the reader of imperial surveillance and repression as well as indigenous collaboration despite humiliating subjugation.

  

Pram was a proud and defiant man from an early age. He suffered during the Japanese Occupation, but did not condemn those nationalists who sought to use the political space offered by inter-imperialist rivalry to further the nationalist cause. Later, he was jailed by the returning Dutch colonialists, but never descended into anti-European jingoism.

  

During the Soekarno presidency, he was detained by the army for over a year in the early sixties for expressing support for ethnic Chinese subjected to persecution, most notably in Hoakiau di Indonesia (The Chinese in Indonesia). Yet he never turned against the first Indonesian President despite his opposition to aspects of Soekarno’s government.

  

After the military coup of October 1965, his library was burnt, his house was confiscated and he was personally brutalised – losing his hearing in one ear to a rifle butt – before being incarcerated for 14 years, much of the time on the remote and almost barren island of Buru.

  

In 1989, I met Pram, his editor Joesoef Isak and publisher Hasjim Rachman, all men of letters and recently released political prisoners, and agreed to publish Pram’s post-Buru work in Malaysia as his books had been banned in Indonesia within days of appearing in the bookshops there.

  

Years later, the avuncular Pram took special delight in meeting my then young children, reminiscent of Lu Xun’s description of one who glares defiantly at the overwhelmingly stronger enemy, yet is cowed by the innocence of young children.

  

Before leaving to work in New York, my wife and I visited Pram and his wife at their new home in the hills near Jakarta in late 2004. Some years before, he had bought the land with some of his Magsaysay prize money, and for years thereafter, spent much of his time working this land. Later, after winning the Fukuoka prize, he built this house, where he enjoyed entertaining his grandchildren on their weekend visits as well as visitors.

  

His actual literary output after his release in 1979 seems quite modest in contrast with his earlier work up to 1965. In fact, his six major historical novels published after his release were largely written during his last years on Buru after he was finally allowed access to a typewriter, with many only published thanks to the deft editorial hand of Joesoef Isak, who was Secretary General of the Afro-Asian Journalists’ Association until his arrest.

  

Besides engaging in vigorous polemics on political and cultural issues of the day, Pram also wrote a significant amount of non-fiction, including a collection of lectures on Indonesian history, his book on ethnic Chinese Indonesians and Tempo Doeloe.

  

However, he never came close to completing his intended magnum opus, an encyclopaedia of Indonesian geography. His explanation of the reason for engaging in this painstaking project and his many requests for additional reference materials (such as the two-volume History of Java by Sir Stamford Raffles) was that one cannot truly love one’s country if one does not know it.

  

I feel humbled and honoured to have sat at the feet of such a giant of a man, who was defiant and brave to the last.

## Pramoedya Ananta Toer: In Memoriam

  

## Leo Ou-Fan Lee

  

(written 4 May 2006)

  

This morning as I opened my email, a message from a reporter from the China Times in Taiwan informed me that the Indonesian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer was dead. “Is he an important writer?” the reporter asked innocently. Important? That would be an understatement, for I consider him to be not merely Indonesia’s greatest writer but one of the most significant writers of the twentieth century. If I were asked to nominate one Asian writer for the Nobel Prize, I would have no hesitation in nominating him; in fact Pramoedya has been nominated many times – but to no avail. Too late! Once again, the Nobel Committee has missed out!

  

I first came upon Pramoedya’s novel, This Earth of Mankind, the first of his renowned Buru Quartet depicting the rise of Indonesian national consciousness, in a bookstore in Singapore in 1989. It was the first Indonesian novel I ever read and I was overwhelmed. I read every word of its small print (in the English translation by Max Lane in a Penguin paperback) so intensely that my eyes became bleared. I had to go to an eye doctor for treatment.

  

It was a momentous occasion for myself: in fact, my own consciousness of Indonesia – in particular its modern history – was raised by the novel, and I became aware of a brave new world through the eyes of Minke, the novel’s young hero. Later on, I bought other volumes and followed the Footsteps (the title of the third volume) of this Child of All Nations (the second volume). What struck me most was that this avowedly leftist writer lavishes such painstaking care on depicting the Dutch colonial background of Minke’s education – presumably out of a sense of historical fidelity a la Balzac and Stendhal. There is no modern Chinese historical novel I can think of that is remotely comparable to it: Imagine writing a long roman-a-clef modelled after the life and career of Liang Qichao, China’s first great journalist and a formidable intellectual who was, like Minke, the originator of many significant ideas of Chinese nationalism. (As most of the Indonesian readers already know, Pramoedya’s Minke was modelled after Tirto Adisuryo, a real journalist). For Chinese readers, it bears mentioning that Pramoedya not only visited China but was first imprisoned in 1960 for defending the country’s persecuted ethnic Chinese. You can imagine my astonishment when I read Footsteps and learned that after Minke’s first wife died, he fell in love with a frail Chinese woman and married her – only to suffer a second bereavement. She was a Chinese nationalist and a revolutionary!

  

For those who think the works are sheer ‘leftist’ propaganda, let them read the fourth volume, House of Glass, in which the protagonist/narrator is on the opposite side – Minke’s nemesis and an evil man who slowly and deliberately persecutes him to death. It is out of the envious introspections of this colonial servant that we finally gain the true measure of this nationalist hero’s greatness. Obviously Pramoedya was quite versed in Western literature and its modern narrative techniques. (The first three volumes can be regarded as a form of bildungsroman). Still, he kept his fictional devices to a minimum in order to preserve this historical truth. Such a move is in sharp contrast to most contemporary post-modern fictions, which have no truths to speak of, merely displays of technique and word play. Perhaps a national saga has to be written by someone who truly experienced all the tribulations and suffered all these years for a utopian cause that, alas, is yet to be realised.

  

Only two months ago in the International Herald Tribune (9 March 2006), an article by Michael Vatikiotis informed us that Pramoedya had just published his latest work about The Great Post Road, the first modern highway in northern Java built by Indonesian slaves under orders of the Dutch colonial government. Like everywhere else in Asian countries, modernity was acquired at a great price, the price of at least 12,000 human lives.

  

I have no idea if Pramoedya’s novels have been translated into Chinese in addition to its translations into 28 other languages. But I for one have been championing his literary cause for over a decade. But my clarion calls have so far been met with silence in the Chinese communities.

  

Perhaps Pramoedya is used to it now. As the modern Chinese writer Lu Xun once said in a classical poem, “Where there is silence, one hears thunder”. This time the ‘thunder’ has surely come to us from east of Java, from Buru Island where Pramoedya spent fourteen long years (1965-79) and the best years of his life as a political prisoner.

Section Two

  

ON THE WORK 

## Pramoedya, Racialism and Socialism

  

## Max Lane

  

Pramoedya Ananta Toer’s The Chinese in Indonesia is a polemical work against the racism and the racialist ideas and policies being propagated in Indonesia in 1959 and 1960, and associated with a government policy aimed at excluding Chinese Indonesians from operating as merchants in middle and small town Indonesia. The book is based on a series of articles on the front page of Jakarta’s biggest selling daily newspaper at the time, Bintang Timur, published by one of Indonesia’s great newspaper and publishing figures, the late Hasyim Rahman. Hasyim was to be a close collaborator with Toer during his years in Suharto’s prisons (1965-79) and for more than a decade after that.

  

It is remarkable that Toer’s work is the only significant writing opposing anti-Chinese racism from that period, outside of articles written by Chinese community leaders themselves, especially those associated with the left-oriented BAPERKI group. This contrasts markedly with the situation in Indonesia today, where there is a relative flourishing of commentary on this issue and an increase in debate about the so-called ‘Chinese question’ by Chinese-Indonesian intellectuals and community activists.

  

This very active increase in writing is a direct product of the increased strength of a new democratic agenda that developed during the period of the Suharto regime in opposition to that regime. This agenda comprises a wide range of differing emphasis, but all within a framework that demands recognition of basic human and democratic rights, and an end to all discrimination. The creation of this agenda has been one of the most fundamental features of the last 30 years of Indonesian history.

  

An ‘agenda’, of course, does not exist in the abstract separate from any agents, any human beings, developing its ideas, advocating for them, and mobilising support for these ideas. In Indonesia, there have developed scores of groups out of the movement against Suharto, especially during the 1980s and 1990s. These were think tanks and research institutes, new trade unions, peasant organisations and women’s groups, human rights organisations, political organisations and most prolifically, ad hoc action committees. These have sprung up in relation to every kind of injustice and abuse and in opposition to more general anti-democratic phenomenon such as the presence of the military in political life and institutions.

  

These scores, indeed hundreds, of organisations still only directly involve a small percentage of the population. Indonesia has not yet re-entered a situation such as that existed in the 1950s and 1960s where literally millions of people were active in political or social movement organisations. In 1965, the new ruling group, headed by General Suharto, concentrated its full military might to murder between 1 and 2 million of these people, imprison tens of thousands of others, and thus terrorise tens of millions more people away from such political involvement and activity. The leading mass activist organisations, the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), as well as its associated mass organisations were not only subject to this mass violence but also banned. Other mass organisations, such as the Indonesian National Party and its affiliates, were not banned but they too saw thousands of their members killed and imprisoned.

  

The policies of suppression were implemented in a sustained manner for the last 30 years, accompanied by a massive programme of falsification of history and general de-education in social and political affairs through the formal education system.

  

The re-emergence of activist politics and of political and other civic organisations campaigning for democratic issues and values takes place within the framework of a recovery from these three decades of oppression.

  

Toer’s book, The Chinese in Indonesia, was re-published in 1998 after the fall of the Suharto dictatorship by a small publisher located among a section of these new democratic agenda organisations.

  

However, the significance of the rise of the new democratic agenda activity is not just that it brought into being groups and individuals interested and capable of re-publishing this book. It is also highly significant, indeed central, that Toer’s arguments in this book are assessed and re-located forty years later. At one level, it points to the reality that the issues of discrimination against Chinese-Indonesians worsened during the period of dictatorship and remain today, such that democratic intellectuals, including Chinese-Indonesians, considered that the book was still relevant. At another level, it points to a framework in which Toer’s ideas about the process of integration of the Chinese-Indonesian community into the Indonesian nation can be re-evaluated.

  

Discrimination and integration: the dictatorship’s framework

  

Ironically, the Suharto dictatorship adopted one idea which Toer argued for, namely, that capital owned by Chinese-Indonesians should not be viewed as foreign capital but rather domestic Indonesian capital that should be mobilised for production. The overlap with Toer’s views was, however, only superficial. Toer argued for an end to the discrimination against Chinese-Indonesian traders and a policy of better organising and mobilising their capital and skills, especially in the realm of distribution, within a framework of ‘finishing the Indonesian revolution’ with its components of ‘nation-building’, ‘character building’ and ‘guided democracy’ all as part of trying to move Indonesia into a framework of ‘socialism a la Indonesia’, Indonesian socialism.

  

Toer repeatedly asks the question in his book: Why criticise the Chinese for being good at making money and profits when Indonesia remains a liberal, market economy which is oriented around making money and profits? As long as no law is broken, then what is the problem? If there are things happening which are considered to be harmful to society, then change the laws to outlaw them and prosecute anybody of whatever background who breaks these laws. At the same time, he argues from within a framework that was gaining increasing dominance in the early 1960s, namely, that Indonesia should move towards becoming a socialist economy.

  

Indonesia under Suharto’s dictatorship totally reversed this direction. When Suharto’s cabinet issued its 1967 ‘Basic Solution to the Chinese Problem’ and recognised their capital as domestic capital ‘in the hands of aliens’ as distinct from foreign capital, they set in motion a policy of integrating Chinese-Indonesian businesses into the economic strategy and business practices of Suharto’s Indonesia. At the top, this strategy and practice was characterised by deeply embedded cronyism and corruption, into which a layer of Chinese-Indonesian business people also became integrated.

  

But this was not the only level at which Chinese-Indonesian capital was integrated. First, a Chinese middle layer of business people and professionals were absorbed into the rapidly expanding business scene that was fuelled, especially after 1975, by oil and gas revenues and concentrated in a few large metropolitan centres. Second, however, provincial and small town Chinese-Indonesian businesses, like medium and small businesses owned by non-Chinese, remain contained at the provincial and small town level. The huge conglomerate capital blocked their advance upwards towards becoming national scale businesses.

  

Chinese-Indonesians among the toiling sectors of the population, labourers and tradesmen in the cities, and in the mining and port areas of Bangka and Belitung in Sumatra as well as small farmers in areas such as West Kalimantan, suffered the same ups and mostly downs of the rest of the working population. It should be noted that farmers and labourers are where the representation of Chinese-Indonesians as a percentage of the population is the highest. For example, in the 2000 census, the concentration of the Chinese-Indonesian population was 11.54 % in Bangka-Belitung and 9.54% in West Kalimantan, compared with 5.54% in Jakarta and around 1% or less in most other areas. Suryadinata, Arifin and Ananta (2003 p 77-78) estimate that the percentage of Chinese-Indonesians in the total population is between 1.05% and 1.49%, although they note the 2000 Population Census collected data on ethnicity and race based on self-identification. They provide some speculative calculations to account for this, meaning that the percentage may be closer to 2%. It is important to note how this figure averages out higher concentrations of Chinese-Indonesians in mining, port and farming areas, where they are often labourers and poorer.

  

In any case, the business culture into which larger and better-connected Chinese business people were integrated was a culture developed by non-Chinese Indonesian military politicians who quickly enriched themselves and turned themselves into heads of business families. Transparency International, an international corruption watchdog, estimated in a report issued in March 2004, that Suharto himself accumulated through corruption somewhere between US$15 and $35 billion. This was the reverse of the kind of economic integration for which Toer was arguing for in 1960. It was this kind of integration which has fostered the spread of the identification of wealthy Chinese business people, known as cukong, with the phenomenon of cronyism and corruption. Names like Liem Sioe Liong and Bob Hasan have entered popular political culture as symbols of the cukong.

  

While the process of cukong-crony integration into the most lucrative parts of the economy continued, it is also important to note that the oft-heard statement that “the Chinese own 30% of the economy” is both factually wrong as well as a misrepresentation of the social composition of the Chinese-Indonesian population, as has already been discussed. The single biggest economic bloc operating in the Indonesian economy is not the Chinese-Indonesians, but rather the international banks and transnational corporations operating out of North America, Western Europe, Japan and Australia. Apart from the hold that the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have over the economy through using debt as a lever, there is hardly a major high profit sector of the Indonesian economy where international capital does not dominate, either directly or indirectly.

  

The emergence of a high-profile (but tiny) group of Chinese-Indonesian businessmen, well connected to the former dictator, has been probably the major form of political integration of the Chinese-Indonesians. This is also a reversal of the trend that had been developing in Indonesia at the time Toer wrote his book.

  

In the 1960s, Indonesian politics was characterised by a deep and fundamental battle around the question: what kind of country should independent Indonesia become? Political integration of the Chinese-Indonesians was viewed by Toer, and by a large number of Chinese-Indonesian leaders, as something that would be achieved by Chinese-Indonesians, like all Indonesians, joining the struggle to finishing the Indonesian national revolution and consolidating Indonesian socialism. The largest active Chinese-Indonesian organisation during the sixties was BAPERKI (Badan Permusyawaratan Kewarganegaraan Indonesia – Consultative Body of Indonesian Citizens) which adopted this perspective. It was banned and its leaders also arrested in 1965, at the same time as Toer and hundreds of thousands of others.

  

Anti-Chinese prejudice generated by bourgeois interests

  

For Toer, moving in a socialist direction was a crucial part of the solution to discrimination against the Chinese as well as the framework that could facilitate full integration. He repeatedly illustrates how the whole history of discrimination against and oppression of the Chinese has been driven by the dynamics of competition among sections of capital, imperial as well as domestic. The Dutch, he explains, afraid that there were more Chinese active in trade compared to the initial tiny number of Dutch were the first to act against them, even to the extent of carrying out horrific massacres. All the early regulations taking away the rights of Chinese subjects to live and work where they wish were instituted by the Dutch.

  

Evolving in an atmosphere where Dutch policy had ghettoised them, later tensions between Chinese and non-Chinese inhabitants of the ‘Indies’ were, argues Toer, initially stimulated by Dutch manipulation and then further developed as a result of rivalry with non-Chinese aspiring capitalists. He attacks mercilessly the commercial motives of such aspiring business people behind the 1959 regulations against which the book is aimed.

  

Toer’s point here is that the origins of anti-Chinese hatred cannot be traced back to any inherent problems between Chinese and non-Chinese workers and peasants, even if, by the 1960s, anti-Chinese racial stereotyping had gained some influence amongst sections of the masses.

  

Under Suharto’s New Order dictatorship, this dynamic remained, but was given some new twists. First, the relationship between the country’s top capitalists, namely the Suharto family, and other military or politician families, foreign businesses and the largest Chinese-Indonesian capitalists, became increasingly characterised by partnership rather than rivalry. However, the Chinese cukong businessmen, alongside but often more easily appearing alien than the cronies generally, did emerge as a symbol of the blockage that the huge capital of the crony conglomerates represented to the thousands, even tens of thousands, of aspiring medium and small business people that emerged in Indonesia’s oil revenue fuelled business world.

  

Thus, as soon as the economy went into severe crisis in 1997, various political figures, many of whom had previously been in partnership with Chinese-Indonesian businessmen, started to scapegoat them, often using the issue of capital flight. There was a massive campaign from within the Indonesian political and military elite to blame the Chinese for the economic crisis. Then when the crony conglomerates were dislodged from their position of dictatorial political power in May 1998, there were attempts to revive campaigns to dislodge Chinese-Indonesian businesses at all levels. There was one attempt to start such a campaign during the Habibie presidency (1998-99) by the Minister of Cooperatives and Small Enterprises, Adi Sasono, when he began promoting the government ‘cooperatives’ as an alternative distribution system. This echoed almost exactly the propaganda that Toer was answering in 1959 and 1960, even the same claim that there was no specific targeting of Chinese.

  

Even as late as August 2003, there was an attempt to include a reference for preferential treatment to ‘native businesses’ in a key Economic Recovery Decree being considered by the People’s Consultative Assembly. Public opposition, generated initially by the democratic agenda advocacy groups, eventually forced the deletion of this reference.

  

In the post-Suharto period, one result of the long period of partnership between Chinese-Indonesian business cronies and the Suharto family and other leading non-Chinese business groups, is that the word cukong, as a symbol of big business wealth and accumulation, has been over-taken by that of kroni itself. Tensions between smaller businesses and ‘Chinese’ businesses became increasing conflated with anti-kroni and anti-konglomerat sentiment in general. Of course, when Toer wrote his book, the massive business conglomerates built by Suharto’s family did not exist.

  

Nation-building, Indonesian socialism and double alienation

  

The other phenomenon which ended in 1965 upon the seizure of power by the Suharto clique was the central position occupied by the battle over what kind of country Indonesia should become. The violent suppression of the country’s largest political organisations, involving at least 20 million active members, who had been campaigning under the banner of ‘socialism a la Indonesia’, had ‘resolved’ this issue – at least for the time being. From the point of view of the analysis presented by Toer, this would have also taken away the framework in which a real integration of the Chinese-Indonesians could have been achieved.

  

If there was to be no struggle for a socialist Indonesia but rather simply an Indonesia driven by a ‘liberal economy’, where self-enrichment by whatever means available was the engine for all economic activity, as it was under Suharto, then there was no possibility of an integration based on joining with other inhabitants of Indonesia in the struggle to build the nation through a collective, conscious socialist effort.

  

For Toer, Chinese-Indonesians were indeed Indonesians, who happened to have their own specific traditions and culture. He saw no reason for them to give up these traditions simply to become Indonesian. He was a nationalist, but not an assimilationist nationalist. For Toer, the Indonesian nation was still being created, as was its culture. In terms of national culture, Toer was – and still is – in fact an internationalist, taking the best, most progressive and democratic ideas from wherever they had originated – as is the essence of his Child of All Nations, the second of his series of four books on the awakening of Indonesia, beginning with This Earth of Mankind. For Toer, Indonesia was ‘the earth of mankind’, not of some single race, and its ideas were to be drawn from the struggles of all nations. There was no Indonesian culture into which the Chinese-Indonesians could assimilate. There was rather an Indonesian culture to be created. In this latter struggle, perhaps traditions and cultures might need to be abandoned, but the same applied to other traditions as well, especially that of the Javanese.

  

Under the Suharto dictatorship, however, the Chinese-Indonesians’ rights to express their traditions and cultures were suppressed. The Suharto dictatorship instituted policies explicitly banning Chinese traditional cultural practices from being carried out in public. Chinese language schools were suppressed as was the use of the Chinese language in the media. The pressure for Chinese-Indonesians to change their name to an ‘Indonesian’ name was increased. This pressure had been around before 1965 but had been contained by public statements by President Soekarno who often raised the question – which Toer would have also asked – what is an Indonesian name? In a speech at the main Jakarta sports stadium in 1963 at a rally organised by BAPERKI, Soekarno expressed his view on this issue with the following words.

  

But my personal feelings, my brothers and sisters, is that I don’t recognise difference in blood. The same for names. For example my own name, Soekarno. Is it an original Indonesian name? No! It comes from Sanskrit, ‘sukarna’. Ah, over there Abdulgani, Arab; yes brother Roeslan has an Arab name. And then there is Pak Ali, his name is mixed. Ali is Arab, Sastramidjaaja is from Sanskrit. … If you want to be an Indonesian, there is no need to change your name. You want to keep Thiam Nio as your name, fine, why not? … Why do people demand that Chinese-Indonesians change their name if they want to become a citizen of the Republic of Indonesia? ... No! This is a private matter...

  

(Speech by Soekarno at the 8th National Congress of

  

BAPERKI, Jakarta, 14 March 1963)

  

Chinese-Indonesians were subject to a double oppression under Suharto. They were banned from freely practicing their traditions, while along with the rest of the population, disenfranchised from meaningful political participation, namely, in the political struggle to shape Indonesian society.

  

Reformasi, Chinese-Indonesians and Toer’s ideas

  

We often read at the moment how reformasi is dead, or that it has already failed. When the student movement against Suharto reached its peak in May 1998, the cry for reformasi total also reached its height. There were only a few attempts, perhaps even only one attempt (that of the People’s Democratic Party, PRD) to set out comprehensively and analytically what ‘total reformation’ might mean. However, among students and democracy activists of every stripe and from every sector, there was a strong sense as to which direction such a ‘total reformation’ should head. Among the mass of the population too, there were some well accepted components to this: an end to the pervasive presence of the military in politics, an end to corruption, and an end to the total disinterest of the national elite in the material and cultural welfare of the mass of the population.

  

The military, though entrenched as a real power in Papua, no longer play the same pervasive role in day-to-day politics at every level of society. As an institution, the Armed Forces remains intact and its generals are all too eager to return to the centre for power, but – for the time being at least – they have been forced away from the centre and must compete for a share of power with other factions of the elite. But corruption and the gap between the rich and poor continue to grow and to be observed with a lack of interest by the national elite. Reformasi has not delivered an end to corruption or elite apathy. And while dislodged to the edges, the army remains ready for a comeback.

  

But this perspective on reformasi is too narrow and misses the essence of the process. There was never any clear program or agenda for reformasi. The term reformasi only emerged very late in the movement against Suharto as it headed for ultimate confrontation in May 1998 and then became the slogan for the most popular campaign for change since the fall of Suharto. However, reformasi can only really be understood as an extension, a continuation, and a qualitative escalation of a process that began back in the 1970s.

  

The violent repression by the Suharto regime during 1965-66 of all those struggling for ‘socialism a la Indonesia’, through the very magnitude of its violence and the totalitarian nature of the control that followed, had ended a period of Indonesian history – its only history up until then – that had been marked by the central place occupied by the open struggle to decide just what kind of country and society Indonesia would be. Such struggles in the histories of most countries are associated with their great modern revolutions. Suharto in 1965-66 in Indonesia used brute force to suppress the processes of the Indonesian national revolution.

  

However, by the mid-1970s, the struggle over what kind of country and society Indonesia should be had begun again, even though suppressed, partial and hesitant. Huge sections of society, especially among peasants and labourers, were still traumatised by the terror of 1965-66. Millions of activists had disappeared from politics. A whole world of ideas – the ideas of ‘socialism a la Indonesia’, – had vanished, just likes the scores of books and stories written by Pramoedya Ananta Toer and other writers of the Left. The great Suharto falsification of history had begun. Open party politics was banned among the mass of the population.

  

All the same, a new student movement and the poems, plays and songs of popular artists, as well as courageous statements by other dissidents, put the issue back on the agenda. When exactly did this hesitant, very partial movement for reformasi begin? While there is no one event that comes to mind in this respect, I think that when the play The Struggle of the Naga Tribe, written by Rendra, was performed in 1974, it pointed to the fact that the battle had been resumed. Rendra’s play counterposed two possible societal models: that of the idyllic, socially just Naga, with collective control over the land, and that of the exploited, oppressed and socially ruined Kariman tribe. Which one would Indonesia end up? It was during this discussion that Rendra also became a truly national celebrity until his imprisonment by Suharto in 1978 for one year.

  

At that time, Pramoedya Ananta Toer was in the prison camp on Buru island in eastern Indonesia, nine years into his imprisonment.

  

It is not the place here to try to recount the whole process that unfolded from the mid-1970s. What is crucial to note is that reformasi since 1998 is not so much some kind of reform package or even some kind of transition process, implying as the word ‘transition’ does, a conscious movement from A to B. Rather it is the moving back onto centre stage the open conflict over what kind of Indonesia people want – that surely is an implication of the word ‘total’ in ‘total reformation’.

  

There is a deeper issue here, obvious if one thinks about the words: “moving back onto centre stage the open conflict over what kind of Indonesia”. It presumes that this issue has not yet been resolved, despite 1965 and the New Order. It presumes that it is not a settled question. 1965 suppressed a revolution which was still unfinished, as Toer put it in a 2002 Independence Day speech. Now it was reviving.

  

In the same speech, Toer also pointed out that the hesitations in this process were due to a break with the continuity of the earlier revolution. He told the packed crowd in a Jakarta venue:

  

The problem is that the starting point of the younger generation and students, and also the peasants in the interior, has been ‘reformasi’: a movement to restructure and give new content to the New Order. This not only involves avoiding but even negating our national history. We nationally have been born through the national revolution and we succeeded in defeating imperialism, we did that. The stage of the national revolution was followed in 1950 by the stage of the struggle to complete the revolution: now it has been extinguished completely. Forget about things like ‘nation and character building’, instead, now there have been more and more actions murdering the nation, including reviving the old colonial practice of sending Javanese soldiers to the regions to subdue the regions outside Java.

  

Why is all this continuing to happen? My conclusion is that the course of developments since the New Order has turned its back on history as a source of understanding the proper starting point, thereby losing direction, and therefore does not know its destination. In other words, it has lost its way.

  

(‘17 August 1945’, Inside Indonesia, Oct-Dec 2003)

  

The ideas raised by the human rights, labour, peasant, agrarian reform, environment, women, student, fishing folk and scores of other organisations – including those campaigning for the rights of Chinese-Indonesians – have all been contributing elements and energy to the new democratic agenda and the reformasi process. Toer’s view is that this reformasi process can only truly give birth to a new national leadership if there is a realisation that it must be seen as a resumption of the struggle to complete the original revolution.

  

Despite the partial character of the process, underlined by Toer’s remarks about these limitations in consciousness, there can be no doubt that more than twenty years of anti-dictatorship struggle has produced at least the ingredients for both a total reformation policy platform as well as the start to relearn and reassimilate Indonesian revolutionary history. The latter indeed has been one of the main tasks of the six historical novels and one historical play that Toer himself wrote on Buru Island. It was one of the purposes of the 1998 re-publication of The Chinese in Indonesia. It is manifested in the emergence of new organisations explicitly working for a new historical awareness and at de-falsifying the history produced under the dictatorship.

  

For the majority of Chinese-Indonesians, reformasi – in this sense of a struggled resumed – brings with it many opportunities. First, the emphasis on democracy and justice in the reformasi consciousness has meant that the policies of discrimination against Chinese-Indonesians could not be defended as official policy of the State. The ban of practicing Chinese tradition in public was repealed very quickly after Suharto was forced to resign. Imlek, a Chinese traditional day of thanksgiving prayer to the Creator, has become a public holiday. The ban on the use of Chinese writing was lifted. The requirement for Chinese-Indonesians to present proof of their citizenship before their children could get birth certificates, or before they could obtain marriage certificates or other official documents was ended, although many parts of the bureaucracy still refuse to implement this. Discrimination by the state apparatus has by no means disappeared.

  

Second, a more honourable, productive and democratic avenue for integration has opened up again – in the same spirit as Toer’s ideas about joining the struggle for nation building and socialism and finishing the revolution. No longer is the only form of real integration being encouraged that simply of joining the rest of the elite in self-enrichment, although that option is by all means still there for those who choose it and have the wherewithal to join the game. Now, once again, politics is the potential integrator. Politics may divide along ideological and class lines, but it can integrate across ethnic line when there is an open battle over which way a society should and can develop.

  

Even at this very early stage – where everything is hesitant and partial – the open participation of Chinese in political activity is very evident. There are many new Chinese-Indonesian civil organisations campaigning against discrimination. The Jakarta Post newspaper has identified at least 172 Chinese standing for election in the 2004 General Elections, for either the national or local parliaments, compared to just a few before 1998. There is now a plethora of activist organisations raising the issue of discrimination, often more dynamically and clearly than the still mainly elite-based political parties. The issue of the history and position of the Chinese-Indonesians is constantly being debated in the media, with many Chinese-Indonesians also contributing articles. Any assessment of what has been achieved so far in comparison with what still needs to be done will underline how much more needs to be done. However, a comparison with what preceded May 1998 points to a huge leap forward.

  

These initial developments also re-affirm the relevance of Toer’s ideas, and those of the Chinese-Indonesians who argued for integration through joining the struggle to complete the revolution. In an interview with the Straits Times in August 2001, Toer told the journalist something which he has often repeated: “Reformasi is just part of a bigger social revolution, just a beginning which many do not realise.” His arguments in The Chinese in Indonesia on the question of the integration of Chinese-Indonesians remain valid precisely because he is also correct on this question as well.

  

Humanism and the national revolution

  

Toer begins The Chinese in Indonesia with an elementary introduction to the humanist outlook, rejecting collective punishment, racial prejudice and stereotyping and defending freedom of religion and traditions. A favourite saying of Toer is that it is the duty of humans to be human and not take on the demeaning behaviour of beasts. As the first chapter of The Chinese in Indonesia shows, he is also very aware that awareness of a human quality, of ‘kemanusiaan’, of humanity, has developed through history and that early humans did not at all see each other as from the same race, sharing the same earth of mankind, of being the child of all nations.

  

He knows that the notion of humanity both as a quality and a material reality – collective humanity bound ultimately by the same fate – has had a history of its own, travelling specific differing courses through time and place. His works, especially his works from the 1960s onwards, reflect an increasing internationalisation of his sources and ideas. His Buru Quartet (This Earth of Mankind, Child of All Nations, Footsteps and House of Glass) traces some of the history of this notion in Indonesia and its relationship with the emancipatory thinking of the revolutions of France, the Netherlands, America, China and the Philippines.

  

In Indonesia, ‘humanity’ as a category, as distinct from ethnic, racial or religious grouping, has been no less tied up with a national revolution than in Europe and North America, where the concepts of the rights of man also became embodied in various revolutionary manifestos (although later dropped in practice in favour of the rights of property holders). This idea is also prevalent all through Pramoedya’s The Chinese in Indonesia. It is evident in his explicit elaboration of a humanist outlook and in his constant search for the truth about the role of Chinese living in the archipelago and their contributions to the advancement of society and culture and their contributions to the creation of Indonesia.

  

He wrote this book before the 1965-66 counter-revolution against the national revolution, so he did not discuss the implications for the Chinese of an end, reversal or suppression of the national revolutionary process. But now the record speaks for itself. Rolling back the national revolution devastated and narrowed grossly the internationalisation of Indonesian national culture. Before 1965, a national culture was being forged from an engagement from within the Indonesian historical process with all the world’s revolutionary ideas, bourgeois and proletarian – Sun Yat Sen, Mao Tse Tung, Marx, Lenin, Jefferson, Lincoln, Rousseau, Rizal, not to mention from the world of the arts and literature. Under the New Order, the engagement with the international was reduced to the non-ideas of Western consumer culture, of the babble of MTV, advertising, soap, and the worst of Hollywood.

  

The nation was sold off commercially and put into hock to the Western states in the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI), which provided most of Indonesia’s conditional loans, and to the IMF, so its cultural development was sold off as well. This is easily done when national history is falsified and then learned by rote in school. Here the Chinese-Indonesians’ burden was also deeper under the New Order. Not only were they were denied the right of expression of their traditions but, like all Indonesians, denied a role in the development of their national Indonesian culture.

  

But there is a deeper, grimmer, consequence of the suppression of the revolution. It is not only that the world of ideas has been impoverished for the mass of the population, but the very concept of ‘humanity’ is made fragile. The magnitude of the violence, the mass murder, that Suharto and his generals (and his American, British and Australian backers) thought necessary negated any development of the concept of humanity from the very beginning. In his 2002 Independence Day speech, Toer quotes a former New Order security boss as saying that there were 2 million people killed in the process of establishing the New Order. That is not the basis of developing and embedding ‘humanity’ as part of an established cultural outlook.

  

As soon as this anti-human, counter-revolutionary violence began in 1965, some Chinese became victims. In speeches from October 1965 onwards, Soekarno – who had in fact already lost real power to General Suharto – constantly protested against racialist incidents. He identified the dynamics of where anti-Chinese agitation came from in the aftermath of the attempted mutiny in the Armed Forces known as the 30th September Movement, that Toer had provided in the situation of 1960. In a speech at the Presidential Palace to cabinet ministers on 23 October, 1965, Soekarno criticised the way many groups were falsely accusing their rivals of being supporters of the 30th September Movement and therefore liable for punishment: death, arrest or having their property seized.

  

In the economic arena for example, there are those economic groups, a grouping of businessmen, who have for some time now, for many years faced competition and suffered blows from the Chinese in the commercial arena. Yes, it is often said: “Chinezen zijn pienterder dan wij” (the Chinese are cleverer than us) in commerce. But then this is manipulated by our economic grouping, those that have been hit by competition, been defeated in commercial rivalry from the Chinese. They come to me and say that these other groups have supported the 30th September Movement, that they are communists, supported by the People’s Republic of China. But with the people saying this, this is the first time ever in their whole life they have ever said a word about politics. They had never talked about politics before. They just made money, made money, made money, in business.

  

(Revolusi Belum Selesai, Jakarta, 2003)

  

From the very moment that Suharto took over and began his purge, anti-Chinese sentiment was propagated by sections of businesses for their own purposes. As a result, racialist attacks on Chinese did take place during the violent purges of 1965-66 although the business-motivated agitation never succeeded in provoking widespread attacks on the Chinese. The ethnicity of those massacred in 1965-66 was, as the Australian historian of Indonesian Chinese, Charles Coppel wrote: “… their ethnicity was overwhelmingly Javanese and Balinese rather than Chinese. If anything the ethnic Chinese were underrepresented in the massacres which were directed against members of the Indonesian Communist Party and its affiliated organisations (in which the Chinese were also under-represented). Most killings took place in the rural areas of Java and Bali. In these islands most of the ethnic Chinese resided in urban areas.”

  

Interestingly and again pointing to a simple monetary motivation being behind what did happen to the Chinese-Indonesians at that time, Coppel also writes: “... in most cases violence against them took the form of destruction of property (buildings, shops, houses, motor vehicles) rather than violence against Chinese people themselves.” Assets were being destroyed.

  

In some ways, the mass murders had the same depth of inhumanity as the Holocaust against the Jewish people in Europe under the Nazis, which Toer also discusses in this book. But in Indonesia, the mass killings took place before the national revolution was finished, before Indonesian culture has been established in the same way that European culture had been by its revolutions.

  

Establishing itself on a massive and violent denial of humanity, engaging only with those aspects of modern international culture with least humane qualities, preventing the development of a real forward movement in cultural life at the mass level beyond what was left from the days of colonial and feudal despotic rule, and crushing the cultural energy of the popular mass movements, the New Order created circumstances where ‘humanity’ becomes a category easily quashed. In this environment, it is not surprising that demagogues – many of whom are suspected to be linked to the army – wanting to divert attention away from their own role in Indonesia’s recent decline into crisis have had some success in scapegoating Chinese-Indonesians on a racialist basis and generating ugly outbreaks of anti-Chinese violence, even if rare and involving few people. Incidents of violence against Chinese took place several times during the New Order. The worst case was undoubtedly the multiple rapes – and sometimes rape and murder – of scores of Chinese women during the riots of May 1998. Apart from rape and murder, there were many documented cases of public stripping of Chinese women. However, such events have not re-occurred in the period since reformasi has been unfolding.

  

Whether it was the deep inhumanity of the mass murders of 1965, the ‘shock therapy’ killings of thousands of released petty criminals ordered by Suharto in the 1980s, massacres and torture in Aceh, south Sumatra or East Timor or the brutal public stripping, rapes and murders of Chinese women in 1998, some of Toer’s concluding words in his 1960 book still ring so true:

  

“... we cannot let go unopposed a process that violates values of humanity. We must step forward and state that everything that violates humanity is barbaric. And because human beings embody a humanist and humane spirit, a human being without such a spirit is, at best, only half human. The other half is beast.”

  

1960 and 2005

  

Toer’s book was first published in 1960. Indonesia was at a different moment in its history. In Toer’s own words from his 2002 Independence Day speech, Indonesia in the 1960s was in “the stage of the struggle to complete the revolution”. In fact, in 1960, the forces wanting to ”complete the revolution” and head in a socialist direction were just gathering their forces. President Soekarno had announced the idea of Guided Democracy. The old parliament and the interim 1950s Constitution had been dissolved and the original 1945 Constitution was revived and a new parliament formed – both by Presidential decree. However, Soekarno and the rest of the various groups on the left were by no means ascendant. Neither Guided Democracy nor Guided Economy ever won the chance to prove themselves in practice as systems of governance and economic development as President Soekarno and the left faced constant challenge and disruption from their opponents, including the military, who wielded enormous power. The whole period was simply a battlefield.

  

In this battlefield, Toer himself was an early casualty. He was detained by the martial law authorities in 1960 after they banned this book. No doubt the political and business interests Toer attacks in his book for spreading race hatred simply as a means to get their hands on Chinese-Indonesian assets took offence. The army itself then began to make its own stand on the position of Chinese-Indonesians very clear. It supported a small group of Chinese-Indonesians advocating assimilation, even to the extent of calling on Chinese to inter-marry as a way to ‘de-sinify’ themselves. They advocated changing their names. The army supported a number of organisations advocating this, the most important one being the Institute for the Development of National Unity (LPKB), established in 1963 and headed by Ong Tjong Hai, who changed his name to Kristoforus Sindhunatha and was a naval officer. LPKB figures were prominent in helping Suharto formulate the New Order laws banning traditional Chinese cultural practices and pressuring Chinese-Indonesians to change their names.

  

Toer was a year in gaol without charge and trial until almost the end of 1960. After that he was under house-arrest and then town-arrest for another extended period. President Soekarno had been unable to prevent the promulgation of the P.P. No 10 in the face of support for it from business interests and the military. He was only able to campaign publicly for a mild form of implementation. So Soekarno was unable to prevent Toer’s detention. In a sign of things to come, Toer’s case was handled by an army major who was later to serve as Suharto’s cabinet secretary and then his Vice-President.

  

The first battle in the “stage to complete the revolution” ended in 1965, when again Toer was a casualty being imprisoned again without charge or trial, this time for fourteen years. ‘Guerilla war’ and skirmishes marked the politics of the period between 1974 and 1997. Then in 1997 and 1998 another big battle delivered a death blow to dictatorship, although not to all the policies and institutions that Suharto’s dictatorship had put in place. But a new battlefield was opened. There have been more skirmishes and guerrilla forays but the big battles have yet to be joined, waiting – as Toer has said – for the young leaders of today’s skirmishes to connect with the revolutionary process that was unfolding before 1965 and was suppressed.

  

There are some stark differences between the field of battle then and now. The movement for Indonesian socialism had millions of active supporters. Indonesia’s world of ideas and political culture was inhabited by the most radical and dynamic of ideas from all the world’s previous revolutions, bourgeois and proletarian. The world itself was in the midst of a global battle, with the People’s Republic of China at the forefront of what appeared to be a serious ideological challenge to the United States. Toer’s book is also a defence of Indonesia’s right to cooperate with the PRC and reflected his admiration for the huge leaps in quality of material and cultural life that Chinese society had achieved in only fifteen years since the Chinese revolution. During the 1960s, the accusation was made against the Chinese of being communist ‘fifth columnists” as well as of being too clever at business. Toer’s book also polemicises against this propaganda.

  

Today, the Communist Party of the PRC is no longer a party of any ideological challenge on the global scene and the movement for socialism in Indonesia is just regrouping. The only serious socialist party, the People’s Democratic Party (PRD), is still small, even though it played a leading role in paving the way for the overthrow of Suharto, at the cost of having several of its members being ‘disappeared’. Toer, in his late 60s at that time, soon joined the PRD, a party where the average age of the membership was probably less than 25. In semi-retirement, he could not be an active member, but he was re-affirming his commitment to continuing “the completion of the revolution” and expressing his solidarity with the youth.

  

Neither had he finished speaking out on the issue of racialism. Indeed, his agreement to the re-publishing of The Chinese in Indonesia is also a re-affirmation of his commitment on this issue. As a writer, he has also edited the publication Tempo Doeloe,, a collection of pre-Indonesian literature which includes some of the Chinese who pioneered the use of Malay as a modern literary language. He also edited the memoirs of Oei Tjoe Tjat, a leading member of the Chinese-Indonesian community who rose to become a minister in the Soekarno government and suffered imprisonment like Toer after 1965. He has helped promote the publication of books by and about Siauw Giok Tjhan, the former head of BAPERKI, the most important progressive, pro-integrationist Chinese-Indonesian community organisation until it was banned in 1965. In this regard, he remains an outspoken advocate of the need to study and publish the real history of the Chinese in Indonesia, just as he advocated in 1960.

  

For Toer, the struggle for the Indonesian nation, for an internationalist and humanist national culture, for Indonesian socialism, and for an end to prejudice against Chinese-Indonesians and Chinese elsewhere were all elements of the struggle to complete the revolution. They were all tied together:

  

… every domestic uproar over race will develop to fuel the rise of provincialism in Indonesia, which has been eradicated so far by the Indonesian people, not only with great difficulty but also taking more than one generation. The spread of these non-revolutionary – in fact, counter-revolutionary – processes can eventually negate the revolution itself.

  

Counter-revolution did take place. Being mostly a part of the Indonesian people, Chinese-Indonesians suffered the same fundamental deprivation of the counter-revolution: denial of participation in politics and in the struggle to not just build, but also define, nation and society. Some joined the counter-revolution and partnered up with the generals too.

  

The fall of Suharto was a major blow to this counter-revolution. There is now space for debate and for more struggle and there is a democratic agenda as a legacy from a previous twenty years of struggle against dictatorship, an agenda which has legitimised and created the ideological space for the formation of many groups campaigning for an end to anti-Chinese prejudice and discrimination. The battle on all fronts can and has already resumed in the open.

  

But there still is a battle. Despite the reform of the laws, there are still myriads of complaints by Chinese-Indonesians that the bureaucracy still demands that they present a Letter of Proof of Indonesian Citizenship (known as the SBKRI), a document that recent reforms have formally abolished. Harassment and payments are all associated with these documents, which are the central symbol and indeed concrete manifestation of ongoing discrimination.

  

In Kompas newspaper on 11 February 2004, the 67 year old Tan Joe Hok was interviewed. Tan Joe Hok had represented Indonesia in 1959 in the All England badminton finals and had won a crown for Indonesia, yet in 2004, he was still not a full citizen. He could not obtain a SBKRI. According to the new laws, he should only need to present a birth certificate to show that he or his children or grandchildren are Indonesian. However, the bureaucracy, despite the promises from the political elite in power, still demanded the SBKRI. In this interview, Tan Joe Hok’s final comments were: “It wouldn’t be hard for us to move overseas but we don’t want to do that. Because we are Indonesians. Even if it was raining gold overseas, we will remain here, in the land where Indonesian blood has been spilled.”

  

On the same day, Kompas also printed another article on the same theme. It started with a quote from a 32 year-old Chinese-Indonesian woman living in a poor area of West Jakarta. Her husband was a labourer. “Since I was born, married and had three children, I have never had an I.D. card or birth certificate. I don’t even have a marriage certificate.” This family received no visits to register them as voters in the 2004 General Elections. The reason: they had never been able to get a SBKRI.

  

Reformasi is not a new system or program; it is the name of the contemporary, newly opened arena of struggle. This is true for Indonesian society as a whole, including Chinese-Indonesians. For Toer, the prosecution of struggle within this new arena requires continuity with the revolution that started at the beginning of the century, consolidated with the winning of political independence in 1945, being completed in the 1950s and especially early 1960s, and then suppressed in 1965. Thus he ended his 2002 speech with a message to Indonesia’s youth:

  

“Return to the phase of completing the revolution and complete it.”

Do you then wonder that there is turbulence amongst us? To us, it is normal, and we have become accustomed to riding the whirlwind. I understand well that to the man outside, often the picture must seem one of chaos and disorder, of coups and counter coups. Still, this turbulence is our own [.]

before the United Nations General Assembly, September 1960

  

[Chinese] are not voyagers from abroad landed on our shores. They have been here as long as our own ancestors. They are, in fact, Indonesians, who live and die in Indonesia also, but because of a certain political veiling, suddenly become strangers who are not foreign.

  

Pramoedya Ananta Toer

  

March 1960¹

  

Oddly enough Pramoedya Ananta Toer’s historical critique of the Indonesian nation, his 1960 publication Hoa Kiau di Indonesia (henceforth Hoa Kiau), or ‘The Chinese in Indonesia’, has gone largely unnoticed by scholars.² The book was a response to the ruthless pogroms against Chinese Indonesians launched by the army in the years 1959-1960, the culmination of the growth of anti-Chinese politics since 1956.³ Scholars have typically read this work as an outright defence of the Chinese and at best it is described as “an effective piece of argumentative journalism which illustrates the enlightened view of a small group of sophisticated intellectuals”.⁴ And at worst, it has been seen, on the slim evidence of similar ‘social analysis’ and ‘jargon’ as an indication of the author’s political alignment with the Partai Komunis Indonesia (Communist Party of Indonesia) which did consistently defend the rights of Chinese Indonesians.⁵ Indeed, an important scholar of Indonesian literature says of Pramoedya’s development after 1956 that “the dream of the poet was exchanged for the action of the social fighter”.⁶ What this statement implies, as well as the view of Hoa Kiau mainly as a humanitarian defence, is the death of creativity and imagination. On the contrary, in the period of his heightened focus on non-fictional works, he produced imaginative and creative historical and social studies. Thus, Pramoedya’s growth as an author may be seen as putting the dream of the poet into the social fight.

  

My reading of Hoa Kiau suggests that Pramoedya created a language and historical argument that went well beyond a simple defence of the Chinese in Indonesia. He dwelt precisely on the nation’s ambivalence about her ‘own’ and was unwilling to bow to the chauvinistic nationalism of the time that rested on the estrangement of the Chinese – in his eyes an intimate part of the nation. His perspective is expressed as much in this pithy contemporary solicitation for orders of the book: “Get to know Minorities of Indonesia in order to obtain a picture which is clear about the Nation and People of Indonesia herself”.⁷ As anti-Chinese politics grew in force, especially after the army became a slave to it, ambivalence about the place of Chinese in Indonesia gave way to their physical and political estrangement as ‘foreign’. Pramoedya’s perspective against anti-Chinese policies seemed to have had a powerful impact judging by the enthusiastic response of his readers and then the brutal action taken by the military. For the first time on the soil of independent Indonesia, he was imprisoned for more than a year without trial and under extremely adverse conditions. And the banning of Hoa Kiau soon after its publication marked the first ever prohibition of his work.

  

From his innovative use of Hoakiau, originally a Chinese word of recent vintage meaning ‘Overseas Chinese’, to mean ‘Chinese’ instead of the more common word Tionghoa, to other imaginative introductions into Indonesian, he creates a language that is strange in its time. While the historical and economic arguments that Pramoedya proposes each deserve full treatment, in this paper I pay attention to language. Just as necessary to an appreciation of the language are its provenance and historical context, which follow in the section below. Because of the inconclusive knowledge about significant details on Pramoedya’s life and work between 1959-1961, this section is also a chronology of sorts, beginning with the first appearance of Hoa Kiau until the end of his resulting imprisonment in 1961. It was only a few months after his release that he began editing the cultural page Lentera in the independent national daily Bintang Timur for which he has become notorious. On the whole, his development as an artist and public figure requires more analyses of short spans such as the one I propose here because the late 1950s and early 1960s were a time of great flux and Pramoedya’s personal and intellectual development went through more changes than is frequently assumed.

  

Background and chronology — 1959-1961

  

The book was a revised and expanded publication of a long epistolary essay that was serialised in Bintang Minggu, the Sunday edition of Bintang Timur. The letters addressed to “Ch. Hs-y in P” were written to counter Presidential Regulation (Peraturan Presiden) No. 10 of 1959 (abbreviated as PP-10/1959) which forced all Chinese retail traders in rural areas to close down their businesses by 1 January 1960. Later, they were reproduced fully or in part by other dailies, no less than ten in all of Indonesia with a readership of at least two million. Besides the Indonesian press, translations were distributed abroad by foreign news services. Based on the obvious demand for knowledge of Chinese Indonesian history, Pramoedya produced the book version within the short space of three weeks with the help of numerous others. Ten thousand copies were printed and adapted translations into Chinese appeared in Indonesia, Burma, Cambodia and China.⁸

  

Pramoedya’s letters to “Ch. Hs-Y in P” began to appear in Bintang Minggu in November 1959.⁹ I estimate that these letters appeared in some twelve to sixteen weekly instalments for a four or five month span, until the end of February or the beginning of March 1960. The letters thus appeared in print during the period which witnessed the signing of PP-10/1959 by Soekarno on 16 November 1959 and the height of the domestic and international crises this measure provoked. While the measure was designed to put an end to most kinds of rural retail trade in the hands of Chinese, it was left to local military commanders to decide if a presidential ban was also necessary in the interest of security.¹⁰ Only Colonel Kosasih, the military commander of West Java, in defiance of Soekarno’s wishes, imposed the presidential ban and began forced removals of Chinese traders from villages under his command. Lack of immediate compliance was dealt with ruthlessly:

  

[The army] literally threw hundreds of Chinese families into trucks and took them to hastily constructed relocation camps. Not infrequently, resistance met with harsh treatment.¹¹

  

Colonel Kosasih’s actions disrupted Soekarno’s efforts to maintain good diplomatic relations with China by applying pressure in favour of a milder PP-10/1959 in the weeks leading up to its formulation. The colonel’s actions had been so provocative that the Chinese embassy in Jakarta contravened his directive by asking the Chinese under his command to remain in their homes until Beijing found a solution to their predicament. Embassy personnel began to intervene directly in defence of the Chinese who were being evicted. Such dramatic actions taken by a foreign power on Indonesian soil provoked a nationalist fury that forced Soekarno to become less conciliatory toward China. He backed the army when its commanders evicted the respective Chinese consuls in Selatpanjang, Sumatra and Samarinda, Kalimantan in April 1960. It was not until July 1960 in Cimahi, when Kosasih’s soldiers shot and killed two Chinese women who resisted eviction that Soekarno found the opportunity to rebuke the army leadership by transferring the colonel to a Sumatran command. What appeared to be an attempt by the army to disrupt the good relations Indonesia had enjoyed with China through the 1950s was put to an end. Formally, diplomatic relations improved only in April 1961, when the Chinese Foreign Minister visited Indonesia.¹²

  

Against this politically fraught climate, each segment of Pramoedya’s long letters appeared in the front page and announced itself as part of a series for “Ch. Hs-Y in P”. The abbreviated name was recognisably Chinese and it would not have been hard for readers to guess that “P” stood for Peking. Indeed, anyone who had followed Pramoedya’s career and writings since 1956 knew of his admiration and fascination with China. And “Ch. Hs-Y” was none other than the Chen Xiaru, whom Pramoedya had noted in a caption to her picture in 1957 as the twenty-five year old translator from Malay into Chinese of Salah Asoehan, the novel by Abdoel Moeis published in 1928.¹³ Only a few months earlier, in 1956, he had been invited by the Chinese Writers’ Union to attend a commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the death of the Chinese writer Lu Xun. It was on this trip that Pramoedya met Chen in her capacity as Indonesian language interpreter for the Writers’ Union.¹⁴ She also accompanied him in this capacity throughout his second trip to China in 1958 after attending the first Asia-Africa Writers Conference in Tashkent. Upon his return to Indonesia after his first visit, he told a reporter how impressed he was by Chen’s ability to translate Salah Asoehan, especially since she had completed her study of the language at Peking University only two years earlier and never had been to Indonesia.¹⁵

  

Friendship may have blossomed into love between Pramoedya and Chen following the weeks of intimate contact they experienced during the 1958 trip. Bahrum Rangkuti makes this claim in his fine and informative 1963 publication, the only Indonesian-language book devoted to Pramoedya’s life and work. He believes they eventually came to the realisation that “the interests of two people ought to be surrendered in the name of the well-being of family and nation”.¹⁶ Then, he asserts, they carried on a remarkably active life of correspondence in which they analysed literature, culture and life’s meaning. Pramoedya’s published letters to Chen may well have grown out of such a correspondence as they constitute a serious intellectual engagement about a range of social, economic and cultural issues. And the assertion of love between the two remains intriguing even though unsubstantiated. Nevertheless, the language of the published letters makes the need for further evidence superfluous for it reveals an intimacy between the two.

  

Pramoedya provoked his readers when he published his illuminations of Chinese Indonesian history and culture and addressed them familiarly to a woman in China. As they appeared in Bintang Minggu or in book form later, these letters did not shy from engaging the politics and terror of anti-Chinese policies and their exponents. On the whole, the substance of the epistolary essay is sharply critical of these policies and alternately lively and bookish in its historical analyses. There were notable differences between the newspaper serialisation and the book. Besides reaching a much wider audience, the newspaper provided a venue for the immediacy of photographs as well as timely and biting headlines that were omitted in book form. The photograph accompanying one installment carries this pithy caption:

  

A common suffering caused the elimination of boundaries between peoples and groups. In Surabaya at the start of the Revolution, Chinese struggled shoulder to shoulder with Indonesians.¹⁷

  

On a more studious note, photographs of a cannon and flame-carrying arrow in another segment show advances in Chinese weaponry in the premodern era.¹⁸ On the other hand, provocative headlines such as this were aimed at those groups fanning the flames of anti-Chinese politics: “Only a bizarre people do not know to be thankful”.¹⁹ Corresponding to the Letter Six in the book, Pramoedya titles a revised and expanded version of the same instalment more soberly: “The contribution of Hoakiau to Indonesia’s progress”.²⁰ While the many changes Pramoedya made in the book were intended to polish and further document his analyses, some names were omitted possibly for fear of military retaliation. Jusuf Abdullah Puar, who obliquely accused Pramoedya of obscuring the role of Chinese as agents of Beijing in Indonesia is mentioned by name in a newspaper instalment, but only as a well-known former nominee for the post of Minister of Information in the book.²¹

  

Between the Bintang Minggu instalments and the publication of Hoa Kiau, Pramoedya’s letters to Chen were given considerable exposure. Although I have not determined the date of its banning, the military’s interdiction took place soon after the appearance of the book, perhaps around April 1960. From a series of articles he wrote of a two-month trip abroad, we know that he was in Bombay and Cairo some time in July and August; there may have been a trip to China, too.²² Then, a sign that the long silence of 1960 spelled trouble was expressed in January 1961 through a series of articles dealing with the life and work of Pramoedya by A. Sibarani, the caricaturist.²³ While these articles were indeed about Sibarani’s personal knowledge of Pramoedya as well as his estimation of the writer in an age of internationalism, he hints at larger problems surrounding Pramoedya through a critique of the rumours about the author’s opposition to Soekarno’s political programme, Guided Democracy, and the terrible treason of writing Hoa Kiau. What these articles tell us is that Pramoedya had truly hit a raw nerve in Indonesia and the rumours of his abandonment of Guided Democracy – he and other artists had supported this programme from its inception – and Hoa Kiau became signs of his betrayal of the nation. The particulars of his treatment by the military that follow give further evidence of how marginalised he had become, and how alone he was in his predicament. The attack on him was not part of a larger political purge or cultural movement but as Keith Foulcher notes, “it indicated the increasingly volatile climate in which Indonesian cultural politics were now being conducted”.²⁴

  

Pramoedya was on his trip abroad in 1960 when he heard about the banning of Hoa Kiau. Upon his return, he was summoned by Penguasa Perang Tertinggi (usually abbreviated to Peperti, Supreme Battle Command) to furnish a statement. Following an interrogation by Major Sudharmono, he was not allowed to return home and held for two months in Rumah Tahanan Militer (henceforth RTM, Military Detention Centre) in Jakarta. Then, after a second interrogation by Sudharmono, he was either accused of planning an escape or creating a disturbance, and punished by being sent to Cipinang Prison. Maemunah, Pramoedya’s wife, was in an advanced stage of pregnancy and completely in the dark about his whereabouts during the early weeks of the detention. When she finally learned what had happened, she made the news of his detention known to his readers through a birth announcement in a newspaper. The press, including Radio Australia, learned of his detention at this time and its releases played a role in his removal from RTM to Cipinang. Only in this prison did Pramoedya receive an arrest warrant issued by General A. H. Nasution, ironically the same man who, in 1958, sent the author a letter of appreciation for aiding the army effort to put down the rebellion in West Sumatra. From the memoirs Pramoedya kept of his time in prison, we know that he had been transferred to Cipinang by February 1961. He recalls his time here as one of the most bitter experiences of his life. For much of the rest of this year, he was placed in an extremely unsanitary cell behind double doors in a cell-block whose inmates were mostly psychologically disturbed. Telling much about the degree to which he had been marginalised, his passport was seized this year and when he was released, it was with traitors to the nation – prisoners from the failed Permesta rebellions in Sulawesi and Sumatra. His name was mentioned in the same breath as these rebels in the following day’s newspaper. At least until early November he was under house arrest as revealed in a written interview with him conducted by K. H. Ramadhan on the subject of Kartini. For one whole year between 1960 and close to the end of 1961, Pramoedya was held in RTM, Cipinang Prison, and then placed under house arrest followed by town arrest. Throughout this time, he was held without trial and not given a chance to defend himself.²⁵

  

Pramoedya’s kidnapping and prison experience are signs enough of the terror of the times, but another indicator is the silence, the absence of a polemic about Hoa Kiau, let alone a defence of the author. Newspapers were routinely closed down by military censors for publishing unacceptable articles, including Bintang Timur itself from early February 1960 for an indefinite period.²⁶ And the language in which political problems were raised was indirect. For instance, the above mentioned three-part article by Sibarani was written with an awareness of Pramoedya’s unexplained absence if not the kidnapping itself, and to counter the insidious rumours that were circulating about the author. However, no mention is made of his predicament except to stress that a writer’s most ardent desire is ‘freedom for himself’!²⁷ Further, besides Maemunah’s use of the birth announcement to make public Pramoedya’s detention, in another announcement on the occasion of Lebaran, the feast at the end of the Muslim fasting month, she expressed thanks on behalf of the author to delegations from the cultural, arts, literary, peasant, youth and labour organisations, to individuals who personally expressed sympathies to the family and approached official agencies in the author’s interest as well as to various local and foreign bodies who conveyed their sympathies.²⁸ Only in a single deft reference near the end was any mention made of her husband’s detention. Here, she thanks friends, comrades, neighbours and relatives who looked after them “the whole time my husband has not been at home”.

  

Pramoedya has asserted the centrality of the military’s role in carrying out terror campaigns as opposed to Soekarno because it was the former who held effective territorial control.²⁹ And since the introduction of martial law in 1957 as a result of the rise of regional rebellions, the army’s role had suddenly expanded “not only in politics but also in the broader fields of general administration and economic management”.³⁰ Some of the ways in which the growing power of the army impinged on Pramoedya, Hoa Kiau, and civil life in general have been illustrated in this section. I have asserted here that he became marginalised, at least in public life and politics. Privately and by informal means, Pramoedya had many supporters as we know from Maemunah’s announcement as well as the memoirs of a Chinese Indonesian who personally met with her a number of times, bearing the sympathy and gifts of the organisation BAPERKI (Badan Permusjawaratan Kewarganegaraan Indonesia, Consultative Body for Indonesian Citizenship).³¹ On the other hand, the army demonstrated their antipathy toward the author and Hoa Kiau and exercised to the fullest their extraordinary authority under martial law. The army took what they regarded as the ‘Chinese problem’ very seriously as we know from the existence of a restricted 160-page intelligence report produced in 1961 that was the only substantial Indonesian-language work on Chinese Indonesians at the time other than Hoa Kiau; oddly enough it was the latter’s counterpart.³² But it seems also that the harsh treatment of Pramoedya by the army may have indirect if not direct links with his marginalisation by other figures in the cultural politics of the time. In an exchange of letters in Bintang Timur between Pramoedya and a certain Bokor Hutahasut, a friend of the literary critic H. B. Jassin, more than three years after the appearance of Hoa Kiau, we learn of the remarkable degree to which Hoa Kiau had upset at least some intellectuals and artists.³³ Read as an offence to the Indonesian nation and the Revolution, the book affected them viscerally; its worth as a sympathetic critique of nation and an illumination of the racist nature of PP-10/1959 was lost on them. It was as if they shared the feelings of the junior army officer who, when interrogating Pramoedya at RTM, accused him of having “sold our state to the PRC [People’s Republic of China]” by writing Hoa Kiau.³⁴ What was it about the language of this book that upset people so much?

  

Language

  

Hoa Kiau illuminates the deeper levels of significance to the crisis in Indonesia wrought by PP-10/1959. Its language may be seen as an expression of the voice of the nation talking back to the power of an encroaching state. While Pramoedya no doubt was concerned about the plight of the Chinese, the attacks on them were but signs of a larger menace: the growth of a powerful modern army and state apparatus as well as a repressive bureaucratic language. Hinting at the rising language of official nationalism, he begins his first letter to Chen Xiaru with these words: “If only [we] look at official reality (so cynical these words: official reality!), we live today in a modern age”. One can hear the distant voice and expectations of Kartini, writing also to a friend abroad, behind these words, for when she wrote her first letter to her Dutch pen pal, she says: “I have so desired to make an acquaintance with a modern girl”. When Kartini’s voice expresses wonderment at the dawning of the modern age, Pramoedya expresses profound disappointment and anger about the meaning of modernity in his time. Hinting at his own historically rooted vision of progress, he chides those for whom being modern meant proudly “becoming a part of this age, and viewing the ages before it as a wasted [effort] that was probably ridiculous, probably even saddening too”. Pramoedya notes, while the modern era brought much that is good to humanity, paradoxically humanity itself is in danger so long as “there are human beings who wish not to live as human beings, but as animals”. The first paragraph of Hoa Kiau ends with these words: “Thus emerges this terror and that terror”.³⁵

  

The equation of modernity not with the promise of the future but with terror sets the tone of Hoa Kiau. However, he reminds the reader that the darkness now descended on Indonesia came about “only as a result of a social system and structure that allowed opportunities for violations against humanity to happen”.³⁶ In the following quote, he hints at who may be responsible for the present predicament as well as a way out:

  

But sometimes a people [bangsa] or a nation [nasion] produces so few leaders or even no leaders at all, just merely big shots and autocrats, to the point that animal instincts come to the fore again! Under these conditions, we can do no more than dream of a better world, and we fight for that dream until it becomes reality.³⁷

  

In Hoa Kiau, the dream is expressed in a language and history that probes the soulless and agency-less language of bureaucracy, preventing it from becoming normal or natural. The construction of this dream was founded on his use of particular words as well as addressing his letters to Chen. Here, I wish turn to these two aspects of Hoa Kiau.

  

Pramoedya’s linguistic innovations grew out of a unique appreciation of history. Hoa Kiau grew out of the historical research Pramoedya had begun since the 1950s, resulting also in his 1962 work Panggil Aku Kartini Sadja [Just Call Me Kartini] and other shorter essays. Thus, while the Hoa Kiau letters appear spontaneous and ad hoc, the language and analysis is the result of much thought concerning the nature of the modern Indonesian nation-state and its colonial past. Also, in the 1950s, he had begun research on Melayu-Tionghoa (Malay-Chinese) literature from the turn of the century, thus restoring a vital and lively ancestor of modern Indonesian and a genre dismissed by the scholars Jassin and Teeuw.³⁸ As Dutch lost relevance with the downfall of the colonial power, Pramoedya observes how Melayu-Tionghoa, “this mixed-bag language which is strange, satisfying and plastic” began to “influence ‘official’ Indonesian language”.³⁹ Besides contributing significantly to the birth of a national language, Malay-speaking Chinese communities, the author notes at some length, were important in the making of Indonesian culture.⁴⁰

  

Against the climate of terror and the bureaucratic death involving Chinese Indonesians that seemed to have gripped the minds of many, he had to find a new and strange language to convey his own perspective. In this regard his choice of the word Hoakiau is revealing. Although it was in some use at the time, its absence from every major dictionary of the period suggests that as an Indonesian word it was of recent vintage.⁴¹ Pramoedya indicates his awareness of the word’s original meaning, ‘Overseas Chinese’, and knew of its origins in the language of the Chinese state in the early part of this century. As China pursued a foreign policy that courted Chinese populations long established overseas – ‘discovering’ the Chinese abroad so to speak – the term Hoakiau, ‘Sojourning Chinese’ was coined.⁴² So why does he deliberately use the word to mean ‘Chinese’?⁴³

  

Hoakiau, though in use at the time, was less common than Tionghoa and semantically devoid of ‘Chineseness’ in comparison to the latter or Cina. Its sound still had an element of strangeness to Indonesian ears. It was also least used in derogatory terms, hence one said ‘Chinaman’ in the following ways, dasar Tionghoa or dasar Cina, but not dasar Hoakiau. Similarly, one spoke of Chinese descent as keturunan Tionghoa or keturunan Cina, but not keturunan Hoa Kiau; the last is a strange category that is conceptual in some respects and cannot regenerate.⁴⁴ Pramoedya’s choice of Hoakiau then, was deliberately intended to make his readers rethink the meaning and sound of ‘Chinese’. Against the neat definition of Chinese that was constructed by the state and which gave definition to anti-Chinese actions, Pramoedya suggested anew that the strangeness of the Chinese was not so neatly defined, and even partly contained within ‘us’ Indonesians. For him Hoakiau “are native Indonesians with Chinese customs and norms”.⁴⁵

  

Pramoedya’s central focus in his book is an exploration of the dimensions of kepribadiaan, incompletely translated as the ‘self’ of the nasion. So he claims: “Revolution is not uncivilized killing, it contains a noble charge, but all the more so it means composing the self”.⁴⁶ The latter is an innovative use of an English word to critique, rethink and expand the older notion of nation in common use around 1960: Bangsa. Nasion allows Pramoedya to provide an alternative and more inclusive vision of what constitutes Indonesia. It is revealing of the lack of development in the conceptualisation of the modern Indonesian nation that nasional (national) in things pertaining to the nation like revolusi nasional (national revolution), perpustakaan nasional (national library) and so on was in use, but not nasion.⁴⁷ And since the latter part of the 1950s, the term pengusaha nasional (national businessmen) came to apply only to ‘native’ Indonesians who, in another significant invention of that era, came to be regarded as ‘economically weaker’ in comparison to ‘foreign’ businessmen; this is the language in which the text of PP-10/1959 is constructed.⁴⁸ In the text, owners who were asing (foreign) and rural businesses of a ‘foreign character’ (bersifat asing) were to be transferred to national businessmen.

  

The economic nationalism of this language first emerged in relation to the foreign ownership of businesses in Dutch hands. The nationalisation in 1957 of the businesses of the former coloniser fit nicely with the struggle for national independence and the foreigner in question was named. On the other hand, PP-10/1959, which may be seen as a more advanced phase of economic nationalism, described the ‘foreign’ without giving it a name, though it was marked ‘Chinese’ in insidious ways. By law, PP-10/1959 applied to those who had not opted to become Indonesian citizens, but in fact, it was applied for the most part to everyone considered ‘Chinese’. Leaving this group unnamed however, was an indication of the ambivalence about the nation. And it is here that the character and tone of language in Hoa Kiau becomes a powerful and evocative vehicle for rubbing the history of Chinese Indonesians against the grain. When unnamed, this foreign category was estranged and mistreated. Pramoedya was aware that he was living in times when there was a process at work, by economic, political and cultural means that was ‘making’ the Chinese.⁴⁹ His struggle in Hoa Kiau was to find a language to counter this process of making Chinese foreign and taking their voice away in more than simple legalistic ways. He had to come up with a language that provided room for a historical reading of the nation in which Chinese were strangers who were not foreign. His exploration of the nation’s kepribadiaan was nowhere better captured that in the construction of the epistolary essay around a Chinese woman in China.

  

Against the xenophobic climate of the times, Pramoedya makes a metaphorical gesture to Chen Xiaru that is highly charged politically and sexually.

  

Take my outstretched hand. We will not forget anything in this our lives, and we will pass our jottings to our children and grandchildren, to history.⁵⁰

  

There is never an explicit reference to a real or imagined sexual intimacy between the two besides the chatty intimacy in the language of the Hoa Kiau letters. Pramoedya does, however, subtly eroticise the relationship when he speaks of ‘our children’ and the ‘history’ produced by their union. This metaphor of union serves well also for the history of Chinese Indonesians. And Pramoedya thereby suggests as he does in numerous ways throughout the text, that the union of Chinese with the Indonesian nation is one so intimate that an attempt to estrange the former is injurious to national identity.⁵¹

  

Pramoedya himself makes the choice of writing to Chen seem like a mere coincidence. We think of him sitting at his typewriter, burdened by PP-10/1959, and asking himself “Who can I speak with?” So he says to Chen: “I must speak, and it is really coincidental that it is you that I chose”.⁵² Letter-writing is a private, even intimate activity, and indeed he hints at this at a few junctures. So when he constructs his letters for a national daily with her in mind, it is a meaningful act, it is a means of identifying personal solidarities with public ones. There is an intimacy as well as the camaraderie of international solidarity between them: “You know my position; and it is not I alone who hold to a position such as this”.⁵³ By writing to her, he displayed openly his isolation in Indonesia – there were not Indonesians he could write to, perhaps because anti-Chinese xenophobia had become so deep-rooted. Every time her name appears, “Hs-y,” at the start of a letter, at a pause or transition in the text, it is a reminder of his camaraderie and intimacy with a Chinese woman far away. But it was also a way of speaking to Indonesians. Writing to Chen was like writing to an outsider about all the most intimate affairs of one’s own house. The letters presented a dialogue between Pramoedya and Chen, like a drama – Indonesians reading these letters in newspapers were like a vast audience scattered throughout the land. Besides being an admission of his isolation during this xenophobic time, he also meant to provoke his readership.

  

There is something deeply personal that he conveys about his desire to write about the Chinese and how it is connected to his craft. There is also a courage that comes out of his belief that no power is able stop anyone, not just a writer, from expressing his deepest feelings.⁵⁴ It is worthwhile to look in this instance at a substantial excerpt from the beginning of Letter Three written late in 1959, shortly before the 1 January 1960 deadline for the closure of Chinese retail shops in the countryside:

  

On this night which is enveloped by the atmosphere of Christmas and the coming of the New Year, my heart feels truly moved to be able to speak with my own soul – a soul that for some time recently has been upset by the agitation about the Hoakiau problem. There is not a force on this earth that can stop a person from speaking with his own soul. As it happens, I am a writer, and so I will try to write down my feelings, my thoughts, my knowledge about this Hoakiau problem. Possibly other people will ask, why does this problem attract and disturb my soul so much. That I shall not deny! First of all, because my feeling of humanism is offended, second because I prefer being friends with the peoples of all countries, and third because I too may could not deny if it were said that it is possible I have Chinese blood flowing in me. And Hs-y, there is nothing more precious in this life than friendship, because it gives our life so much greater breadth. It is only enmity that narrows life.⁵⁵

  

When Pramoedya rather flirtatiously says “I prefer being friends with the peoples of all countries”, once again, he rubs against the grain of the polarised international solidarities of the time. At the same time he drowns the many critics of his publicly stated fondness for China by unabashedly admitting that he found so much to admire in that country and its people.⁵⁶

  

The dialogue with an outsider was a means of illuminating the centrality of Chineseness in Indonesia. By placing the conversation and comparison on the scale of the historically formed nation-states of Indonesia and China, he was able to show how familiar in fact the Chinese were to the Indonesian nation. Cast in the language of psychoanalytic theory, it was a means of recognising the stranger, the Chinese, as part of the self, the nation.⁵⁷ Engaging as Pramoedya does with the political, historical and cultural body of the nation, he had to create a language that was able to illuminate anew the familiarity of Chinese to Indonesia. This meant taking on an increasingly strong bureaucratic complacency that was cast in revolutionary rhetoric. A bureaucratic-revolutionary language had assumed the task of continuing the Indonesian revolution – as Soekarno urged, thereby defining the substance of nationalism and modernity around 1960. This bureaucratic language had set about making ‘natural’ the foreignness of Chinese that had been asserted in political life for less than a decade. And so it is at this ‘cynical’ language that Pramoedya launches his very first criticisms in an attempt to create his own sense of a national space and modernity.

  

Conclusion

  

More than 100,000 Chinese left Indonesia during 1960-1961 as result of PP-10/1959 and typically ended up experiencing hardship because of problems that emerged on the one hand, from the political intrigues of the Indonesian and Chinese states, and on the other, because of the rise of terror within Indonesia’s own boundaries. Pramoedya frequently emphasises that his principal reason for writing Hoa Kiau was to point to out that nothing short of an economic programme as opposed to a mere shift in personnel would improve the lot of ‘native’ Indonesian businessmen. PP-10/1959 was a bad policy in his eyes because it only switched one class of businessmen, the Chinese traders, with another, the ‘native’ businessmen.⁵⁸ However, as we have seen, the book certainly does not only provide an economic counter argument.

  

One of the problems of the 1960s was the defensive, party-based responses and attacks that created highly polarised groups, and in some ways were responsible for the rise of the ‘Chinese problem’. It was a time when people were compelled to organise culturally and politically along the schisms that had been created in public life. And the moment the PKI or Soekarno entered the fray to defend the Chinese, they inevitably accepted the terms of the debate – the existence of a reified notion of alien Chinese. Pramoedya did not accept these terms. He started afresh by historicising Chineseness, being sensitive both to the internal national terrain and external political changes, principally the rise of China as a world power. However, he was targeted because he had taken on a far bigger challenge, ‘Indonesia’, and in his historical critique, transgressed the boundaries created by the rhetoric of Soekarno or any political party of his day.

  

In linking himself intimately with Chen, Pramoedya overturns the purist self-love of Indonesian nationalism by flaunting a dangerous miscegenistic flirtation. He does the same in suggesting that he too cannot be certain of not possessing Chinese blood and hence cannot promote anti-Chineseness. To combat the saliency, embodiment and naturalness of Indonesian racial purity, he proposes a miscegenistic reading, and put his own body on the line. Thus he provoked those who fanned anti-Chinese politics. Implicitly, he asked them: can you be sure not to have any Chinese blood? In Hoa Kiau, it is the very powerful and appealing corporeal notion of purity and power that he dangerously transgresses by asserting that Chinese blood flows through the Indonesian body.

THE CHINESE IN INDONESIA 

## Letter One

  

## Limited and Universal Humanism

  

Hs-y,

  

If only we look at the official reality (so cynical these words: official reality!), we live today in a modern age. Many people feel proud that they are part of this modern era and look back on past eras as strange, lost times, perhaps even tragic, pathetic times. Yes, and I, too, must admit that this modern age has contributed much to humanity. But even today, humanity itself remains under threat, as long as and while ever there are human beings who prefer to live as beasts rather than as human beings. And the strange thing is that it is human beings themselves – the only force that can actually defend a humane civilisation – who often forget that they are human beings. The task of developing humanity is often betrayed by human beings themselves. Thus emerges this terror and that terror.

  

You and I and everybody know that this type of phenomenon occurs because the prevailing social system and structure provide the opportunity for such violations against humanity. In my paper before the Peace Conference in Bandung, 25-31 January 1960, with the theme ‘Cultural Cooperation to Consolidate World Peace’, I wrote:

  

There is a dogma among statesmen: If you want a place in history or at least to achieve contemporary popularity, there are two courses you can follow. You can destroy your superiors or eliminate some group or minority in society.

  

And you, too, should be able to find examples of what I mean, either in local or world history, especially in the history of all those pointless and confused feudal wars.

  

But I am fortunate in that humanity has been included as one of the principles of the [Indonesian] State – humanity is one of the five principles: Pancasila¹! The recent disbanding of the Constituent Assembly because of its failure to understand Pancasila confirms for me once again that the social system and structure that prevail in Indonesia are not capable of giving humanity the primary position it should have. But be careful here: this does not mean that the struggle for humanity has stopped in Indonesia. If the struggle for humanity arrives at some finishing point, then that will signal the end of the history of humanity itself on this earth. On this beloved Indonesian earth. In the struggle to defend humanity, nothing should be feared, because to be cowed by an enemy of humanity is the same as accepting death itself, a death without honour, a pointless death.

  

Hs-y, from what I have written so far, I hope that it will be clear to you what my starting point is, what my framework is, and what my basic reasoning is when I analyse the issue of the Chinese in Indonesia, especially in relation to PP 10² – yes, an official product of the nation in 1959! (What a cynical term: official product!) For me, no matter what the situation, no matter what difficulty the national economy may be experiencing, there is no excuse for people turning into barbarians. Humanity cannot be bought with money, and so we cannot just put it away into our pockets because our stomachs are empty or there is no rice in the storehouse. Humanity must be guarded no matter how bad the social, economic, or political situation may be. The deterioration of a humane culture into some kind of rotten social intercourse is also a sign of shallowness of character, not only as a nation but at the individual level as well. And a nation that can so easily abandon humanity can easily lose its way in the course of its historical development.

  

Hs-y, Indonesia is a country where a majority of the population is Muslim. I think it is worth mentioning the opinion of the second most important person in Islam, namely Al Imam Ali:

  

All creatures are the servants of God. And the servants of God who are the most beloved of God are those who make a positive contribution towards others who are His creatures.

  

And who was Al Imam Ali? None other than the Caliph to the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, and the second most important Muslim. He was so highly esteemed that the Prophet is said to have decreed that to look upon the face of Ali is a form of worship itself and that whomsoever disturbs Ali, so he also disturbs the Prophet himself.

  

Hs-y, how beautiful the world would be if all the good teachings of good leaders are actually carried out. But sometimes a nation produces so few leaders or perhaps even no leaders at all, just merely big shots and autocrats, to the point that bestial instincts come to the fore again! Under such conditions, we can do no more than dream of a better world and we fight for that dream until it becomes a reality.

  

About Limited Humanity

  

Hs-y, I have tried to explain my outlook on humankind and humanity. It reminds me of an acquaintance who used to visit my house, although I have not seen him for some time now. Whenever the discussion turned to humankind and humanity, he would start to complain. “Abstract! Nonsense! Unproductive! Not creative! This kind of talk will not produce a single cent!” he would say. Ah yes, if everything could be measured in money, how easy it would be to organise human beings as if they were nothing more than commodities. This kind of dangerous thinking must be destroyed, removed, and defeated from the outset. So he has never come to my home again.

  

But in defending humanity, there is another aspect that is no less important: What do we all actually mean by the word ‘humanity’? Ways of viewing humanity are sometimes very different, even contradictory, even though human beings are the same everywhere. They feel pain if it is inflicted, they die if they are killed, and they shed tears and have a nervous system. We are the same! Just as Al Imam Ali said. But the attitude a people displays towards humanity can reveal what stage of development in their own humanity that they have reached.

  

In their book about Albert Schweitzer, Charles R. Joy and Melvin Arnold wrote of how Schweitzer came across certain tribes in Lambaréné, in the heart of Africa that did not understand that people from other tribes experienced pain if a tree branch fell on them. Such tribes only knew that members of their own tribe felt pain if such a thing befell them. It is a phenomenon similar to when ants on a trail continue their march even though others of their kind right next to them are being squashed under the boot of somebody. So, Hs-y, in such cases we are dealing with humanity (or is it animality?) that is not yet universal, a tribal humanity, a humanity of the group. In the world of commerce and business, we come across the term ‘Limited’ or ‘Ltd’. This is a kind of limited humanity.

  

This limited humanity has a long and varied history in human evolution. Indonesian cultural anthropologists have provided lots of clear data about societies isolated from progress (see also Dr. H. Th. Fischer, Introduction to Indonesian Cultural Anthropology). If we want to go international a little, we can study Gordon Childe’s book about the rise of civilisation (Man Makes Himself). This limited humanity is the attitude displayed by one group or section of humanity in its approach to other groups of humans that are alien, that they do not know, or do not wish to or are too lazy to know. This is similar to how a dog might relate to another dog with which it is not familiar. Of course such an attitude is unworthy of any people, nation or individual. The times do not allow for such an attitude. Human evolution and the evolution of societies and peoples have come too far. Knowledge of the different peoples has spread far and wide so that there is no excuse any more for somebody to say that they do not know or understand a particular people. Impossible! In fact, today in all countries where there are progressive individuals, there are institutions promoting relations between nations and cultures. There are now many treaties covering cultural exchanges. History no longer allows us the space to return to limited humanity.

  

Hs-y, it is a pity that I have not read Schweitzer’s The Philosophy of Civilisation. As someone who had mixed a great deal with primitive and small-scale civilisations that represent the great eras of past times, he must have written much about these issues. But I am not going to try to discuss with you things about which I know little about, except to ask questions. The real issue is that there are now a number of big shots and officials who, because of their inability to understand the history of human evolution, have been trapped in that anachronism called limited humanity. Such officials are no more than the remnant representatives of an uncivilised era.

  

But let us first look at another very typical example of limited humanity.

  

The Jews: An Example of the Victims of Limited Humanity

  

Hs-y, we know from history why the Jewish people were expelled from their own country. The wanderings of the Jews are an epic itself from European history, at least as told by W. Durant in his book The Story of Philosophy. He wrote:

  

Driven from their natural home by the Roman capture of Jerusalem (70 AD), and scattered by flight and trade among all the nations and to all the continents; persecuted and decimated by the adherents of the great religions – Christianity and Mohammedanism – which had been born of their scriptures and their memories; barred by the feudal system from owning land, and by the guilds from taking part in industry; shut up within congested ghettoes and narrowing pursuits, mobbed by the people and robbed by the kings; building with their finance and trade the towns and cities indispensable to civilisation; outcast and excommunicated, insulted and injured; – yet, without any political structure, without any legal compulsion to social unity, without even a common language, this wonderful people has maintained itself in body and soul, has preserved its racial and cultural integrity, has guarded with jealous love its oldest rituals and traditions, has patiently and resolutely awaited the day of its deliverance...

  

But, Hs-y, one thing that is even more relevant to our discussion is their wanderings. After the fall of their holy city, they dispersed. They travelled through Tyre, Sidon and other port cities, spreading throughout the Mediterranean region, reaching Athens, Antioch, Alexandria, Carthage, Rome, Marseilles, and even to the Iberian Peninsula. It was as if, after the destruction of their temple, a wholesale transporting of their people took place. They finally went in two directions. The first wave went along the Danube and Rhine to make their way into Poland and Russia. The others made their way to Portugal and Spain, following in the wake of the victorious Moors (711 AD). The Jews in Central Europe became renowned as traders and bankers. On the Iberian Peninsula they mastered the knowledge of medicines that originated with the Arabs as well as mathematics, philosophy and the heritage of their own culture. This knowledge was taught in the great schools of Cordova, Barcelona and Seville.

  

Both their puritan outlook and their skills developed in response to the barbaric repression they experienced in their new homelands. They had been forced to flee to Portugal and Spain after Rome (which itself had been strengthened by the contributions of the Jews and by the spread of the Christian religion) started to persecute them in the same way that the Christians had been persecuted before they achieved state power. Rome later fell, and Spain and Portugal rose up. W. Durant went on to write:

  

The Jews of Spain prospered and flourished until the conquest of Granada by Ferdinand in 1492 and the final expulsion of the Moors. The Peninsular Jews now lost the liberty which they had enjoyed under the lenient ascendancy of Islam; the Inquisition swept down upon them with the choice of baptism and the practice of Christianity or exile and the confiscation of their goods. It was not that the Church was violently hostile to the Jews – the popes repeatedly protested against the barbarities of the Inquisition; but the King of Spain thought he might fatten his purse with the patiently-garnered wealth of this alien race. Almost in the year that Columbus discovered America, Ferdinand discovered the Jews.

  

The great majority of Jews accepted their harder alternative and looked about them for a place of refuge. Some took ship and sought entry into Genoa and other Italian ports; they were refused, and sailed on in growing misery and disease till they reached the coast of Africa, where many of them were murdered for the jewels they were believed to have swallowed. A few were received into Venice, which knew how much of its maritime ascendancy it owed to its Jews. Others financed the voyage of Columbus, a man perhaps of their own race, hoping that the great Navigator would find them a new home. A large number of them embarked in the frail vessels of that day and sailed up the Atlantic, between hostile England and hostile France, to find at last some measure of welcome in little big-souled Holland…

  

Thereafter Spain decayed, and Holland prospered...The Jews were happy now, if we may judge from the stout content of the merchants and rabbis to whom Rembrandt has given immortality.

  

And so it was that the fate of Spain was decided. Its greatness collapsed, and Holland developed as the next strong state in Europe. It was from Holland that the Jewish people then spread to other places in Western Europe.

  

The rise and fall of these states were not, of course, determined by the arrival and departure of the Jewish people. As a grouping or a people, they have no supernatural powers. The secret of this phenomenon is to be found in the strengths that the Jewish people had that were not to be found among the indigenous people at that time. They were puritan in the traditional sense, that is, they worked hard and were thrifty. This meant that there was an increase in the production of goods and services and the accumulation of new capital, all of which strengthened the societies where they were based. Their puritanism resulted in these societies becoming richer and stronger.

  

If I mention here these historical examples without giving all the dates and so on, it is not because I am trying to play up to the Jewish people or have become a champion of Zionism. We must have the courage to see the facts of history and learn from them, because history has been written so that we can learn from it and not just run from it.

  

It should not surprise us that the Jewish people are often described in Western literature as stingy bloodsuckers and asocial. First, the feudal-bourgeois structures of society at the time were incapable of giving this group an equal place, so that they could not find a way to contribute directly to a society that did not acknowledge them. Second, too many people suffer from a stunted spirit where they seek out only the bad points of other people rather than acknowledge that such people might have strengths that they themselves do not possess. Can we not all remember how the cleverest of the pupils at school would often be the subject of hate and jealousy from their school friends? At least in the old society?

  

And there is a saying of the old people here: The devil does not want to go to hell by himself; he will bring his friends in indolence along with him. So you can see it is not a question of simply taking sides with the Jews. It is clear that people at that time did not yet possess a universal humanism; it was still a limited humanity, to borrow the term from commercial law. That there were some Jews who were moneylenders – oh, of course there were, there are such types in all societies, East, West, North or South – but such examples cannot be used to define the character of whole groups or societies.

  

The persecution of the Jewish people was caused by the fact that the sense of humanity that prevailed among those societies at that time was still of a limited type. This was no different from the kind of humanity that Charles R. Joy and Melvin Arnold wrote about among one or more of the tribes of the Lambaréné Valley in Africa.

  

If we follow the fate of the Jewish people, we eventually come to the period of Nazi dominance in Germany. It was in this period that for the first time there was a systematic and planned destruction of the Jews, carried out in accordance with the concept of racial superiority as outlined in the Nazi bible composed by Hitler, Mein Kampf. The doctrine of racial superiority was later exposed as bankrupt, empty and false because another race of people was exposed as being capable of evil and inhumanity. The other contradiction in the teachings of Hitler was in the socialism that he created, a socialism based on a German nationalism, which itself was based on prejudice and dogma.

  

We both understand that socialism is the legitimate child of humanity and a humane society or humanism, a concept that stresses a just and equal distribution in the circulation of goods in society, abandoning the emphasis on profits. But with its vision of limited humanity, that is, of Nazi nationalism, such justice was to be only for German citizens, even though other peoples or groups had contributed to German life. This was the contradiction of the socialism of Hitler: nationalism combined with socialism à la Germany and known as Nazism.

  

Limited Humanity as the Source of Racial Discrimination

  

The racial discrimination carried out by the Nazis was a result of the teachings of Hitler about racial superiority and the superiority of the German race, the Aryan race, the Nordic race. Hitler resorted to the use of race as one of the elements of his teachings because, before Bismarck, the German states had not been successful in forging a nation. Even Bismarck was able to gather only three-quarters of the German people under a single banner (R.C.K. Ensor, Herr Hitler’s Self-Disclosure in Mein Kampf). And so he had to use a racial theory to unite the divided German people. But the consequences of using such teachings were wider than predicted: racial discrimination, oppression and murder, in short, the violation of humanity itself. These consequences were so great as to create a state power that brought into being a new mentality that ran counter to all common sense. For example, theft by a German from a German was treated as a more serious crime, with heavier penalties, than theft from a non-German, especially a Jew (J. Walter Jones, The Nazi Conception of Law).

  

The persecution of the Jews in Germany also produced another idea on how to achieve racial purity: eugenics. This theory was more a joke than anything based on serious science. Hitler’s total power resulted in the domestication, or the voluntary domestication, of scholars and scientists. It was only the most courageous of them who, if they were lucky, were able to flee the country; otherwise, they ended up in the death camps. Why were these attempts at racial purity such a joke? Because the reality is that some kind of perfection in body never guarantees perfection of spirit and that even a good soul cannot guarantee that the souls it gives birth to will be as good. The laws of biological descent cannot be controlled by the parties involved, let alone if such efforts are attempted over just one generation. Furthermore, there is the whole question of sociological factors and their development, contacts with foreign countries, public opinion, and so on.

  

In short, any such theories based on race in this modern era are nothing more than some nightmare dreamed up in the middle of the day.

  

Discrimination and Imperialism

  

In the history of humankind, marked by its limited humanity, there has been much discrimination. This discrimination is definitely a negative phenomenon in the human psyche. The Jews experienced injustice in the form of both racial and religious discrimination. In certain periods, the gypsies of Europe also experienced such discrimination. But all forms of discrimination – political, biological, religious, social and economic – are the natural children of imperialism. Imperialism itself is a manifestation of humanity unable to behave and think in accordance with its own humanity.

  

Discrimination today is still rampant in all places. In those countries oppressed by colonialism, the indigenous inhabitants – the legitimate descendants of their own ancestors – are killed and stepped upon and not acknowledged to have any rights. This has been the history of contact between the West and the Afro-Asian peoples for the last four centuries. This has also been the sad story of the Americas since the time they were discovered by Columbus. In South Africa and over the whole continent of Australia, the indigenous people have been destroyed. A colonialised people is synonymous with every kind of discrimination!

  

Every kind of imperialism, whether local or international, always divides society into two groups, oppressor and oppressed. If you cannot find these two groupings, then it means that imperialism has not yet gotten a hold. The oppression is justified through discrimination in every arena.

  

Hs-y, both of our peoples have just emerged from the colonial prison, from twentieth-century imperialism. It is not right that we ourselves spread to other sections of society the very same disease which we have rejected as an enemy of humanity. This is especially the case when we need cooperation, mutual respect and tolerance if we are to defend the national freedom that we have won and for which we have paid such a high price. For this we need competent and wise leaders who have a broad understanding of history, social development and international relations. Good relations between peoples will be endangered if some crossboy or crossgirl³ somehow ends up ruling a state and, as I said in the speech at the Peace Conference in Bandung:

  

Every disorder in a country provides opportunities for crossboys or crossgirls who have also somehow come into power. Then we have the possibility of an international alliance of crossboys and crossgirls.

  

Hs-y, this is not what we need at this time in our history. We, all of us, need more cooperation and mutual understanding. It is no coincidence that Indonesia itself has been the host of the Asia-Africa Conference, which passed a resolution calling for peaceful coexistence between different social systems. Such coexistence must be more than just some label pinned to foreign policy; it must be the spirit of all political activities, domestic and international. I think that every sane mind that has succeeded in shaking itself free of imperial and colonial aspirations will recognise this.

  

We have all rejected colonialism and imperialism, no matter how beautiful a form they may take! And so, too, must we reject every kind of discrimination, no matter how shiny its packaging!

  

Universal Humanity and the Chinese Question

  

Hs-y, there is a lot we can discuss in relation to this question. What is the situation of the Chinese in Indonesia at the moment? What is the uproar known as the PP 10 issue? What motivated the introduction of this regulation? Is it just a lot of empty noise? A fight over textile commissions? A struggle for influence? A way to improve the national economy? Or just some political move to advance the career of some individual? And if the latter is the case, what real basis is there for such a person to carry out such moves? Can it all be justified by science and humanity, historical and sociological development? We must be ready to face all these issues with courage, supported by our conscience. We must not hide behind any prejudices. We must face these new issues as our own problems, as part of our own life. And if it turns out that there is no justification for any of these developments? Then we must have the courage to reject them no matter what the consequences.

  

If we do not have the courage to face these issues in our own lives, then I am afraid, Hs-y, that we will end up eternally running and fall into the trap of limited humanity, where all are pitted against all.

  

Of course, Indonesia has, in fact, made speedy progress in humanitarian affairs. By ‘Indonesia’, I mean the Indonesian people. It is, of course, natural that the Indonesian people should be able to make such progress. Throughout their history they have always been a welcoming people, respecting all foreign peoples as long as there were no unpopular elements manipulating the good intentions of the people. With these advances, you would expect that the officials and big shots of the country – I hesitate to use the term ‘leaders’ – would reflect the attitude to be found in the hearts of the people, an attitude that has abandoned limited humanity and developed to the level of universal humanism.

  

I think that the inclusion of humanity as a principle in the Pancasila was not the result of some pencak-silat⁴ manoeuvre but the result of long and deep thinking. I truly believe that this principle, upon which the state has been founded, will never be betrayed. There will be no messing around with its format so that it turns into limited humanity, like the sick nationalistic socialism of the Nazis in Germany.

  

I need to convince you of this because an unhealthy nationalism, any such nationalism, is based on incomplete thinking, on hypocrisy. Such nationalism will be like a swamp that kills off the spiritual development of any citizen who lives there, no matter what other wealth might be found there. People should not be afraid when it comes to ensuring that humanity has the place it deserves. Such a fear would cause the destruction of everything, including our most secret, glorious hopes. An understanding of humanity cannot be crushed by a stoomwals⁵ of any dimension.

  

And as regards incomplete thinking and hypocrisy, I want to quote again from my paper at the Peace Conference. Forgive me if I am boring you by quoting from my own writings. Well, what can I say? That paper is very important to me in the current social, economic and political situation, national and international. So please forgive me. I argued that hypocrisy is an enemy of the development of culture and thus, of civilisation.

  

Hypocrisy originates from not taking a thought through to its conclusion. The origin of the word comes from hypo, meaning ‘half’, and kritik, meaning ‘thought’.

  

Hypocrisy can stem from an inability to take a thought through to its conclusion, or this can happen because that effort is blocked by some hidden obstacle!

  

This hypocrisy can arise in or give rise to different forms:

  

A contradiction between what is said and what is done... In this category we can also find deceits carried out in the international arena. Some countries formally adopt the principle of peaceful coexistence, but only at the level of international relations. So it becomes a kind of propaganda stunt at the national level, while domestically, oppression and the dispossession of livelihood still occur... For example, in many Asian countries today, the Chinese are being harassed and blamed for damaging the local economies. Nobody wants to discuss these developments from a historical or sociological point of view. And there is an extra complication resulting from these anti-Chinese emotions being mixed up with anticommunist sentiments. In the end, there is no way to get out of this complication... Any thoughts that are not taken to their conclusion will result in actions that reflect that lack of resolution. There will be chaos, and the younger generations will be misled in a way that prevents them from being able to give humanity the highest position of respect.

  

The Chinese question in Indonesia is the legacy of a very long history, longer than the Christian era itself. It is stupid to think this issue can somehow be resolved by using the sentiments of the bourgeoisie to gain advantages by expelling the Chinese from their lives and livelihoods. As children of the twentieth century, bound by the principles of science and learning, we must resolve the Chinese question through serious negotiations without abandoning the principles of humanity.

  

PP 10 is now being implemented. The press, which does not really know what it wants, is already beating the gong and trumpeting all the crimes that have ever been carried out by the Chinese, without ever looking at the good things, the positive and constructive things, the useful things [that the Chinese have done] for Indonesia. PP 10 is being implemented. But as a nation with a strong sense of dignity, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has offered unlimited assistance, if it is so desired by Indonesia. The PRC, along with the Soviet Union, has offered such assistance. And what is the press saying about this? Just speculation that the offer is motivated to get people to forget the behaviour of the Chinese. But the people will not forget. The elimination of illiteracy has proceeded very quickly in Indonesia.

  

Hs-y, a year ago I wrote to you that we would sweep away any trouble-making Chinese in Indonesia. You must not misunderstand. What I was referring to were individuals, trouble-making elements, and not to a whole racial group comprising a foreign minority that, in fact, represents a relatively large number of people.

  

It is also true that I have praised regulations in India and Burma that prevent foreigners from seeking a livelihood in those countries. I think everybody would agree with this while humankind’s thinking remains confined by abstract nationalism and perhaps even by a diseased nationalism. Now, international relations have developed with such closeness, as is reflected in the offers of assistance made by the PRC and the Soviet Union. And specifically in Indonesia now, we face a large number of foreign people who cannot be returned to their countries so easily. More importantly, the Chinese in Indonesia have remained aliens because of a lack of teaching and information from those who should have been providing this, whether officially or unofficially. They are not voyagers from abroad landed on our shores. They have been here as long as our own ancestors. They are, in fact, Indonesians, who live and die in Indonesia, also, but because of a certain political veiling, suddenly become strangers who are not foreign. They become a group unto themselves, occupying a middle position in society, at least a majority of them. This is a historical and sociological development, and not the result of the conscious will of the Chinese. They have filled a vacuum that has occurred in the system, in the social structure.

  

Let us discuss this question of the Chinese in accordance with reality. I will try to ensure that the discussion does not fall into the trap of limited humanity, with all its resulting shallowness. Nor should it take some easy but irresponsible path.

  

To return to limited humanity is to return to the Stone Age, even though such stones might be precious ones!

## Letter Two

  

## About Digging up Crimes that are not There

  

Hs-y,

  

In this letter I want to relate to you all the crimes that have been dug up and attributed to the Chinese. Of course I do not mean to try to say that the Chinese are a section of humanity that is free of sins. I think that life itself is a challenge for every person as to how to act. And every act, every deed, is always open to being a mistake. I myself cannot accept it when people attribute the mistake made by an individual from a specific race or group to the group as a whole. This is not right and never has been. If a Chinese breaks the law, criminal or civil, then take him to court and put him on trial in the proper manner. If it is proven he is a traitor, then punish him as a traitor. And if it is proven he has sown chaos in the economy, then treat him as an economic criminal, as a thief.

  

Usually anti-Chinese feelings in Indonesia occur as a result of racialism. Because somebody is Chinese and not Indonesian, so he or she is hated. And, of course, it has not been the people who have harboured such sentiments. In the midst of their hard work, the people have had no need to develop feelings of antipathy towards other peoples so long as there have not been other destructive elements manipulating the honesty of the people. Very well then, let me analyse racialism as the first category of attack on the Chinese, of efforts to inflame antipathy.

  

Racialism

  

Racialism is an outlook that rejects people from another race. This is its broad meaning. Racialism emerges or can emerge when there is a section of people who have a different physiology from what generally exists in a society. The minority that exhibits this difference must also be unable to defend itself. Forgive me if I quote again from my paper from Bandung:

  

... there is a new fashion in Southeast Asia with the slogan: Because you have slant eyes, I have rights over you! This house is my house, you have no rights to it at all! Of course, those suffering the oppression will protest, as it is the right of every person to defend himself: But master, you with power, I have obtained this through hard work and after much difficulty. And the representative of the stronger section of society will decide: I am the strong one here, I am the big fish, you are just the sardine. So it is my right to swallow you. Come on my sweet, let me swallow you! It is your fault for having slant eyes!

  

If the minority is strong, then society will lose its racial lusts. Racialism always reflects cowardice in society.

  

There are many aspects to racialism. For example, Hs-y, here in Indonesia there are many myths about the role of blood in human evolution. Foreign people are thought to have completely different blood than local people. Of course, this has no scientific basis. But this myth continues to be used as a weapon, keeping alive the animal spirit of hatred and rejection of peoples who are not liked. Blood, an ordinary aspect of life and something that can be studied under a microscope, is considered to contain amazing secret powers. Of course this is not true. Such beliefs are possible because society has not yet properly developed a modern character; it has not yet recognised science as one of its key elements.

  

So, Hs-y, the [North American Plains] Indians used to believe that the human soul is located in the feet. This originated from their experiences: if a person or a horse had an injured foot, it would mean that person would end up dead, unable to flee from the dangers of the prairie. Many ethnic groups in Indonesia still believe that the human soul resides in blood. Does this mean that if a person loses two litres of his blood, he also loses two litres of his soul?

  

The Javanese also used to believe that in order to determine whether A was the child of B, who had died, some blood should be taken from A and smeared on the bones of B. If the bones absorbed the blood of A, then it confirmed paternity. I have yet to hear of any scientific investigation confirming this. Perhaps one day a university laboratory somewhere will investigate it. Perhaps. Perhaps not.

  

And so, Hs-y, blood keeps its secrets even until today. Or perhaps some people maintain these beliefs, which they themselves do not actually believe in, in order to gain some benefit from them.

  

For many primitive societies, blood is used in various terrible ceremonies. But these secrets of the blood have been rejected totally by scientific development since around the seventeenth century, when blood transfusions with animals started to take place. This happened in England and France. Finally, the so-called secrets were ended by the Czech researcher Janský, who discovered the four different blood types among humans in 1907. He began to carry out blood transfusions between humans.

  

An Indonesian racialist, who a priori rejects the Chinese as an enemy at home, sometimes may fall back upon differentiating people on the basis of whether they are pure or non-pure Indonesians. With the secret of blood exposed as false, they fall back on other physical traits. Because Chinese are not pure Indonesian, they must be rejected as devils and fiends. But can the difference between pure and non-pure Indonesian really be used as a measure? This kind of thinking leads people astray and narrows the world. Are there any people whose blood is free from the presence of the blood of other people? No. According to anthropologists, the inhabitants of Indonesia, those called ‘original Indonesians’, are, in fact, themselves from outside. The ancestors of the inhabitants today moved down from Asia, through Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Annam, Vietnam, Burma, the Philippines and Indonesia. These peoples came in two waves. The first was that of the Paleo-Mongoloids, and the second, the Neo-Mongoloids. They were part of the Mongol race. They were from the same race as the Chinese. So originally, Indonesians and Chinese were from the same race, the Mongols. This conclusion was also confirmed by the research of Sudjojono in his book published during the revolution. In that book he provided evidence that both Indonesian and Chinese children can have a blue birthmark, the mongoolse vlek [Mongol mark], on their buttocks. So is there any basis for claims of purity of racial origins that can differentiate between Chinese and Indonesians? Anthropologists have clearly explained now that the two peoples come from the Mongol race. Oh, I understand that the racialists will say that there are differences between Chinese and Indonesians. They will say that Chinese have slant eyes and fairer skin.

  

In his book Handbook of Sociology, William F. Ogburn explained that such physical differences may occur when a group of humans splits off from the original group and moves to live in another region. The environment in their new home will result in the development of new physical and spiritual characteristics. Such physical differences among people originating from the same race occur because of the influence of the natural environment. So, once again, the whole idea of differentiating races on the basis of pure and non-pure collapses.

  

Taking into account the investigations of the anthropologists, I challenge all racialists in Indonesia: Can they show that they themselves are 100% racially pure? Can they show that they have 100% pure blood, untainted by blood from any other peoples? I think there is not a single Indonesian or Chinese who can prove that they are of such pure blood. Is there not one drop or cell of blood of another people flowing in their bodies? It is very clear that, both at an individual level and at an ethnic group level, Indonesians exhibit biological features similar to those of the Chinese. They are all of the same line of descent! This cannot be denied. So, are such people considered not to be pure Indonesians? Must those who have been here for centuries, developing real traditions, be classified as foreigners or as new Indonesian citizens?

  

Actually, talking about new Indonesian citizens reminds me of a speech by Buyung Saleh¹ at the 1959 Lekra Congress. He said that every Indonesian citizen, whether of foreign or indigenous descent, is a new citizen. Everyone became a new citizen on 17 August 1945. Buyung Saleh has a way of speaking that makes you feel like he is just chatting. But what he said was quite serious, no matter from what angle we look at it. With this new citizenship that began on 17 August 1945, it is not at all appropriate to seek out differences based on what is pure and non-pure or indigenous and non-indigenous. This perspective is also relevant to the question of Indonesian and Chinese citizenship (that is, the issue of citizenship of the People’s Republic of China for overseas Chinese). As I said in my first letter, the Chinese here have become aliens because of a political partition. Just look at the Sunarjo-Chou Agreement and Law No. 3/1946 about Citizenship and Residence of the Republic of Indonesia.² It is not at all definite that Chinese choose citizenship of the PRC out of a high degree of consciousness on the question. There are many issues about which they do not understand, and many of them just follow the guidance given by those they consider to have some political understanding. So some reject Indonesian citizenship or actively opt for PRC citizenship. The Chinese in Indonesia do not have a strong political tradition because the Dutch suppressed any process of emancipation. So it is very hard to assert that the Chinese have rejected Indonesian citizenship and opted for PRC citizenship out of some kind of political consciousness! And even if such a choice did reflect a conscious political choice, is this a crime?

  

I will not try to answer this in this letter as it is outside its scope.

  

Hs-y, I cannot accept any anti-Chinese sentiment based upon racialism. There are no secrets of the blood. And if political arguments are attempted, I cannot accept them either, as I have argued above. Yet, the racialists look for still other justifications, in the end still racialist, to justify and spread their anti-Chinese sentiments.

  

Racialism has never been a strong argument for suppression. Why? Hs-y, what in fact is ‘race’? Is not ‘race’ just a word, a word produced by the scientific endeavour to categorise the inhabitants of the world using hypothetical and abstract categories according to the specific features of a people? Is not ‘race’ just a term invented by scholars rather than some kind of natural category? It was Freiherr von Eickstedt³ who grouped human beings according to such features as colour and texture of hair, skin colour, physical measurements, and sometimes using the index cephalicus (weight of the brain). Did he ever guess that his work would be used later by some people to further their own vested interests or those of some group? Von Eickstedt never predicted that his work would become the basis of a theory to divide humankind against itself. And the motive for some people to do this is always self-interest. This has always been the case throughout human history.

  

So where does this thing, race, come from? Not from nature! It came from the desire of the Western peoples to understand better the non-European peoples, their customs and civilisations. This scientific work was led by Rousseau, Johann Forster, and Voltaire. That was how the science of race or peoples (ethnology) began. Based on this knowledge of the Indian and Chinese peoples, the West was able to carry out an even more intensive form of colonisation. The same fate befell Indonesia and the other countries of Asia and Africa. This occurred in an era when such superiority in science and learning, in intellectual activities, was used to seek victims elsewhere. Today, among the progressive peoples of the world, we do not want to turn any people into victims. We need and want friendship and understanding between peoples. But even now in this liberal era, learning and scholarship, themselves free of any racist blemish, are still being used to segregate people by imperialism and colonialism. Both the peoples of China and Indonesia are waging a struggle against these hated phenomena.

  

Very well then, now these racialists sometimes do not use the race argument. Perhaps this is progress. Now they bring forward another accusation: The Chinese are a threat to the Indonesian economy! The interests of eighty-five million Indonesians (this figure is actually a product of magic as there has been no census yet) will not be sacrificed for the interests of a small foreign minority! This is the kind of argument used by people looking for a stick to beat a dog. Why? The Indonesian people are burdened with a level of tax perhaps greater than that of any other people, perhaps more even than those people who are still colonised. The tax burden of the people under the Republic of Indonesia is much heavier now than during the period of the Dutch East Indies. The Chinese, who were here even before the Dutch, cannot therefore be blamed for this.

  

But why is it only now that people are agitating about the Chinese in Indonesia? And if it were true that the Chinese were the root cause of difficulties of the Indonesian economy, why is no one asking why? And if it were true, is this not because the social system provides such a space for the Chinese, for anybody, to do damage to the economy? Why is it not the system, specifically the economic system, which is being attacked, but rather just a foreign minority who is? Why is a system not developed where neither Chinese nor Indonesians can take advantage over others no matter what position they have in the structure, whether they have no position or whether they are right at the top? That way the whole Indonesian people could benefit. This is indeed a difficult task. And it is not just an intellectually creative task but one that needs hard work as well. I think that the current big shots and officials, who only know how to order people around, are not capable of doing this. If they did try to carry out such a task, it would mean facing the people directly and working for and with the people, and not the other way around. And do these officials and big shots have sufficient knowledge and familiarity with the people? Well, let the racialists answer this question themselves because, in fact, they will not be able to give any answer.

  

So what is the secret of the origins of all this controversy around the Chinese? And what is the real purpose of Operation Prosperity⁴ [and PP 10]? These questions must be answered, especially as this whole hubbub has nothing to do with any government program to solve the problem of the people’s need for food and clothing. The freezing of Chinese capital will not mean that one more pair of underpants will be available to the people or that their capacity to buy will increase. The freezing of this capital will only mean that the poor will become poorer. Even the most insensitive economist will admit that the Indonesian economy must be a guided economy and based upon cooperatives, but is this synonymous with expelling the Chinese from their arena of livelihood? Is it a responsible action to throw the livelihood and homes of an entire group into chaos and force them to move to some new area just like that? There are those who say that the Chinese must be forced out of the villages so that they can be replaced by Indonesian traders. Such an argument only exposes the stupidity of those promoting it.

  

First, you do not become a merchant in just one or two days. You need knowledge of all the goods traded in your region. The individual traits – the preparedness to work hard, to provide whatever service is needed no matter how small – do not just fall from the sky like a meteor. These all require time. If such a change were implemented, commerce in the villages would come to a standstill. And if they think, as is often the case, that the Indonesian people can be treated as guinea pigs, then it is they who are the aliens, that is, they are alien from the Indonesian people. There are those who try to hide the emptiness in their heads with the argument: We are only banning them from trading in the villages. They have to be gathered together in the residency towns so they can trade there. But everybody knows that, in the kind of liberal economy that we have now, trade is determined by supply and demand. It is impossible that in some residency there is already trade amounting to X and then all of a sudden it must sustain 3 or 4 times X. Yes, of course, you can use force as long as you wield power in your right hand and wield a stick in your right hand. But are we not humans and not cattle? Is it perhaps a crime that we are human?

  

In any case, the argument of the racialists that the Chinese are the enemy of the national economy and their role must be ended is full of contradictions. If I think about this, their argument seems even more incomprehensible. The thing is that the Indonesian economy is still a liberal economy. Commerce is still carried out in the private sector. A merchant is still a merchant, no matter whether he is Indonesian, Chinese or Arab. Does it make sense to argue that Indonesians should seize these positions just to become themselves enemies of the national economy? Does it mean that if an Indonesian takes over this role that his crimes will be less or that he should be forgiven or that we should turn a blind eye to them? Of course not! To defend such an approach is to join the ranks of the racialists and fascists!

  

So what lies behind this whole hubbub about the Chinese? Be patient. We will discuss this in the letter about demography and economy.

  

The Indonesian People Are an Immigrant People, Not an Indigenous People

  

Hs-y, the racialists, of course, maintain their line that Chinese are not Indonesians either racially or politically. Well, we can kind of understand this because, of course, the Chinese come from outside Indonesia. From China, they say. Very true. But can they defend scientifically the claim that they themselves are indigenous? Do they dare say that as human beings, they are really different from the Chinese and from other humans? There is even a religious belief that all humans come from Adam, or even further, that all human beings, be they round-eyed or slant-eyed, come from God. Do the racialists not believe in religion? I think they have gone mad perhaps, if they have decided to go against their religion.

  

Hs-y, perhaps they want to go so far as to say that the Chinese are not descendants of Adam and it is only the racialists that are descended from Adam. Can they answer the question: Was Adam then an Indonesian? Or did Adam live in Indonesia? I think there is no scholar who can prove this! And if they do not believe the anthropological research that they are descendants of people who migrated here, why do they not claim that they are the descendants of the prehistoric humans who lived here? In fact, who were these prehistoric humans who lived here? Are they just like the stones collected in the museums? Von Koenigswald discovered the remains of Megantropus Palaeojavanicus and proved that he was a human with a protruding jaw who lived 600,000 years ago in Sangit. Then E. Dubois discovered the 400,000 year old remains of a human ape in the Bengawan Solo area. That human was still an ape! Or will the racialists claim to be the descendants of Homo Soloensis or Homo Wajakensis, who lived in a later period? The historians say that these humans disappeared completely from the face of the earth! They say that there is no relationship between them and the inhabitants of Indonesia today. So, do the racialists claim they are the descendants of some surviving Pithecanthropus Erectus? Oh, I think they are truly bizarre and sick!

  

Hs-y, we will not accept the arguments of the racialists, whether they claim to be descendants of Pithecanthropus Erectus or of the Indonesian Adam, with or without his citizenship certificate. So they will have to accept the fact that they are an immigrant people and descended from the same origins as the Chinese, those slant-eyed ones.

  

As I explained above, the ancestors of Indonesians originated in Asia. From the same place as the Chinese or the Burmese or Thais. Based on the biological similarities, this cannot be denied. It is the same in the arena of culture, where there are also similarities. In a recent article in the Nhan Dan newspaper in Hanoi, the Indonesian Ambassador to Vietnam, Sunarjo, commented on shared antecedents that Indonesians have with the peoples of Burma, Vietnam and Thailand:

  

... according to the analysis of historians and ethnologists, the Indonesian and Vietnamese people have the same origins. In Vietnam, as well as in Indonesia, there have been found similar items from the Stone Age: stone axes, tools made from bones, cooking pots, and other items made from stones. There are also many similarities in the customs and traditions of the two peoples. This proves that there have been centuries of historical contact (Antara, 25 June 1959).

  

The real indigenous inhabitants of Indonesia were pushed aside by the new waves of immigrants. They either were physically wiped out, or they lost any original cultural characteristics and were absorbed into the new population. The Chinese, who arrived later, entered a society that was already historically and ethnologically stable and formed. These Chinese became an integrated part of society. This situation lasted for centuries before the arrival of the Western invaders. There is no historical evidence of any crimes or disturbances caused by the Chinese.

  

If we follow social developments through from a primitive society to that of a national society, then we arrive at the stage of national development we have now reached. But it is not enough to look at this from a political perspective alone. We must take note of the progressive thinking, the increasingly progressive thinking, which the new society has produced.

  

The movement of the Chinese southwards to Indonesia was motivated by the same factor that motivated the earlier migrations from Burma and Thailand: the desire for a better life. If you like, you can also view these two migrations, the earlier and the later ones, as the migration of expelled peoples. They left their countries, where they had resided for so long, because they were not prepared to become the victims of the social systems that prevailed in their countries.

  

And for how long have the Chinese been coming to Indonesia? Since before the birth of Christ and since before the birth of Muhammad. Most clearly since before the birth of Indonesian nationalism.

  

Once civilisation provided the means to keep records, it became possible to see how for centuries the Chinese have come here in migration after migration. Some came to reside, others to trade. Up until the arrival of the Dutch East Indies Company [VOC, from the Dutch Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie], the presence of the Chinese caused no trouble. These continuous small migrations left their biological mark among many of the Indonesian peoples: Menadonese, Dayak, people from Palembang, and the inhabitants all along the Java coast, as well as those in Banjar, Pontianak, and other places.

  

It was only with the arrival of the VOC that the presence of the Chinese became an issue or was made into an issue. The colonisers wanted to make use of the strengths of the Chinese to consolidate their own position on Indonesian soil. In a deliberate and systematic way, the Dutch brought new labourers from China, either by buying slaves in Hong Kong, Canton or Macau (people whom they called ‘pig’s children’), or by shanghaiing and kidnapping them, as told in the diary of Bontekoe (Kisah Pelayaran Nahkoda Bontekoe, translated into Malay by A.F. von Dewall). The kidnapping was necessary because the Chinese refused to sign a trade agreement with the Dutch. There were also those Chinese who fled the social system that provided no place for them. Others were forced to flee as a result of clan wars, as is described by Kao Yun-lan in Annals of a Provincial Town. We know that the Chinese did not come here for a picnic or on some happy excursion; they came to work hard. From that point of view, the suffering they experienced was not so different from that which was experienced by Indonesians themselves. But it cannot be denied that history provides no evidence that the Chinese came here with any economic or political agenda. It has never been proven that the fact that the majority of the immigrants were traders was part of some attempt to achieve the economic colonisation of the local peoples. Rather, this social reality was the result of a long process.

  

Not before, during, or after the Dutch arrival has there ever been any evidence of the Chinese engaging in political activities aimed at conquering Indonesia. The only example of a Chinese attack on Indonesia was the expedition sent by Kublai Khan. But Kublai Khan was not an emperor of China in the way that many people imagine. He was a Mongol king who had conquered and occupied China. The fact that the Chinese have never been an enemy of the Indonesian people has been outlined by many writers, both from the West and East. Excerpts from the magazine Sin Tjun in 1956 paint a rather clear picture:

  

In There is No Asia (1954), Dwight Cooke wrote: 20 million Chinese outside of China represents a huge mass of people ready to be anybody’s friends, no less significant than any other people of Asia.

  

In Hoakiau, F. Veldhuysen wrote: if people ask what do the Chinese live from in Indonesia, they will answer: from anything or everything!

  

And he [Veldhuysen] quoted the famous saying from Helffeirch (a German economist): If there were no Chinese, people would have to create them.

  

Prof. Ch. Robequain, from the University of Paris, held the view that the Chinese contribution to manners in the Malay world has been underestimated, that they have played an important role in the economy, and that without them the region would be without its yeast.

  

The fact that the Chinese issue has been under consideration by people for such a long time should make us all think. But the thing is not just to rave on not knowing what we really want. Neither is it right to launch some movement against the Chinese, especially given that they are in such a weak position, being a minority, without the political strength to resist, and open to every attack. So, Hs-y, there are no Indonesians able to prove that they are the original Indonesians. Especially the Chinese. So then the new accusations started.

  

The Chinese and PP 10/1959

  

The racialists, with all their old arguments exhausted, renewed their attacks from a political standpoint. Haven’t all these Chinese decided to take PRC citizenship and not Indonesian? Is that not a reason to see them as aliens and justification for our action to run them out of the areas where they earn their livelihood?

  

At this point we return to the original question: Are we human beings or beasts? How would these racialists feel if, because of some twist of fate, they themselves had been Chinese? I cannot accept their policy. As part of a nation that has raised the level of its humanity by defeating colonialism, I feel I have the right to demand that we maintain this level of humanity we have achieved because of the revolution. We do not want to fall back into ways that we have left behind and have fought against. As an illustration, I would like to tell you a little about the example of Cuba, which has just won its independence and is firmly defending the dignity it won through its revolution, including that of the Chinese who live there.

  

There are around thirty thousand Chinese in Cuba. Major Guevara,⁵ the chairperson of the Cuban delegation that visited Indonesia, explained that the Chinese in Cuba had become part of the Cuban people and had been absorbed among the seven million Cubans.

  

He acknowledged there were those who remained as foreigners, as well as those who supported the old regime. But that was the result of the individual decisions of those people and was not representative of the Chinese as a whole.

  

Guevara went on to explain:

  

The Cuban government does not implement discrimination against them as a group. We have no different policies towards them as people of Chinese descent, and we consider them as Cubans. Even though they still go by Chinese names, they struggle as Cubans. (Republik, 4 August 1959)

  

So Cuba is Cuba. What about Indonesia? In the Indonesian Medium-Sized Merchants Union Working Conference, the former Minister Rachmat Muljomiseno explained that within the framework of guided democracy there was a place for private enterprise, but:

  

... I have issued an instruction to end all activities by aliens at the District and Village levels by the end of 1959. (Antara, 15 May 1959)

  

Nobody would object, including the Chinese, if Rachmat Muljomiseno⁶ had implemented his policy as a true leader and not just as some thoughtless bureaucratic issuer of instructions. Anybody can issue instructions! And in this case, we are dealing with the lives of people, a lot of people indeed. And what happened then? The instructions were implemented with no preparations, without any ability to show that the policy would be implemented in a way that respected the dignity of people or that it was in accord with intellectual and leadership values.

  

In the midst of all kinds of activity by the nascent Indonesian bourgeoisie, as they demanded special laws to legalise the status of national enterprises, there came the warning by the Grobogan provincial parliament against racially discriminative policies. At the same time that Ismail Hasan, a representative of the Islamic youth, reminded people of the importance of good relations between the people of Indonesia and the PRC and an arts delegation prepared to visit the PRC, a truncheon hovered over the heads of all Chinese in Indonesia ready to crack down on them at any moment. Just because for some reason or other they were considered as aliens.

  

Muljomiseno said that the role of the small-scale retailer would be taken over by cooperatives. The Indonesian Cooperatives Council would have a target of replacing 15% of the activity of alien capital in the villages. But how would the total trading of these retail merchants be replaced? According to government figures, it amounts now to three billion rupiah⁷ (Antara, 27 July 1959). So is it necessary that not only the small foreign traders suffer this calamity, but a similar fate also befall the Indonesian people, who now face a sudden vacuum in petty trade because of this government decision?

  

The Chinese themselves, of course, have the right to state their opinion on this, even though the racialists will surely try to corrupt that right. Do those about to be executed not have the right to some last words? So a statement was issued by the Bandung CHTH [Chinese Association], pleading, in the name of humanity, the spirit of Bandung and Indonesian-PRC friendship, that the government reconsider its decision.

  

Ang Tjay Tek, Chairperson of the Bandung CHTH, explained:

  

... the majority of small merchants of foreign nationality in the villages are PRC citizens who have lived in Indonesia for generations; who live simply, at a level hardly distinguishable from how the Indonesian people live; and they represent the main channel for distribution of basic goods, especially for the village people.

  

The CHTH chairperson guaranteed that the Chinese would obey all government regulations and help in the development of the national economy. But, he said, tens of thousands of families would suffer as a result of the regulation issued by the Minister of Trade. It was not easy to shift to larger towns at the provincial and residency level. Some towns had closed-door policies; others had rules banning foreigners from taking work. Many towns would be turned into centres of large-scale unemployment. Furthermore, the ministerial regulation had been issued too quickly, and nobody had time to collect their thoughts (Antara, August 1959).

  

How many individuals, enterprises and families must suffer this catastrophe because of the instructions issued by His Excellency Rachmat Muljomiseno?

  

In West Java there are 9,095 retail outlets, of which 2,300 are outside large towns (Antara, idem). In the Malang residency there are 695 kiosks (with 4,500 families) that will be hit by the regulation. In Pasuruan there are 230 kiosks (1,400 families); in Probolinggo, 240 kiosks (with 1,500 families); and in Lumajang, 220 kiosks (with 1,300 families) (Republik, 7 August 1959). These are just some examples. If we look at the total picture, using official statistics, we get the following.

  

As at the end of July [1959], the official statistics show there are 114,875 foreign merchants in the whole country. There are 1,326 wholesalers, 26,859 medium-sized merchants, and 86,690 small peddler merchants. It should be noted that this data is not complete as a result of the security situation in Sulawesi and Sumatra. Of these 114,875 foreign traders, 109,466 are Chinese. The majority of these Chinese traders are peddler merchants, namely, 83,783. There are 24,991 medium-sized merchants, and 692 are big traders. They are spread out in the following regions:

  

East Java: 26,388; East Sumatra: 14,627; Jakarta Metropolitan Area: 13,927; West Sumatra: 891 (497 peddler merchants; 360 medium-sized merchants and 34 wholesalers) (PIA, 24 August 1959)

  

If we assume that each trader supports four people [making up a family of five], then the total number of Chinese affected by this regulation is 5 x 109,466 = 547,330 people, so more than half a million! I have included the wholesaler and medium-sized merchant Chinese in this calculation because the sense of solidarity among the whole community will mean that this will have an impact on all Chinese.

  

So, at least half a million will feel the cane come down on their heads! Who is responsible for this? The racialists? They, in fact, need to see real victims. Half a million people! Half a million! Listen, Hs-y: Half a million! Does that figure not say something? Have the humanitarian instincts of the racialists been completely ruined? Half a million people whose lives will be thrown into chaos! Half a million!

  

Do you know what I see in my mind’s eye, Hs-y? I see a town, and at the edge of this town are grandfathers and grandmothers, children, pregnant women, young men and women dreaming about their future, school children – and all of them no longer know what is going to happen to them. The source of water has dried up – life-giving water! It is as if they are just waiting for death to arrive, depending on the availability of water in the house, which tomorrow or the next day will surely dry up.

  

Perhaps shocked by the impact of the instructions from His Excellency Rachmat Muljomiseno, the Ministry of Trade issued a corrective regulation aimed at softening the impact of the original regulation. After Muljomiseno had lost his position as Minister, they issued an order to their inspectors in the regions on the issue of the expulsion of foreign kiosks and foreign (PRC) people who live outside provincial and residency capitals. They announced that the instructions were a correction to the instructions of Muljomiseno. The key points of the corrective instructions were:

  

1. The closure of a shop owned by a foreign national does not mean that the individual person must leave the village or place. Such a person has the right to provide his labour for activities in that area outside of trading activities, as long as there is no contradiction with regulations concerning the status of foreign nationals.

  

2. In order to promote the development of cooperatives, people involved in kiosks and shops owned by foreign nationals can be employed as staff in cooperatives, and their capital may be lent to cooperatives (but not to individuals).

  

3. The instructions shall not apply to enterprises trading in services (diensverlenende bedrijven), which can continue their activities.

  

These corrective instructions do appear to contain aspects that lighten the burden. But is this really the case? Developments would prove one way or the other. The reaction of the world press, from Rangoon, Cambodia, Singapore and Germany, assessed the instructions, with or without the correction, as an anti-Chinese policy. I think there is not much need to interpret again this assessment. Or perhaps it is enough just to read a few lines from a letter sent by the Federation of Chinese Associations in Surabaya to the Junior Minister for Trade requesting that the Muljomiseno regulation be reconsidered so that “the approximately 10,000 small Chinese traders in East Java will not fall into unemployment and destitution”.

  

Indonesia already suffers from so much unemployment, which grows at the end of every school year.

  

Perhaps the racialists will come out with another fanatical argument: Let them suffer; after all, they are only foreigners. If that is the case, then they are really at the same level as those tribes in the Lambaréné Valley, with their limited humanity, about which Schweitzer wrote. Perhaps they would still hold the line and say: So what? We admit we have a limited humanity; the Chinese, too, have never shown any sense of universal humanism. Very well then, let us close the discussion on humanity here and shift to the economic side of things.

  

Is it not the case that due to the instructions of Muljomiseno, three billion rupiah will change from being productive to purely consumptive capital? Will not this mean that the amount of money in circulation will increase dramatically but without an increase in the production of services? Will this not, in fact, create more damage to the economic life of the people? Three billion! You cannot even print that much in a week!

  

The crucial issue is that Indonesia is developing a guided economy as a replacement for a liberal [free market] economy. That we are shifting to a guided economy does not mean that we should be making enemies of the Chinese, who have become merchants and traders as a result of there being a free market economy. They did not create this free market economy and neither did we. It is merely a product of past human history. Our enemy is the free market economy, not the Chinese. And in a guided economy, the energy and capital of the Chinese can be of service. Their experience and capabilities can be useful for the development of a healthy national economy. It is their right to choose PRC citizenship. And if that means they are going to be viewed as foreign nationals, then we should treat them as foreign nationals and not like cattle that can be herded here and there into corrals. People with dignity show it in their actions; they do not get it by begging for it from other countries.

  

Foreigners? Very well then, look upon them as foreigners. But Indonesia must develop using every bit of strength and energy that can be found in its society. It certainly should not be destroying such strengths and energies. The racialists have no grounds to say this; all they want to do is to harass a minority that cannot defend itself.

  

All Peoples Can Commit Crimes

  

Here and there, the racialists still try to justify the animal lusts that dwell in them: The Chinese must be attacked; they survive by their economic crimes, from moneylending to counterfeiting! It is so easy to accuse. Such accusations might be proven if they were made against specific individuals, but not when they are levelled against a whole group. Some say: They have a group attitude that is unacceptable to us! Hs-y, let me tell you another story. Before the arrival of the VOC, the Chinese had been absorbed by Indonesian society. But as the colonialists began to understand that there was a continuing, spontaneous migration of Chinese to Indonesia (no need for kidnapping or slavery), the colonialists began to fear the growing number of Chinese. They felt threatened. So the VOC introduced all kinds of regulations to limit these migrations. But not only that, the regulations were used to bring in money for the colonialists as well. Money for the colonialists, disaster for the Chinese! There could be no other outcome. When it comes to money, it is rare for people to be able to separate themselves from cruelty. The greedier the person, the more cruel they are; these two traits almost always go together.

  

Since then, the Chinese have been treated like a rubbish bin into which every kind of filth has been thrown: insults, humiliations, degradation, agitation, torture, murder. They were never in a position to resist. They had no army! They were just peaceful people not after anything else but a bowl of rice. No matter how they were treated, they would accept it. Many of the Chinese were not able to comply with the Dutch regulations and so had their property and money confiscated. They were thrown into jail and later sent to Ceylon or South Africa. The strange thing was that none of them were ever sent back to China. So the motive was clearly to torment them.

  

These new regulations slowed down the process of integrating the new Chinese arrivals into Indonesian society. These included the pass regulations of 1848 that applied until 1920⁸. The situation was made worse when the Dutch brought to Indonesia a European practice forced upon the Jews: all the Chinese were forced to live in the same place, called Pecinan [Chinese quarter]. The Chinese became a segregated group in society. It was this policy that forced most Chinese to become traders. Previously, as with the rest of the Indonesian people, they had sought a livelihood as farmers, labourers and craftsmen, working alongside local people.

  

At the same time, the colonial-imperialistic mentality that was dominant among the colonisers also affected the Chinese: How to maximise profit, no matter what that meant for the customer. The only constraint on their lusts was that which stemmed from free competition. The policies of the Dutch colonialists towards the Chinese caused them to adopt asocial behaviour, that is, they caused the Chinese to show the absence or a weak sense of responsibility to society as a whole.

  

This situation meant that they were even more open to accusations from the colonisers. It was as if everybody who lived during the Dutch period had the right to judge as well as punish the Chinese. This tactic enabled the Dutch to direct the attention of the people away from themselves as colonisers. The fact that they were not wiped out altogether is an epic story of its own.

  

The main accusation levelled against them was that they were moneylenders, that they lived off interest, and that they sold goods on instalment with interest. But the commercial policy of the Dutch banned them from any other activities where money was not involved. They could not become farmers or civil servants.

  

Do they deserve these accusations?

  

Hs-y, I do not think so. In the liberal-imperialist system, which is also still joined to the pre-existing feudal system, everybody has the right to gobble up everybody else as long as there is no law banning some specific activity. In any case, things such as moneylending and usury have been around a long time and certainly are not synonymous with the Chinese. There are quite a few old inscriptions left to us in Indonesian history that talk about debts and which involve elements of usury (see Dr. J.G. de Casparis, Selected Inscriptions from the 7th to the 9th Century AD). There are also records of bodemerij, regulations about moneylending among the seagoing traders of the Islamic era, which are the reverse of the kind of insurance we have today.

  

Hs-y, their forced isolation from the broader society naturally created a sense of shared fate among them, created a new mentality, a group mentality, the mentality of a minority, which originated from their being put in a position of alienation which forced them to confront society as something external and alien.

  

The Chinese in Indonesia are victims of history. That is all. But we should not look at them only from a negative standpoint. They have also contributed a lot to the progress of Indonesian society, and this I will show in further letters.

  

Perhaps someone will say: But this is a question of foreigners. Hs-y, as I have already said, the Chinese have been turned into foreigners by new developments, political and judicial, which have not really been properly understood, either by scholars or politicians. This is the question of the rise of nationalism and its impact on minorities. This is why Operation Prosperity appears as a kind of immature, or improperly digested and poorly understood, extension of the [nationalist] spirit. I want eventually to get to this issue also, assuming no roadblock appears along this rather narrow path.

  

But even today in this modern era, we hear statements from high officials, such as those by the lawyer Mr. Alwi from the Immigration Department, who announced that PRC citizens banned from trade will be relocated to ghettos! Does he know what a ghetto is and yet still uses the term? Then he should throw away his law degree! Yes, Hs-y, a law degree is not real proof of being a scholar; it is just a sign, nothing more, that he has graduated from some school somewhere.

## Letter Three

  

## The Expulsion of the Chinese and Its Reality

  

Hs-y,

  

On this night which is enveloped by the atmosphere of Christmas and the coming of the New Year, my heart feels truly moved to be able to speak with my own soul – a soul that for some time recently has been upset by the agitation about the Hoakiau problem. There is not a force on this earth that can stop a person from speaking with his own soul. As it happens, I am a writer, and so I will try to write down my feelings, my thoughts, my knowledge about this Hoakiau problem. Possibly other people will ask, why does this problem attract and disturb my soul so much. That I shall not deny! First of all, because my feeling of humanism is offended, second because I prefer being friends with the peoples of all countries, and third because I could not deny if it were said that it is possible I also have Chinese blood flowing in me. And Hs-y, there is nothing more precious in this life than friendship, because it gives our life so much greater space. It is only enmity that narrows life.

  

To be honest, I admire the toughness, the industriousness, the honesty and the revolutionary character of the people of China. The people of Indonesia, outside of its bourgeoisie, can learn much from the people of China about how to develop the country. There has never been such a rapid and giant development of a country as that experienced by the PRC, which has changed the face of the earth and humankind through its revolution! That is the PRC!

  

There is much that can be learned from the PRC. Yet there are still those in Indonesia who only wish to view the PRC as something evil, usually based on their own fantasies. They try to influence public opinion with their fantasy that everything from the PRC is evil. This is clearly the thinking of people who have lost the plot. Good things can be found everywhere, and this is also true of evil. And if we would like to be viewed as somewhat pious, we could take up the words of the well-known Protestant, Pascal¹, who wrote in his memoirs:

  

It is dangerous if human beings are always being told that they are like animals and are not shown their nobility. It is also dangerous if human beings are only ever shown their nobility and never the depths of degradation they can reach. And it is worse still if they are left in ignorance about both these things.

  

I do not mean to moralise but it truly pains me to see the actions of this group of people who wish to see only the weaknesses of the PRC, and they are probably just talking nonsense anyway. Then they bang their drums, rattle their cans, shout and cry out, and do all kinds of acrobatics in order to cover up their own crimes by shouting out the crimes of others, which are probably just their own fantasies anyway. Now they shout: Enemies of the economy! And the latest thing we hear them roar is something currently the fashion in the free world: Fifth column!

  

Let me give an explanation of what lies behind all this din.

  

The Big Myth About the Fifth Column

  

The big myth that the Chinese in Indonesia constitute a fifth column, as I have mentioned in earlier letters, comes from the worry of the colonisers that the Indonesian people would be more sympathetic to the Chinese than to themselves. They needed to position the Chinese in such a way that they would be seen in their worst light. Before the arrival of the VOC, there had never been any tensions in relations between the local people and the Chinese. In the earlier period, people did not use the term ‘fifth column’ because that arose only at the beginning of World War II.

  

At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Chinese were referred to as ‘the undesirables’ (D.G.E. Hall, A History of Southeast Asia). This term often changed. Sometimes there was no need for any term; the sentiment was manifested in deeds: beatings, humiliation, oppression, murder. And the final term, the one most used, the one providing the greatest challenge in the modern world is ‘fifth column’.

  

The hostile sentiment towards ‘the undesirables’ first arose in Java, or more specifically, in Batavia. It arose among the colonial officials, of course, and not among the people. [Dutch Governor General] J.P. Coen brought them here, forcibly of course, sending an armada to kidnap Chinese living along the coast. They were brought to Batavia because of their skills as craftsmen, because of their industriousness and enterprise. Hs-y, this need to be emphasised: They were not brought to Batavia to become merchants! There were Chinese already in Batavia before those brought out by Coen, but they were farmers, growing pepper, sugar, trading in tea, and, most common of all, working as craftsmen.

  

As the colonialists began to realise that the traditional, long-term migration was continuing, they grew afraid of the growing number of Chinese. Under the pretext of defending public order, they began to persecute the Chinese. This included violence against those looking for work, many of whom would die before they found any work. But there was one thing that must be noted about many of these Chinese, in particular those kidnapped and brought to Indonesia. They were coastal people, far from the centres of feudalism. They were people who were free and independent, or half-free and independent. They were not serfs. So even though they were used as forced labour, they were not the types to lose their initiative just like that. Before, during, and after Coen’s kidnapping, because of their enterprise, some in the Chinese community were able to become rich. They traded in agricultural produce (pepper, tea and silk), but they thrived especially as traders of export goods, in both the traditional trade with China as well as the trade with Europe.

  

But, Hs-y, wherever corruption prevails, as it did in the time of Coen, and wherever the love of money dominates, then viciousness is sure to make its presence felt. And so it was at the beginning of the eighteenth century. This was the way the corrupt agents of colonialism went after money: extortion was committed against the Chinese, whether or not they had papers. They were harassed in almost every way imaginable. These officials helped generate a general anti-Chinese sentiment. They were exiled, killed, tortured and shot in order to squeeze money out of them, even from the most empty of pockets. I say ‘empty pockets’ because the Chinese have also had to deal with the myth that they are all rich. This is not true. But it has to be admitted that no matter how empty the Chinese pockets might have been, they were not quite as empty as the pockets of the local people. You need to understand the social structure at the time. It was like a pyramid. At the top were the Dutch, who ruled over and terrorised all those who were under them.

  

Immediately under them were the nobility, who, in their turn, also oppressed and terrorised the people. So the people bore the weight of two layers of oppression. The position of the people was virtually that of slaves. According to Western observers who wrote about Banten in the sixteenth century, almost all work was done by slaves. We can draw the conclusion that work itself was a degrading activity, that of slaves.

  

Beside the pyramid stood the merchants: Chinese, locals, Portuguese, Indians, Arabs, British and most especially, Dutch. All of them also exploited the people. So there was a true international exploitation. Hs-y, I have not included the merchants in the pyramid because they were not under the terror of either the nobility or the Dutch. They cooperated with everybody – the nobility, the Dutch and the people.

  

And why did the colonialists want to get rid of the Chinese? The first reason was that there were more Chinese than there were Dutch. And the Dutch found that they could only use the nobility as instruments of colonisation. History had shown that they had not been able to use the Chinese for this purpose! Second, the long and rich culture of the Chinese meant that they were in a position to stand as strong as the colonising whites. (So it was racial discrimination that gave rise to political discrimination, but also taking the form of economic discrimination!) Third, the Dutch needed to defend white domination on a global scale. So Dutch soldiers and sailors agitated the slaves, the ordinary people, to attack the Chinese, something that happened when anti-Chinese feeling reached its zenith in the eighteenth century. Behind the soldiers and sailors stood Governor General Valckenier, who also ordered the execution of all Chinese prisoners. But the Chinese could not stand by in the face of this barbarity. They fought back and, outside of the towns, formed armed brigades. In Batavia, the Chinese were killed en masse – babies, men, women, grandmothers, widows, young men, young women. At least ten thousand people were killed! That is how unproductive history can be, if a country has a Governor General!²

  

The bloodbath unleashed by Governor General Valckenier created a new name, the name of a river, Kali Angke. In the Fukien dialect, this means Red River. And do not assume that the local people remained silent throughout all this. Though they had the social status of slaves, or even just animals, they were in fact still human beings. And, as human beings, they could not let the noble nature of humanity be violated. Perhaps also because they had not forgotten the rebellions by Surapati³ and Pieter Eberfeld⁴, or perhaps they could see that the barbaric actions of the colonisers would one day be directed at them, the people also rose up and supported the Chinese. Fighting broke out everywhere, eventually spreading to Semarang and Surakarta. In Surakarta, the Pakubuwono⁵ joined in and were inspired also to rise up against the colonisers. The important thing here is that the Indonesian people helped this resistance. (See also Dr. Prijono, Sedikit tentang Sejarah Asia Timur Raya dan Sejarah Tanah Jawa).

  

Hs-y, you have, no doubt heard the name Multatuli⁶, have you not? Even though he has hardly ever been mentioned in the school texts used here in Indonesia? Multatuli was once accused of unfairly depicting the Javanese (Multatuli, Ideen, Vierde Bundel), with the words:

  

This is in miniature the roaring of the dissatisfied fool who’s in adversity and accuses and curses the world, as if the Japanese and Chinese are responsible for his misfortune.

  

As vague as these words might be, they reveal some kind of general fear of the Chinese, and the Japanese as well. (I think there is a new fear of the Japanese now, but in the context of imperialist cooperation.) They are being put in a difficult position, targeted for provocation. This fear is very general, and I think those in power also only have a very general perception of the Chinese. We can forgive Multatuli for hardly mentioning the Chinese at all in his descriptions of life in Banten. The Chinese had very little presence in Banten at that time. Banten had to be destroyed as a harbour and entrepôt. So the Dutch dragged the Chinese away from Banten and to Batavia. Banten collapsed and Batavia grew as a port. It would not have been so easy to move the Chinese from Banten to Batavia if Banten itself had not been in such tumult as a result of the fighting between Sultan Ageng and Sultan Haji (1683)⁷, not to mention wave after wave of Dutch blockades of Banten. The Dutch knew well how to use funds and forces. Banten collapsed in the end because it became starved of all its funds and forces. I do not mean to say that the people of Banten were no longer productive and that there was no longer any pepper being produced. No! But with the people more or less in the position of slaves, we cannot really expect them to be optimally productive. But the Chinese in Banten were not slaves; they were free people. Their fortunes did not depend on their loyalty to a master but upon their own efforts.

  

Hs-y, it was the colonialists, afraid that the Chinese might take their place, who first planted the anti-Chinese clichés. Even though the Chinese never did anything to deserve being targeted, these clichés were later taken up by other non-Chinese bourgeois. But the ordinary people did not take up these anti-Chinese sentiments. They had nothing to gain, and neither would they gain anything if the anti-Chinese elements gained a victory. This was proven by history. The people actually helped the rebellion of the Chinese. The people also preferred to sell their produce to the Chinese rather than to white people. This was proven in 1655. The Dutch seized 4,000 sacks of pepper from a Chinese ship on the Musi River, and then the people joined with Chinese to wreak revenge on the Dutch. Forty-two Dutch were killed and twenty people captured (Dr. de Graaf, Geschiedenis van Indonesia). De Graaf also produced some other facts that the people of South Borneo also preferred to sell their pepper to the Chinese. In an expedition aimed at conquering the area and expanding the Spanish territories to Maluku, the Chinese sailors also rebelled, killing the commander and causing the whole mission to fail.

  

Anti-Chinese sentiment was systematically generated by those in power. It then spread to the bourgeoisie, that is, the non-Chinese capitalists. Then politicians took them over, thinking that these sentiments were popular sentiments, and they then used them to justify some of their actions, as the basis to get support from some elements in society or to protect and expand their own capital and power.

  

In a speech in November 1959, Njoto⁸ gave the name of the Dutch right-wing social democrat, Jef Last, as the person who first used the term ‘fifth column’. It was Last who said that the Chinese, including Indonesians of Chinese descent, were a fifth column. This idea was then swallowed, digested and reproduced again by Dzulkifli Hafas, the editor of Nusantara newspaper, who spread it to the public still using the same term: ‘Fifth Column!’

  

But, Hs-y, if Jef Last was really honest, could he really say that he loves the Indonesian people so much that he needs to give us such a warning about coming dangers? Are these dangers real? Not just a fantasy? Why is Jef Last making these statements? If he is not speaking to the Indonesian people – and I do not think that is possible – then to whom is he speaking?

  

Is he not actually speaking for Dutch interests? Is he not really interested in using his influence in such a way as to encourage the Indonesian government to take action against the Chinese and thereby throw the Indonesian economy into chaos? Yes, it is chaos that occurs in many places as a result of PP 10. I do not know. And do not forget, the term ‘fifth column’ is always used to link the Chinese to the PRC! The depiction of the Chinese as a fifth column is also a tactic of the anticommunist movement. And the anticommunist movement also operates on an international level. Everything is linked together in such a way that it can have an impact before any government can break out of these links. So we hear, for example, from Kyodo News that the former Japanese Prime Minister, Shigeru Yoshida, complained after his trip around Southeast Asia that anticommunist sentiment was strong in all the neutral countries except Indonesia. Before that, we heard a report from the PIA in Bonn that the Indonesian ambassador to West Germany, Mr. Zairin Sain, who had been a former advisor to the head of the Dutch delegation at the U.N. in 1946, had made a statement about the Chinese traders in Indonesia:

  

... [they] were typical representatives of reactionary capitalism. The Chinese in Indonesia have such a great influence on trade and commerce that their manipulations were a grave danger to economic stability in Indonesia.

  

Meanwhile the PIA published a report from AFP [Agence France Presse] from Manila, that:

  

The Philippines Government was startled to hear that more than 600 Chinese residents in the Philippines had been naturalised in 1946.

  

Hs-y, these three reports were published one after the other in the third week of December 1959. In just one week! I have just brought these reports to your notice, not all the others. But it should be clear how the international anti-Chinese and anticommunist movements are intertwined, including in the press. In order that you can better understand the international efforts to destabilise the Southeast Asian economies, especially that of Indonesia, I have prepared a chronicle of some of the recent incidents affecting the Chinese here.

  

Anti-Chinese sentiments were systematically developed by the Dutch. This happened even during the revolution, when Dutch spies further agitated anti-Chinese sentiments, resulting in the mass killings in Tangerang in 1946⁹. I say that this was the work of spies because action against the Chinese during the revolution only made more enemies for the revolution. And the revolution needed friends in order to be able to defeat its enemies. It is idiocy to make enemies of people who are not enemies before the real enemy is defeated. And, even until now, the Chinese are not the enemy of the Indonesian people, even though they appear as the enemy of the Indonesian bourgeoisie and other non-Chinese bourgeoisie. In this war among the bourgeoisie, big and small, they are prepared to resort to the lowest tactics, including dragging the people into their war.

  

Hs-y, do not think that the Indonesian people are so easily confused, even though they may often remain silent.

  

The 1945 August Revolution proved that the Indonesian people would fight to defend themselves and their country at any time, whenever necessary. It is only those who have become somewhat unbalanced or cannot recognise their own weaknesses who are most thrilled with all the din about the Chinese. The people are not joining in any of this. Meanwhile, the progressive forces understand that the improvement of economic conditions does not come from simply changing the economic actors but from transforming the basis of the national economy. This needs to be in accordance with the challenges of the times and to provide justice to all Indonesian citizens, that is, it needs to be a socialist economic system.

  

What can we say; a high official dealing with the Chinese situation has now issued a statement articulating negative facts about the Chinese. He has concentrated on the illegal acts of individuals and made it look like all Chinese in Indonesia are a bunch of evil bastards. This statement has emboldened both the domestic and foreign press, connected as they are to the interests of the international anti-Chinese and anticommunist movements. The pressure put on the Chinese sometimes gets out of control; sometimes their accusers refer to them again as economic saboteurs, forgetting to refer to them as the fifth column. Sometimes they are described as an evil group and then made even more evil because of their loyalty to the PRC. They are the target of all sorts of attacks; they are placed in the dock and charged with being both official and unofficial enemies of humanity.

  

But none of this propaganda ever actually gets to the important question: What economic system is best for Indonesia? And then how should it be implemented? What are its stages? How should it be regulated, and what needs to be done during the period of transition? Both the local and foreign press, working together with the international anticommunist movement, are completely silent about all these issues.

  

Choosing PRC Citizenship is Not a Crime

  

Hs-y, nationalism is something new in Asia. Especially in Indonesia. Previously, nationality was not a factor in relations between the inhabitants of Indonesia. They related to each other as human being to human being; they mixed as members of one family. The rise of nationalism put barriers between the peoples of Asia, making them aliens to each other. By using the word ‘alien’, I mean this in a formal way. Now we are entering such a new period. So this has caused a kind of awkwardness between us, but this is not a reason for enmity between us. In the meantime, let us examine the fuel that is used to inflame anti-Chinese feelings.

  

There is the example of the Poh An Tui¹⁰. This is used as an argument against the Chinese. It was even mentioned by Subandrio¹¹ in his letter to Chen Yi¹². Let us put this under the light so we can see things clearly. Where now are the members of Poh An Tui? Now, after the victory of Indonesian nationalism, which citizenship should they choose? Indonesia, PRC or Taiwan? If they become Indonesians, how is that possible? Who made the rules that turned them into Indonesian citizens?

  

Obviously it was not Taiwan, nor was it the PRC. If we want to make something of the Poh An Tui incident, then let us investigate it properly so that we can actually learn something and not just use it to agitate. Nobody will gain any legitimate benefit simply from agitation. Why has there been no effort to collect real evidence about this event? It is precisely because there is no clear evidence about Poh An Tui that it is possible to use this incident to inflame hatred against the Chinese. People from East Sumatra and Medan in particular, can tell you now what happened to the members of the Poh An Tui. There are a number of writers and journalists who were citizens in East Sumatra who know what really befell those Poh An Tui people. Now, in the midst of the campaign of hate against the Chinese, they are nowhere to be heard. Perhaps they are just trying to protect themselves or the positions that they hold, positions which they do not fully deserve or which they do not deserve at all.

  

I think it might be important, Hs-y, to relate how there is a very large number of stateless Chinese in Jambi [Sumatra] who are sympathisers of the Kuomintang in Taiwan. There were just a few score Chinese in Jambi who chose PRC citizenship. The newspaper Fikiran Rakyat in Palembang reported on 22 August 1959 that these stateless Chinese had also been involved in the regional revolts of 1957 and the beginning of 1958¹³. Some fled overseas, but some also helped supply the rebels. So I wonder, Hs-y, how we relate to these stateless Chinese if we do not know to whom they are loyal. Does being without nationality mean they have no loyalty to any country? Is it going too far then, to draw the provisional or even final conclusion that such people indeed have no sense of loyalty and in fact, are people who cannot be trusted? Why is it not these people who are taken issue with first? Why is it that those with Chinese citizenship, who have made that clear choice for a specific country – and a friendly country at that – are held responsible for all the crimes of the liberal economy, which itself is a legacy of history? I really do not understand the whole din around the so-called Chinese question. Junior Minister for Information Maladi announced, for example, that the Indonesian government would not be changing the rules regarding foreign nationals (from the PRC) in Indonesia. Antara reported him saying this in Surabaya in October 1959. Such a statement is not oriented towards strengthening the system of a guided economy, which all the people of Indonesia support, or aimed at improving its implementation. It is only making an issue of whether somebody is a foreigner, whether he is or is not a native of Indonesia! No matter how you look at such a statement, it always comes back to the question of the nationality of an individual and not really to the question of what is best for the national economy. Nobody seems to be looking at this issue, despite the fact that the din about the Chinese question is crashing on our ears every day.

  

Hs-y, given that this is an issue of unresolved nationality, I cannot support the demonstrations that the PRC has organised – at least according to press reports, if they are true – to respond to the anti-Chinese actions in Indonesia. If we cannot support one irrational act, then surely we cannot also support another such act. I think that responding to one irrational act with another is not just unproductive. And I have to admit also that here the new spirit of the revolution is sometimes being suffocated by an older spirit. There seems sometimes to be a kind of indigestion, where people cannot understand what flows from our independence and what is actually a legacy of the colonial era. People cannot understand, or do not want to understand, that China after 1949 is not the China of previous eras and that Indonesia after 1945 is also not the Indonesia of before. We are often confronted with confusions, whether deliberate or not, I do not know. This is caused by the older spirit not being able to comprehend the issues of independence.

  

Perhaps there will be those who accuse me of being anti-national because of these views. [North Sumatra Governor] Kumala Pontas, for example, has accused all those who try to prevent the implementation of PP 10 of treason. Any such person is welcome to bring me before any tribunal to investigate whether I am anti-national or not. Perhaps because I am not burdened by any position, it is easier for me to be objective about this issue. It is only my desire to protect the good relations between Indonesia and the PRC, and even more so, the internal social, economic and political development of Indonesia, that I reject all these confusions spread by others. And so I am forced to put forward these ideas. But wait, I have still not finished speaking.

  

For the first time since 1950, there have been attempts at the international level to calm the anti-Chinese sentiments. Where? In Peking itself. It was the journalist Mh. Tabrani who raised the issue directly with Chou En-lai! Tabrani went to China in 1952 to attend the May Day celebrations. Tabrani asked Chou En-lai:

  

What is the Chinese policy towards all the Chinese who live overseas in the many Southeast Asian countries? Are they prepared to become citizens of the countries where they now live, or are they to be used as part of a Chinese plan for expansion in Asia?

  

I quote this very undiplomatic question to a diplomat from a book by the journalist and member of the Indian National Congress, Raja Hutheesing, who is also author of The Great Peace (according to the translation of Iskandar Situmorang). Hutheesing came to Indonesia a few years ago at the invitation of the Indonesian government. I do not know why he was here. I do know that in his book he wrote about his visit to China, but in the usual style of an Indian intellectual: with pretensions to be the champion of Asian culture, unwilling to acknowledge the achievements of other Asian nations. As if he were some kind of detective out to catch a burglar, he expressed his suspicions about everything he saw and heard while he was there. These suspicions were just the polite form of what otherwise emerged as an explicit statement: Everybody lies in the PRC.

  

I do not know how the Indonesian press reported Tabrani’s question. I do not have any documentation. But Chou did reply, as noted in Hutheesing’s book. Chou replied at the time, and subsequently, he also sent a written reply. Chou replied in writing like this:

  

In my opinion, because we all are from nations that have suffered foreign colonisation or are still suffering this, we must be able to understand each other. So Mr. Tabrani and the Indonesian delegation must be able to understand that the Chinese nation, which has awoken after such a long period of oppression, has great sympathy for all the peoples of the world who suffer colonisation, most especially the people of Asia. We cannot deny that in the feudal era our ancestors launched aggression against our neighbours such as Korea and Vietnam. These were crimes of the feudal era, crimes of the feudal government of China. We admit all this. We have now expelled the colonisers and overthrown the feudal rulers. Today’s people’s democracy will never repeat such aggression. I am sure that the Indonesian delegation has already experienced here in Peking how happy the Chinese people have been to welcome you. I am sure you will find the same thing if you visit other areas. The new China rejects all aggression towards other countries. Finally, I should just say that the former colonisers now spread stories about China, saying that China is preparing to start aggressive action against other countries. Their aim is to break any unity among us. Can you really believe their stories? Their purpose is to create conflict and suspicion among us so as to make their own aggression easier. Let all the peace-loving countries of the world unite and plant deep in our thoughts an old, well-known saying: Beware of the pickpocket!

  

Hs-y, it is a pity that Chou did not say anything about citizenship in his reply. But in the book by Raja Hutheesing, book there are some notes on how Chou answered at the time.

  

The issue of citizenship is a new issue. Several Southeast Asian countries have now formulated citizenship laws. We are very pleased to start discussions of this question. We understand that now the people have won their independence they may be suspicious of anything foreign. But we must always trust in the facts.

  

Of course, just as with Raja Hutheesing, there will be many sceptical Indonesians who will say: Ah, that is just the public line. Hs-y, the question now is whether or not China will be able to rebut these sceptics with deeds.

  

I am not competent to intervene on this issue. But, oh, how many people there are on this earth that have such pretences. At the beginning of 1957, I gave a lecture on China. There was one person who attended, a sceptic and critic who claimed also to be a philosopher. But he went to sleep in order to show how unimportant he thought the lecture was. Of course, I am not going to claim that the talk was especially important. But whether or not it was important is not worth debating now. The key thing is to understand that nations are now awakening. The amazing thing was that the sleeping person suddenly announced his views the next day over the radio: My lecture was like a hymn! No different than the bulletins issued by the PRC embassy! My goodness! It appears that a sleeping philosopher can also develop opinions, and they were broadcast on government radio, no less. Then it turned out that this critic, sceptic, and philosopher was no more than a teacher at a Kuomintang school. He only realised that he had been a teacher of KMT cadres after the Indonesian government banned KMT activities. Perhaps he should be called the father of the new KMT. Or maybe the grandfather of the new KMT in Indonesia. What a tragic story of a radio philosopher with no philosophy!

  

In 1952, a professor from the University of Indonesia, himself of foreign descent, whispered to me, “Vigilance, Pram! The Chinese are a danger standing right there at the door!” And, at the beginning of 1956, a military officer warned me, of course in his capacity as an individual, “The Chinese are a threat already inside our home. If the chance should arise...”

  

How mixed up is all this!

  

Are the Chinese here so politically conscious [i.e., with a political agenda of their own] that they themselves cause all these whispering attacks? I do not think that their consciousness is that high. If we read the book about Lie Kim Hok (1853-1912)¹⁴ by Tio Ie Soei, with all its historical background, we can see that their political consciousness is very shallow, although it must be acknowledged that they do have some politics. During the struggle against the Dutch, there were very few Chinese among the ‘politicians in the making’. Colonel Amir Mahmud, the Bandung KMKB War Commander, told a gathering of Indonesian citizens of foreign descent that the Indonesian state does not recognise terms such as ‘genuine native’ and ‘non-native’.

  

In the period of the struggle for Indonesian independence, besides native Indonesian names, we also find names that indicate foreign descent, such as Liem Koen Hian and Douwes Dekker.

  

Is it really the case, though, that political consciousness among Indonesian Chinese is so shallow? It might be useful in this respect to quote from a report by Tan Eng Kie when he was editor of Kengpo. This report was published in the American journal Atlantic Monthly and was titled ‘The Question of Minorities’:

  

Recently I asked several inhabitants of Benteng whether they thought of one day returning to China; without exception they said No. I asked them who Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Tse-tung were. They didn’t know. One of them explained, We here only know how to be farmers; we don’t know anything about the news. We never heard it.

  

They did know, however, that the Father of the State is President Soekarno. And one of the farmers said wistfully, I’ve heard the name of President Soekarno, but I have never seen his face. When I asked what it meant to become an Indonesian citizen, one of them replied, We are one with the Indonesian people. Where else could we live? In other places we would be abandoned and neglected.

  

For such simple people, the passive system of attaining citizenship was most appropriate. Nor need we worry about their being used by Red China as a fifth column.

  

Hs-y, if you read closely, there are several strange things to be found in these paragraphs. Let me explain a little. Benteng is another name for Tangerang, which is a town midway between two regions. The name ‘benteng’ [fort] originated from its history. It was there that the Dutch East Indies Company built a fort on the Cisadene River, which forms the border between Banten and Batavia. The fort was used as the base for fending off military forces or bandit gangs from Banten. One of the reasons that there were many Chinese in Tangerang is that many of them were exiles fleeing the conflict between the Dutch and Banten during the period when the Dutch were chasing the Chinese out of Banten. Some would also have been exiles from the Valckenier Incident. This is my suspicion anyway. If I am right, then it is certain that no matter how isolated a community situation they might find themselves in, they would have heard many stories warning them to be vigilant and careful.

  

Second, there is no way that the Chinese living there would have forgotten the 1946 Tangerang Incident. They would be very careful in what they said. Third, it is impossible that none of them would have heard of Chiang Kai-shek or Mao Tse-tung, even though most of them are illiterate. The fact that Jakarta is not far away and not a difficult journey means that news certainly would have reached them quite quickly, even if only by word of mouth. Fourth, the statement by one of them that they had “heard the name of Soekarno” is also a bit odd. Soekarno’s name was not something new for Indonesians. It was around even before the Japanese occupation. This especially would have been the case in Tangerang. At the height of political and military activity, on 9 December 1945, Bung Karno [i.e., Soekarno], Bung Hatta¹⁵, the attorney general, the cabinet secretary, and several other officials of the Republic passed through Tangerang on their way to Banten. Thousands of people came out to welcome the official entourage. In Tangerang itself, thousands also gathered. The president and vice-president both spoke to the masses to thank the people of Tangerang and to urge them to keep up the struggle for country, people, and religion. I do not think that we can accept so easily Tan Eng-kie’s report. The other funny element was when he mentioned the fifth column, saying that no such thing existed among the Chinese of Benteng. But it is clear that he does think such a fifth column exists; yes, it is just a part of his fantasy world.

  

Tan Eng-kie has deliberately linked the issue of the fifth column with Indonesian citizenship. Once again we find an example of the slippery combination of truth, half-truth and no truth at all with the fantasy of someone. A whole people have to suffer the consequences of this fantasising by a small group of people. One of the grating things, too, is that the fifth column issue is always mentioned in relation to Red China. Why is it never raised in relation to other countries – Taiwan for example? Of course not, the whole mythology of the PRC Chinese fifth column is part of the cliché that it must be the fault of the communists, the communists are rotten, and communism itself is a manifestation of evil. Such kinds of assertions are the product of unbalanced minds. As I have said to you earlier: Good can be found everywhere, and the same applies to rotten things.

  

Hatta also contributed an article, on the economy, of course, to the same journal, entitled ‘Facets of Indonesia’s Economy’. He also mentioned the Chinese, but very cautiously and without using the term ‘fifth column’. But still his approach gives us indigestion:

  

The Indonesian was poor in the midst of overflowing wealth. Those with money were the foreigners who ruled the country; they had authority, capital and their technical skill. Next to the Dutch, the best off were the Chinese, who were their chief helpers in business and administration, and formed, as it were, a middle class.

  

So Hatta has very carefully positioned the Chinese as helpers to the Dutch in commerce and government! It is very sad that it is indeed a former vice-president who is speaking like this. Hs-y, I say sad because it is a statement that reveals that Hatta does not understand much about the history of his own country.

  

Syahrir¹⁶ also wrote for the same magazine about ‘Problems the Country Faces’. He does not mention the Chinese even once. So you can see, Hs-y, why I might feel frustrated that none of our political commanders have given any time to study the Chinese question scientifically. I myself find it strange that none of them seem interested in studying such a serious issue. Because of this lack of attention and study, it is very easy for the Chinese to be turned into scapegoats by anybody and everybody. The lack of clarity in the position of these politicians has made it easier for the Chinese to become easy prey for political wheelers and dealers, which is what is happening today.

  

In this Christmas atmosphere, I pray that little by little, the officials, the power-wielders, and, not least, the leaders of the people will set aside some of their time to study the history of minorities in Indonesia, as well as study more about their own people. Maybe this way, in the very near future, we might reach a situation where not a single person or group ends up a victim of some outrageous political scenario. Such acts are truly shallow, violating the most elementary principles of humanity. It is a basic right of any Chinese to choose PRC citizenship, whether actively or passively. At the very least, they are giving their loyalty to a country. It means we know who they are; they are not some rootless group in society. We must respect the citizenship that people choose for themselves. If we develop antipathy for some foreign group for one reason or another, then the solution must be found by following decent methods, respecting elementary principles. Has the tumult around the Chinese respected such principles? The facts tell the story here, Hs-y. PRC citizenship is not a crime.

  

It is Not Wisdom to Expel People From Their Livelihood

  

There is an agreement to buy surplus agricultural products from the United States! And there is no news whether the case of certain elements in Singapore falsifying the quality of PRC rice destined for Singapore is going to court. At least I have not heard any such news. The whole commotion around the Chinese issue has developed through very unique, though very systematically organised, incidents.

  

Responding to this, one official in the PRC embassy here explained that Chinese capital in Indonesia was not foreign capital but, rather, domestic capital. It was impossible for any profits to be transferred out of the country, nor was it ever likely that the capital itself would leave Indonesia.

  

The very next day, Rahmat Muljomiseno, Minister of Trade at the time, rejected this statement, saying that domestic Chinese capital could not be considered domestic capital but must be viewed as foreign capital. Meanwhile, this domestic capital that must be considered foreign capital still cannot be transferred out of the country, meaning to the homeland of the foreign person concerned. Rahmat Muljomiseno even issued a warning against the spreading of confusion on the issue. Perhaps, Hs-y, Rahmat Muljomiseno hopes that his policies will provide some benefit to the people. I do not know. Only his own conscience can answer that question. But it is clear that his politics are wrong or he is one of those politicians who does not understand politics. Somebody who understands this issue and is honestly working to advance the economy of the people would be looking for ways to strengthen the economic capacity of the people. This means expanding domestic capital, capital in the hands of the people. Rahmat could have issued a statement reaffirming the statement by the PRC embassy that Chinese domestic capital was indeed domestic and not foreign capital. If someone like Asaat¹⁷ came out with an explicit statement urging discrimination in commerce on the grounds of foreign citizenship, then we would not be so startled. We know he is just an economic adventurer out to seek whatever money he can. But when a senior official, a minister, can make such an error – for some other purpose or, indeed, just by mistake – we cannot avoid feeling some suspicion. Whose voice is this? But meanwhile, anti-Chinese sentiment spreads further through all the trade and commerce channels. Let me tell you.

  

There has been a lot of talk about guided economy as part of a guided democracy. Even now it is not clear who is supposed to guide the economy. If it is the national bourgeoisie, it will be just like going from the duck pen into the chicken coop. The Indonesian bourgeoisie was poised and ready to make use of Minister Rahmat Muljomiseno’s decree of 14 May 1959. It appears that they were prepared for the decision because they held their own conference in Puncak (in Puncak!) on 11-13 May and urged the government to listen to their wishes. As bait, the conference stated that they accepted neither a liberal nor totalitarian system. Then this national bourgeoisie-in-the-making demanded laws to regulate who would be national businesses. You can see their lust to control the national economy. It was just one day later that Rahmat returned to the podium with a little philosophy: We must seek the road to adjusting to a guided economy and to finding the national character together. But he gave no explanation as to what constituted a guided economy or a national character. Still, based on this little bit of philosophy, he did promise this rather spoiled national bourgeoisie that there would be a place for private endeavour in the framework of a guided economy. Guided economy seems a very vague concept when it comes to setting out its relationship to the national bourgeoisie.

  

From that time onwards, the attacks on the Chinese began, especially the attacks on the Chinese retailers in the villages. Their capital adds up to 3 billion [rupiah], says one. No, it is 2.3 billion, says the Indonesian Cooperatives Movement, and comprises 16% of all the foreign capital invested in Indonesia. More strident voices: Dangerous capital! Subandrio, in an interview with Antara at the end of July 1959, stated:

  

So long as our state does not have mastery over the national economy, foreign capital is a threat. And aid in the form of credit from overseas is better than allowing foreign capital to invest in Indonesia.

  

So Subandrio thinks that foreign capital is dangerous, but he does not oppose it if the Indonesian national economy has become strong. The problem is located elsewhere. If we talk about a strong national economy, whose economy is it that needs to be strong? That of the national bourgeoisie? Of the people? Of the government? Certainly I do not have the right to present an answer to these complicated economic questions. But if the idea is that the strength of the national economy is to be measured by the strength of the national bourgeoisie, I do not agree! In the meantime, at the Fifth Congress of the Metropolitan Jakarta branch of the Indonesian Central Labour Organisation (SOBSI) on 26 July 1959 – that is to say, in the midst of the first round of the Chinese question hubbub – the following data was released: Large-scale foreign capital (which does have the right to transfer money out of the country) repatriated profits (either legally or illegally) to the value of approximately 15 billion rupiah! And that is not all! To this 15 billion from the earth and the sweat of Indonesian workers and farmers must be added all the profits that foreign capital makes from its privileged rights over the foreign exchange earned by exports from our oil fields.

  

Hs-y, our budget is in deficit every year by 2.6 billion rupiah! How ironic!

  

Let us compare all this with the Chinese capital in the villages. Three billion. Or 2.3 billion according to the Indonesian Cooperatives Council. And this is capital in circulation! Besides this stands the 15 billion being exported out of Indonesia by big foreign capital! What a joke! You can imagine for yourself how these statistics dance like Satan. And in the midst of this dance of statistics there are those who draw the conclusion: Because of all this, the Chinese peddler capital in the villages is a big danger! A danger to the security of the Indonesian national economy! How funny! Everybody knows that this 3 or 2.3 billion will not leave Indonesia. But the larger amount, the 15 billion that does flee Indonesia, is not seen as a danger to the national economy.

  

As a correction to all these facts, the racialists, or should we say the itchy-fingered bourgeoisie, then launched a new theory: It is not the Chinese capital that is dangerous, but the Chinese themselves! Their capital is fine; I will take it, too, if you give it to me. But the whole attack on the Chinese could actually result in Indonesia losing capital if their human rights were fully acknowledged and they were allowed to take any property that they have lawfully earned here back to their homeland. I say human rights because they must be recognised formally as foreign citizens. And, as foreign citizens, they have carried out their responsibilities to the state. If their rights were recognised, then Indonesia, so poor in capital, would only become poorer.

  

Then there may be another official who confronts this whole issue in grand style with the statement: We can get the capital we need from Japan. In that case, there is no need to talk about foreign capital being a danger. Very well, perhaps that is okay as regards their funds, but what about actual forces? Perhaps this imaginary official would also answer: No matter; we can import them from Japan also! In that case, Japan would gain what they were not able to win through World War II. They could launch an offensive into Indonesia without arms. In the midst of the holiness of Christmas Eve, I pray that our political commanders of the day be given the courage they need to face up to the issues of the day; that they do not procrastinate or hide from these problems while at the same time making certain groups scapegoats in society. May they have enough strength of character so they do not end up bequeathing all these troubles and others to their grandchildren.

  

I have tried to explain this question. Can you understand what I am getting at? It is on this basis that I am prepared to state clearly that the expulsion of the Chinese from their arena of livelihood without the preparation worthy of the actions of humans towards other humans is unfair, unjust and lowers our national dignity. And if I speak about the human rights of the Chinese, whether they are acknowledged or not, the facts, too, speak out on this. For example, there is this report from Antara, mid-June 1959, from Surabaya:

  

The Customs Service banned 200 Chinese youth leaving to return to the PRC on 9 June from taking mattresses on board their ship. About 150 new thick mattresses that were being taken by the youths to China and which they stated were their property were banned from being put on board. It was ordered that the mattresses be returned to free circulation.

  

This is just one example. There are many other examples, many officially recognised. (Just look at all the regulations that are being reported by the press.) Meanwhile Junior Information Minister Maladi announced to Antara that Indonesia would not be altering any of its regulations towards foreigners. Full stop, no commas.

  

So five hundred thousand people, the families of shopkeepers and traders, are being expelled without anyone knowing how they will look after themselves. There are not even plans to help them put rice on their tables.

  

Needed: Understanding, Not Uproar

  

Naturally all the hate campaigning against the Chinese only ever presents the victims as being bad. Why must it be just from one angle? Well, actually, the reason is clear. The hate campaigners are afraid to see the positive side of their victims, the good side. That, too, is why these campaigners only ever present their own good side and never admit their own limitations and failures. I cannot agree with that kind of approach. In this discussion of the whole fifth column myth, we can see who constitutes the real fifth column. If we do not want to use that term, then we can say it another way: they are the layer of compradors to big foreign capital, both that which is already here as well as that which will be entering later.

  

The free and active foreign policy of Indonesia is a great achievement. Yet even the most glorious inventions depend in the end on the morals and skills of those implementing them. Such has been the case throughout history.

  

Hs-y, a sane mind cannot defend the agitation against the Chinese. The longer this letter has grown, the more I understand why I cannot accept this kind of policy. I cannot adopt any other position. When suddenly one group in society is subjected to this kind of agitation, then surely other groups will soon also become targets. Our national potential will be undermined as a result. Such is always the case! History has shown us that this is what happens. One round after another of finding scapegoats until finally common sense itself becomes the scapegoat. I know, too, that these campaigns will not make the Indonesian people smarter, but only more confused. Nobody will be allowed to advance, except insofar as they are encouraged to hate more people. People will just get dizzy, caught up in a never-ending devil’s circle, whether or not there is even a devil around.

  

This is why I will try to present another side of the Chinese in Indonesia.

## The Social Position of the Chinese is the Result of a Long Process of Social Historical Development

  

Hs-y,

  

My guess was right. There has been a reaction already. Somebody has stated something to the effect that Pramoedya says that the Chinese did not ask to be made a middle class. So does he think we Indonesians appointed them? Huh? Or, on the other hand, is Pramoedya hiding the fact that he is actually speaking for Peking? Finding a way to position hundreds of thousands of Chinese in the villages of Indonesia?

  

These comments do not really represent any kind of counter argument; they are more just a few confused and bitter writings. However, they do touch on two issues that I need to discuss. The first is the issue of the social position of the Chinese in Indonesia, and the second is the demographics of the Chinese population here. In this letter I want to take up the particular subject of the relatively good social position of the Chinese.

  

Hs-y, forgive me if this letter of mine to you also ends up being read by the person who responded in the ways I mentioned above. He is a rather well known person and was at one time, I think, a candidate for the position of cabinet minister from one of the political parties. He was a rather important person at that time, when the political game was at a particular point. But I do not think there is any need for either us to heed his name.

  

Before I begin, can you just note that when I use the term ‘merchant middleman’, this does not refer to the same phenomenon that is denoted by this term in Europe, nor perhaps in China either (see Dr. Liem Twan Djie, Die Distribuerende Tusschenhandel der Chineezen op Java). ‘Merchant middleman’ in Indonesia has a special meaning. I will be discussing the social position of the Chinese in this letter and deal more with this issue when I write about economics later. So if I mention ‘merchant middleman’, I hope you can be patient and wait for a fuller explanation later on.

  

The First Social System: Not Yet Any Trade?

  

The very early Indonesian societies were not familiar with trade as we know it today. These were totally agrarian societies, developed to a high level with sophisticated irrigation systems. They were not peoples given to travelling, but rather, they tended to stay put in one spot. These were very homogeneous societies because they were geographically isolated and faced so many dangers from outside. This social system is often referred to as ‘primitive communism’. Everybody worked for everybody. Everybody was cared for and looked after by everybody. Nobody had more than another, so these societies produced no kings, such leaders, and elders. There was no trade or commerce as such in these societies because everybody produced about the same amount and production belonged to all. That there was some exchange between people in the interior and on the coast makes sense, of course. But we cannot really call this trade, as there was still no pricing or other mechanism to determine value. There was just the exchange of needed goods, with no supply and demand mechanism operating, as is required for real commerce to take place.

  

We can still find a few such societies in the interior of Kalimantan, although we need note that they have experienced some degeneration, some backward movement, or little progress. Not every generation can successfully build on its traditions so that some kind of change, backwards or forwards, is always likely to occur. There can be small changes, too, if such a society starts to have contact with the outside world. For example, the needs of certain tribes to obtain salt, beads or mirrors from the Dayaks started some primitive trade. This opened up the possibility for all kinds of deceit and exploitation by the more advanced traders. That is why, Hs-y, you can find some kings in Kalimantan who started as traders, such as Sultan Hamid or [Rajah James] Brooke in North Kalimantan.

  

The First Transformations: Social Differentiation, Primitive Commerce

  

This social system changed once Hindus arrived, bringing feudalism with them.

  

Feudalism, providing the pillars of Hinduism, is characterised by two key features: concentration of force (requiring the development of militarism) and concentration of power (requiring the development of a rigid social hierarchy). These two elements work together. The concentration of power is impossible without the concentration of force. And all this is impossible without oppressing and exploiting the people, their labour, wealth and lives. Such a system requires a great deal of money. There is some remaining evidence of this reported in the slim book by Prijono, Sedikit tentang Sedjarah Asia Timoer Raya, where he explains how Sultan Agung Mataram (1613-1645)¹ could mobilise two hundred thousand soldiers in half a day. And if it costs 50 rupiah per day in the currency today [1960] to maintain each soldier, then that would cost at least one million rupiah. Where did they get such amounts? From stealing from and exploiting the labour, wealth and lives of the people, of course.

  

Hs-y, as feudal Hinduism spread through Indonesia, there began to emerge kingdoms headed by all-powerful kings. The social system changed to a feudal system, in accordance with Hindu teachings and the Hindu caste system. But, in essence, there were just two layers. In one were the king and feudal officials who held all the power in their hands. In the other were the people. The people suffered every kind of treatment at the hands of those wielding power.

  

This was the first period in Indonesian history where the people were turned into workhorses. The people were forced to serve the upper classes and no longer served the general interests of their community, as was the case in the previous social system. The upper layer lived in luxury as the people grew thinner under the weight of oppression and exploitation. All that was good and in abundance was placed at the feet of the king. These two layers were as far apart as earth and sky.

  

Of course the question arises as to why these societies were willing to accept feudalism. It does not make sense that they should just accept the new system brought in with Hinduism. On this issue, I cannot agree with the vast majority of historians who state that Hinduism entered Indonesia without any wars. Of course there were wars, given that this was a case of two opposing societies coming into contact. The earlier societies, where everybody worked for everybody, rejected the new system. They rebelled. Nevertheless, why then did the new system flourish? The new system triumphed and was able to dismantle the old system because the old system did not have the advantage of a concentration of force. They surrendered to a new system with all its overwhelming power. Or remnants of the older system fled and found a safe haven in some isolated area. However, wherever the new system triumphed, there emerged new kings. And the people had to swear their loyalty to these new rulers because the king was considered god on earth. With the entry of Hinduism, which created the feudal system, there emerged social differentiation between those engaged in crafts, in military affairs, and so on. Needs grew for a variety of materials. Trade of a kind began with other regions. This trade was still primitive and was not yet based on any strong tradition. Why?

  

Hs-y, you can imagine how almost everybody in the Indonesian agrarian society was a farmer and lived simply. In such a situation, trade could not flourish. Such a society could not produce a layer of people who made their livelihood from trade. This was very different from the caste society in India. In Indonesian agrarian society, the needs of the people were very simple, and so trade never grew beyond very stunted levels. You can still see this kind of primitive commerce today among Indonesian farmers. They take their produce into the towns to exchange for some basic needs such as salted fish, salt and some simple clothes. Then they do not come back for another three to six months. This kind of atmosphere does not encourage a strong tradition of trading.

  

Even so, every society is challenged by a change of era. Over a few centuries, Hinduism, supported by feudalism, planted deep roots throughout Indonesia. As the feudal civilisation reached higher levels, so, too, did its needs grow. Again, large social differentiation emerged. Every group in society had to have a productive function of its own. And the bourgeoisie emerged. There was a reasonable development of trade, although a strong and consolidated tradition had still not developed. History shows, in fact, Hs-y, that during this period there was a busy trade between the islands. Traders were travelling throughout Nusantara² in their sailing ships, some even travelling as far as China. According to the records of the Sung Dynasty in the ninth century, traders from Java and Sriwijaya [South Sumatra] went before the emperor and presented goods from Indonesia. We know, too, that at that time there were kingdoms in Indonesia that were hostile towards each other. These were Sriwijaya and Dharmawangsa in Java. These two kingdoms each wanted mastery over the seas because of the importance of trade in guaranteeing the prosperity of their kingdoms. It is no surprise that competition emerged among traders from the indigenous people themselves. Trade in Indonesia during this time became increasingly busy. Arabs, Indochinese, Filipinos and Chinese were all frequently visiting Indonesia. The trade had taken on an international character. We can see this, too, from reports from China that trading posts had been opened up in Canton and in other towns. It is not clear whether some of these trading posts were in Indonesia or in other Chinese towns. But we can still see that trade was already flourishing in Indonesia.

  

It was in this period that the rather primitive Indonesian trade first entered the international realm. I want to tell how this rather weak trading tradition entered the realm of international trade very quickly. We need to understand why we find no strong merchants developing in Indonesia.

  

Indonesian Trade Enters the Realm of International Trade

  

There are no historical records of how international trade first reached Indonesia. Archaeological remains indicate, however, that there was trading contact as early as the first century AD. But it flourished only a few centuries after Hinduism had planted feudalism in Indonesia. The second chapter in this story began when the outside world started to seek out the spices of Indonesia. Hs-y, it is truly amazing, almost unbelievable, that it would be these spices of Indonesia that would change the history of humankind.

  

But did this international trade in spices give rise overnight to large-scale spice merchants? Not at all. The process began very slowly in the beginning, sometimes growing big quickly if there was a particular order from one king or another. I do not think this is my area of expertise actually. This is something the scholars should work on. In any case, let me make an attempt.

  

Hs-y, though feudalism originally came from India, you must not think the situation in Indonesia was the same as that which prevailed in India at this time. To understand the state of feudal society in India and how it allowed for the development of a strong merchant class, it is worth quoting from Ramkrishna Mukerjee in his book The Rise and Fall of the East India Company:

  

... the Bhakti movement, probably led by the artisans and traders, was spreading over India. This movement, with its opposition to the caste system, was affecting the social and ideological stability of the village community system. And this was also the time when the Indian mercantile class was making itself felt in Indian society, and Royalty had also become interested in commercial pursuits, especially in foreign trade.

  

This stable Indian bourgeoisie then encountered wandering English traders, started to work together, and so did the colonisation begin. How strange human history is.

  

It was different or somewhat different in Indonesia. The kings could directly decree that the people gather together to produce. The officials who gathered this produce were in a position to give birth to a bourgeoisie. But the process was very slow because it was hard for them to get rid of their feudal mentality.

  

The foreign traders who came to Indonesia usually had to deal with the king, seeking an audience and presenting gifts. If these gifts were accepted, it was only then that barter might take place. In the book of Tung Hsi Yang K’au (published in 1618), according to Dr. Liem Twan Djie, there are some reports about ‘Ha-kang’ or ‘Hsia-chiang’, the Chinese term for Banten:

  

When the Chinese ship approached, an official would board the ship to seek an explanation. The captain of the junk would give a gift of a basket of Chinese oranges and two small umbrellas. The official would then present these to the king, and then when the ships entered the river they would present more fruits and silk to the king.

  

That was how trade was carried out: through the king. But why was it that the traders were willing to always deal through the king?

  

It may have been that the foreign traders hoped to obtain the goods more cheaply in this way. They would also feel safer from attack by pirates, with more protection. But is it true to say that these kings actually had some conscious policy of managing their economies? If they did have a conscious policy, why did they not protect and encourage the development of local merchants? This is not very clear to me. But the reality still is that trade flourished and became international. It had not, though, reached the levels it would during the period of the Dutch East Indies Company. The demand for spices had not yet found a definite form. All the reports indicate that it was in this period (960-1279) that there was stable trade between China and Indonesia.

  

Hs-y, I have talked a little above about how the still weak local merchants faced the much stronger international traders. There is no denying that there is always competition in commerce. In this fierce international competition, it is no surprise that the weaker Indonesian traders were marginalised. The reports from the Sung Dynasty show that most of the trade was carried out by Chinese traders in their junks and that there were only a few native Indonesian traders. Yes, just a few. And, in the end, the Chinese dominated the whole trade. The more Chinese traders arrived in Indonesia, the less reasons there were for local traders to travel abroad. In the end, they concentrated in the ports, becoming wholesalers to the foreign traders. But here, too, in the end, they lost their positions. The Chinese merchants stationed their own people in the ports to gather the goods they needed, thereby cutting out the middlemen and making the goods cheaper. So what happened to the local traders who had been gathering the produce up until then? Of course, again they came under great pressure and, in the end, they lost the initiative and returned to being ordinary people! This is one of the explanations as to why almost all trade is controlled by the Chinese, even up till today. What is the reason that the local traders lost out in the international competition? To understand this we need to look again at the nature of commerce in Indonesia in the preceding period. Let me try to explain.

  

The Marginalisation of Local Traders in International Trade

  

I have mentioned above that the Indonesian merchant class was different from that which developed in India during the Hindu period. Natural factors had not encouraged the development of a strong commercial tradition; almost all layers of society lived from farming.

  

And, Hs-y, there are other factors that I think are easy to understand. The Chinese traders and other traders from outside Indonesia had already developed a strong commercial tradition, and when they arrived, they faced a weak local trading class that had fallen behind the times. What was the reason? There was no other reason than that their perahu boats could not compete with the Chinese junks, which had a far greater cargo capacity. Shipbuilding techniques were far behind those of China. There was not yet a tradition of building large ships. Sailing was done in small boats. This was the reason for the defeat of the Indonesian Hindu feudalists, who did not keep up with the advances of the times. They were more at home sitting on their thrones and enjoying the comforts they obtained by squeezing the people, without thinking at all about their own trading world. So it is no surprise that there were many wars among these kings, each trying to gain control over ports where trade flourished, yielding rich tariffs from the foreign merchants. They fought these wars so that they could continue to enjoy their comforts without advancing their own trade. And what then was the fate of any local traders?

  

There is insufficient evidence to clarify whether there were any native traders at that time, people who lived solely from trade. Perhaps there were. But they would have been very small in number. There is no real clarity on this question. In the book Calon Arang, was written at the end of the Majapahit era, there is reference to a rich widow from the village of Girah. But it does not say whether she was a merchant or not. In the book Pranacitra, which tells of the period of Sultan Agung, there is mention of Pranacitra’s father, who was a merchant who traded as far away as Malacca, Aceh and Pahang. So there were those who participated in international trade. But then it is not clear whether Pranacitra’s father was a native or migrant to Indonesia. Pranacitra was described as somebody different from everybody else, more handsome and beautiful so that all the women fell madly in love with him. Unfortunately, we may have to take heed of some very annoying anthropological evidence. While there is little anthropological information available at this time, there are two reports that need noting. The report by the director Rempo Urip states that it was unusual to be chased by a beautiful Indonesian woman. And an AFP report from Singapore, reporting the views of two women who had been touring Asia, comments that Asian men are not driven by the same desire as European men to conquer women. Given that Pranacitra was described as extraordinarily beautiful and handsome and that he had extraordinary abilities in subduing women, I am forced to conclude that it is doubtful that he was a native inhabitant.

  

Even following these roundabout trails of evidence, we still cannot come to any real conclusions about the existence of a native trading class that derived its livelihood primarily from trade. There are scenes in Pranacitra that describe busy markets. But this is not enough to convince me that there were people whose livelihood was based solely on trading. This is important and interesting. The division between professionalism and amateurism in trading is also the division between having real skills and expertise and trading just as a sideline hobby. Our knowledge about this can help us answer the question: Why is it the Chinese who carry out almost all trade in all sectors in Indonesia?

  

I should stop here and apologise that I am unable to present any data from outside Java. Since the arrival of Hindu feudalism, Java has remained a feudal society, especially as regards its upper social layers. It was this concentration of power and strength that has meant that Java has left more historical evidence than the other islands. If we talk about the history of the region before the arrival of the East India Company, the history of Indonesia is essentially the history of Java. Perhaps in ten years time there will have been more research and more historical evidence discovered.

  

Hs-y, let us return to the question of whether there was a middle class deriving a livelihood from trade. I must conclude that even if there were such people, they did not occupy an influential or powerful position in this absolute feudal society. The reason is that the richness of the earth and nature meant that the population developed only minimal wants. They did not demand a level of commerce similar to that of countries where the conditions of nature and earth are poorer.

  

The Coming of Islam did not Change the Social System

  

The arrival of Islam in Indonesia, being brought by foreign traders and by very few Indonesians themselves, did not change the feudal structure of society. That continued. The reason was that those spreading the new religion did so by finding a compromise with Hindu feudalism. It would take up too much space to set out all the dates here that relate to this. In short, I ask you to recall the history of Islam during and since Majapahit. Those spreading the religion were given lands or territories to rule, becoming new feudalists themselves. Their descendants spread to other areas, with the area they controlled gradually becoming smaller. In the end, their positions were as landlords (see Babad Tanah Jawa). The Hindu feudal system remained in place throughout the period of the development of Islam and was even continued under the Dutch colonisation. Consciousness about this compromise and resistance to it only developed at the end of the last century and the beginning of this century. The place where the resistance began was Minangkabau, under the leadership of Hamka’s father.³

  

The Chinese filled a Gap in the Prevailing Social System

  

Nobody gave the Chinese the social position they now occupy. Certainly the Indonesian people did not give them their current position. The article by Hatta, saying that the Chinese were the primary helpers of the Dutch in commerce and government, is utter nonsense if we view the issue as being about the role of a whole group and not just that of individuals. If we look just at individual cases, there have been many Indonesians who have betrayed their nation. Can we use that fact to argue that the Indonesian people constitute a nation of traitors to their own country? This kind of equation is not just. In fact, it is completely off the mark. And it is an even more ridiculous line of thought that argues that the Chinese have obtained their current position as a result of services provided by Peking, as has been argued by that candidate Minister for Information whom I mentioned to you earlier.

  

Hs-y, the entry of Chinese trading goods into Indonesia during the Sung Dynasty (960-1279) marked the beginning of international trade reaching Indonesia. These goods were of great value (J.C. van Leur, Eenige beschouwingen betreffende den Ouden Aziatischen Handel). They included silk, brass goods, lacquer ware and copper (kuningan) goods, paper, medicines, sugar and expensive craft items. It was these goods that were exchanged for spices, timber and wooden products, gold, jewels, medicinal herbs and various exotic goods. As the trade in these goods grew or started to grow, there was indeed the need for an intermediary group. They were needed either as go-betweens, as people who gathered up the goods, or as people who immersed themselves in the commerce in these goods. So a question arises: Did the Indonesian people respond to historical developments represented by the emergence of real commercial life and give birth to an indigenous class of traders? Of course, it is only historical evidence that can answer this question. And what does historical evidence say? The picture is still not clear.

  

If this is all just about trade, then can that really explain how the Chinese obtained their social position and how they have been able to retain that position right up until today? This question answers the earlier question. When the historical challenge emerged and real commercial life started to grow, the Indonesian people did not hear the call of history; they did not respond. Since the very emergence of this commerce, it has been the Chinese who have taken the initiative.

  

Hs-y, there is another issue that must be clarified as regards the trading connection between China and Indonesia, namely, the sailing schedule between the two countries. This schedule very much depended on the season. The steam engine did not yet exist, so everything depended on the winds. As a result, there was time for business while people waited for the next chance to set sail. What was this time used for? For the feudalists, for lazing around of course. But the traders could not just waste their time like that. They used it to expand their commercial activities, seeking out new goods that had not received much attention beforehand, for speculation, and so on. But do not forget that there were adventurers who arrived here as well. They left their counties just because they did not like the situation or the atmosphere there. And sometimes it seemed so long for the winds to change to take them back to their countries!

  

Hs-y, sea communications at that time were very dependent on the winds – what van Leur referred to as ‘trade winds’. The winds changed direction every six months. The Chinese junks arrived in Java on December and had to wait until May before they could set sail for home. Among those waiting for May were those who engaged in speculation and lost all their capital. Perhaps there were those, too, who used the time to look around Java, fell in love with the country, and decided to reside here. There were, no doubt, those who became bound by love – not something difficult at all. And, as free persons, they would have been in a position to buy a slave, or two or three! And then they would multiply. All these things surely took place. And there certainly were those who decided to stay in Java specifically to help develop their business, opening trading posts, stabilising prices, and gathering and storing produce and other goods in demand. In those times, it was relatively easy to do this. There was no nationalism, no Immigration Service, although there were a customs service and a head tax on foreigners.

  

After the overthrow of the Sung Dynasty and the rise of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), Chinese trade with the world expanded rapidly. Of course, this was due to the rise in prosperity inside the country. Between 1405 and 1433 many expeditions were sent overseas. One of these went to Java and was led by a man called Cheng Ho.⁴ He was best known by the names Sam Po Kong or Sam Po Twa Lang among the Chinese on Java, and by the name Dampo Awang among the Javanese. (See also T.K.S., ‘Facts and Fancies About Sam Po Kong’, Djawa Post, 9 August 1958). Ma Huan, who had accompanied Cheng Ho in 1413, wrote a report about the countries they visited entitled Ying Yai Sheng Lan (Report on the Ocean’s Shores). From this report we discover that there were already many Chinese from Fukien and Canton in the port of Tuban. Tse-tsun, or Gresik, which began as a bare stretch of coast, was transformed by the Chinese into a prosperous commercial centre. And so many Chinese, with their different communities, moved there.

  

So, Hs-y, that is how the Chinese filled a gap left by the feudal social system, which valued only the service to the king as a means of livelihood. There was no PRC then, no East Indies Company, and no East Indies. That former candidate Minister for Information was not around either. Other centres of trade were Sunda Kelapa – Jakarta today – and Ha-kang (Hsia-chiang) or Banten.

  

Willem Lodewijcksz, a junior officer to Cornelis de Houtman, who dropped anchor in Banten on 23 June 1596, wrote about the Chinese:

  

The Chinese live in Bantam in quarters of their own in an area which is surrounded by a strong palisade and has a swamp to its left. They have the nicest houses there are in town. They are a subtle people who work very hard to make money and to put good food on the table...

  

This was quoted in a report published by G.P. Rouffaer and J.W. Ijzerman in their book De eerste Schipwaart der Nederlanders naar Oost-Indië onder C. de Houtman. According to this book, the Chinese lived in their own district behind a town wall. They traded at stalls alongside Portuguese, Arabs, Turks, Malays and Bengalis in the Banten market. There is no mention of local people. Perhaps because there were not yet any local people who lived from trade.

  

It is clear from these reports that the Chinese lived in the best houses even before Willem Lodewijcksz wrote his report. This fact underscores the weakness of the feudal social system in meeting the historical challenge of the time, in recognising there was a new factor in life, namely, international trade. This new situation required the emergence of a national middle class. Because there was no local initiative to meet this demand, a gap developed in the system that was naturally filled by foreigners who had long been traders, indeed, who, in fact, lived from trading. And since that time, trade fell into the hands of the Chinese. People complaining about the Chinese domination of trade are in fact complaining about the weaknesses of their own ancestors.

  

The Sudden Change with the Coming of the White Traders

  

The social position of the Chinese suddenly grew even stronger as international trade grew or, rather, as trade with Europe developed. The spices of Indonesia were changing the face of the earth. A new continent had been discovered because of those spices. And, in Indonesia, the trading fleets took on a military character, too, as the once normal trade in spices was transformed into a vicious, antagonistic, political and military struggle between the white nations. This struggle simply raised the price of spices, delivering more profits to the local spice wholesalers and merchants, namely the foreigners from China who had long been active in this sector. Hs-y, I say ‘the foreigners from China’ because it appears that other traders from Portugal, Goa, Bengal, Malaya and perhaps native traders were all defeated by the Chinese. Perhaps it is because of this that people now fault the Chinese! But at that time there was no guided economy. The feudalists, who controlled the economy, still took no interest in developing international trade, preferring to lazily take whatever wealth came to them. So trade then was very liberal and vicious too! There were no rules governing commerce. It was a battlefield that was often bloody.

  

The ships of the white traders brought many more goods, because their ships were much larger than the Chinese junks. The Chinese junks could not compete and were pushed aside. Slowly the junks disappeared from international trade. The oceans began to be dominated by the white traders. Trade between Indonesia and China was also dominated by the white traders. The Chinese traders who were residing in Indonesia had even less reason to travel back and forth. And the intense competition between the white traders also meant that their profits were going up healthily without them having to look for more trade. All this developed in accordance with historical necessity.

  

From all this, I refute the accusation that the Chinese obtained their social position because of white colonialism and imperialism. This is absolutely untrue and unproven. They had filled a gap created by the social system that existed even before the arrival of the East Indies Company. Besides that, there had never been any ban on native Indonesians becoming traders! Even today there is no ban on Indonesians entering commerce!

  

The Chinese also proved their toughness and superiority in trade after the arrival of the white trading armadas. The number of Chinese traders grew, while the other foreign traders faded away or just closed up shop.

  

The Chinese position also changed after the arrival of the white trading armadas. According to Dr. Liem Twan Djie, their position changed from being the intermediaries between merchants from China and local residents to being the intermediaries between the East Indies Company and local residents. Imports from Europe, India and Japan began to replace imports from China.

  

The Chinese junks were no longer visiting Indonesia when, in 1717, Governor General van Swol reduced the price of tea by one third. So by 1723, the Netherlands Indies government then had to issue a decree ordering the resumption of trade with China. This was carried out by Governor General Zwaerdecroon. Trade with China resumed and continued until the nineteenth century. However, it was never as important as in the earlier period. And, in the meantime, the Chinese residing in Indonesia were able to stabilise their position.

  

The Social Position of the Chinese was not a Gift from the Dutch

  

As part of the hate campaign against the Chinese, some people so readily make the accusation that the social position that the Chinese enjoy was a gift from the Dutch. Hatta has even written that they were the primary helpers of the Dutch in commerce and government. History can answer this despicable accusation.

  

Hs-y, perhaps you remember these words of Sun Yat-sen in his book San Min Chu I [Three Principles of the People]:

  

People generally become more quickly aware and rebel when they suffer political oppression, while they often develop no awareness at all when they are suffering only economic oppression.

  

The Netherlands Indies government implemented these two kinds of oppression against the Chinese as well as against the native inhabitants. The Indonesian people rebelled again and again when they became aware of the political oppression. This was not the situation with the Chinese. In their struggle to obtain a better social position, they were not able to avoid the political oppression of the Dutch. At the same time, they had almost no political rights and had developed only a shallow political consciousness. Nationalism developed in China only three centuries after the awakening in Europe. The Dutch oppression of the Chinese can be seen in a number of important events:

  

1. In 1740, Governor General Valckenier organised the slaughter of all the approximately 10,000 Chinese in Batavia.

  

2. An area on the west bank of the Citarum River was designated as the residential area for Chinese. The area was chosen because it was within Dutch cannon range.

  

3. In 1764, Governor General van der Parra banned the Chinese from living or trading in the Priangan area.

  

4. After the demise of the East Indies Company on December 31, 1799, the Batavian Republic (Bataafsche Republiek) confiscated much Chinese property. Any Chinese considered to have an unacceptable political attitude to the East Indies Company was targeted. Officials made the arbitrary decision as to what constituted an unacceptable attitude.

  

5. In 1804, Chinese and other non-Christians were banned from directly purchasing imported goods from Europe, America or Africa.

  

6. Pass Regulations, requiring all subjects to hold internal passports if they wished to move around, were used to extort money, in particular from the Chinese. Local rulers as well as officials carried out the extortion. These pass regulations also greatly hampered trading activities by restricting mobility. In this regard, I cannot help but remember Multatuli’s Saidja and Adinda, which tells of how Saidjah’s father was bankrupted because he could not pay for his pass! This weapon could kill the Chinese, as it did Saidjah’s father. The issuance of these passes was also made as difficult as possible.

  

7. In 1835 the Netherlands Indies government introduced residential regulations forcing the Chinese to live in specific areas. This policy was modelled on the ghetto example in Western Europe. In the regulations alone, perhaps, some people may not think that there was anything particularly unjust. But the reality was much different. For example, in the book Het Recht to wonen en reizen in Ned.-Indië by W. Brokx, which was also quoted by Dr. Liem Twan Djie, it is explained how officials used these regulations to seize the property of Chinese and to deprive them of their livelihood without any hearings or scope for any kind of negotiations. This was just an arbitrary exercise of power. It is true that in 1866, the regulation was relaxed so that Chinese were allowed to reside in other areas but not to trade there. And then, in 1879, their position as traders was further solidified when an Agrarian Law was promulgated banning them from becoming farmers.

  

Serious Impact from the Residential Regulations

  

The combined effect of the residential laws, the pass laws, and then the Agrarian Law was the extinction of the Chinese retail trade. The amazing thing was that the Indonesian people themselves did not begin such a tradition themselves at that time. There were no Netherlands Indies government regulations that constrained native Indonesians from becoming retail traders. What is the underlying reason that no indigenous retail traders emerged?

  

Currently, with PP 10 banning Chinese from trading in the villages, another opportunity is being created for indigenous Indonesians to become retailers in the villages. Will this challenge be taken up? A foreign professor in one of our universities has told his students, “If I were an Indonesian, I would go to a village and become a shopkeeper!” An August 1959 Antara report quoted the First Deputy Chairperson of the East Java Commerce and Enterprise Association as urging all youths who were unable to further their studies to choose to work in the village retail sector. He said that this sector promised much better prospects than working as a clerk or a similar position in an office. And what has been the response to these calls? Dead silence.

  

Hs-y, we know that these policies of the Netherlands Indies government were motivated by the idea that they would win sympathy from the Indonesian people, who would feel protected from Chinese exploitation. I say ‘exploitation’ because this is the term used in the hate campaigns now. It is a term that was used by the colonial authorities but not at all by the people themselves. This is the motive that has been put forward by the colonial rulers, both white-skinned and brown, since then until today. This was a policy to redirect hatred away from colonialism and imperialism towards another defenceless target, namely, the Chinese.

  

The residential regulations separated the Chinese from the Indonesian people, making it more difficult for assimilation and integration. They negated those Chinese who had already become Indonesians. This was a policy to create disunity and differences among the people, especially given that there had not yet been any emergence of nationalism. This was part of a long-term strategy to create contradictions in the future, not only as an obstacle to the development of a healthy nationalism, but also in order to set different sections of society against each other, to fight each other. This was all meant to prevent nationalism, which inevitably would emerge to bury Dutch colonialism and imperialism. The social contradictions created by this population policy would, to some extent or other, help the Dutch deal with any emerging nationalism in the future.

  

The concentration of the Chinese in particular areas was also designed to make it easier for the Dutch to keep surveillance over them and to carry out any acts of extermination, as they had done in 1740. This could be done directly or by provoking popular sentiments by slandering the Chinese, especially if religion were used. Perhaps there will be those who deny that the Dutch would think like that. But then we must remember that after the 1740 massacre, the Chinese were forced to move to the western bank of the Ciliwung River where they were specifically within Dutch cannon range! And then we saw in my earlier letter how the Dutch systematically worked to cultivate anti-Chinese feelings.

  

Besides all this, the Agrarian Law, which appeared to be there to protect the people, offered no protection at all. The people still endured all kinds of forced labour. The law was instituted more to ensure the separation of the two peoples so that both could be exploited without causing them to unite. This law was issued when the Dutch were fighting the Acehnese and did not want to see another front open up against them. The Chinese traders were also causing problems for the Dutch army in Aceh. They had been able to get goods through the Dutch blockade and were, no doubt, also providing weapons to the Acehnese patriots.

  

The separation instituted through the residential – or ghetto – regulations was a new element in Chinese-Indonesian relations. First, the Dutch did succeed in creating this separation. Second, the Chinese began to exist in a permanent state of fear, fearing threats that could come from outside their ghetto, whether from the Dutch or from the people if they had been stirred up. And that danger could at any time become a reality. They had to create a community of their own, creating a group mentality and identity and a sense of group solidarity. The mentality and character created by these specific circumstances among the Chinese in Indonesia would make them different from the Chinese in mainland China, especially with the people in the PRC. This specific situation would leave a deep and determining mark even until today.

  

There is another aspect of the Agrarian Law that you should be aware of, Hs-y. Slowly but surely the Chinese small farmers, tied to farming by their love for the land, were forced to marry Indonesian women; if they wanted to be able to continue to farm their land, they had to do so under the [Indonesian] names of their wives. This has produced a new complication. Season after season, these Chinese small farmers have spread their descendants to every corner of the land, up into the mountains, and to the most isolated villages. It became a necessity for the majority of the Chinese, namely small farmers, to take an Indonesian wife. I say ‘the majority’ because in the beginning, most Chinese were not traders or shopkeepers.

  

R. A. Kartini⁵: The Biggest Criminals are the Capitalist-Imperialists

  

The spread of racial, political, social and economic discrimination in the eighteenth century was an international phenomenon with its roots in imperialism, colonialism, and especially capitalism. Human history is now marked by shameful humiliations because of this. New, excessively national sentiments and various forms of chauvinism (each instance of chauvinism backed by its own philosophical justification) have emerged. But this history has also given rise to challenges, including from within capitalism, imperialism and colonialism. The Renaissance and the Enlightenment are proof that humanity must return to itself and not be bound by various dubious myths. At the end of the nineteenth century, when Indonesia was still living under the law of the jungle, there appeared Kartini – an incomparable jewel in Indonesian history. There has never been another like her in Indonesian history or in the world. This extraordinary woman, who had been able to develop her understanding to the extent that she became the first socialist in Indonesia, relentlessly attacked all myths. That Kartini is still seen only as a pioneer of the emancipation of women is a result of lazy research. Kartini is also the mother of the national movement, of the Indonesian national awakening. Her social and political views were not only critical and sharp but also human in accordance with the character of the Indonesian people through the ages.

  

People who know Kartini only as an advocate for women may laugh at me for exaggerating her role. Perhaps they will attack me for connecting her with politics.

  

In order that people are not misled on this, I would like to explain what readings became the basis for the social and political outlook of Kartini.

  

First of all, she read Multatuli, the Dutch writer, who so valiantly fought for the rights of de Javaan [the Javanese], including Kartini herself, and who also fought valiantly against the evils of colonialism, imperialism and their agents. Then she also read the American woman writer Beecher Stowe, whose book Uncle Tom’s Cabin was written in defence of the American Negro. She became one of the forces behind the Civil War, the United States Revolution that ended negro slavery. (See also R. Nieuwenhuys, ‘Kartini’s Vorming’, Nieuwsgier, 24 April 1952). Also influencing her social and political views were the writings of F. August Bebel, a leader of German social democracy and the author of Die Frau und der Sozialismus, or Women and Socialism. She also read Bertha von Suttner, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1905, who wrote the world famous book Die Waffen Nieder and the Jewish writer Israel Zangwill, who wrote about life in the ghettos of East London, including Dreamers of the Ghetto. Of course Kartini read all these in Dutch translations.

  

So, as a socialist, she was among the most advanced of individuals at that time. Dark power was running amok on most continents, and, as one of the first Indonesian women, she stood straight and firm and rejected and gave no solace to the barbaric law of the jungle that was spreading. Among the letters that Kartini received were some unpublished letters that point to her socialist outlook. One responded to an inquiry Kartini had made by writing, “It is a great pity, but Marx has not yet been translated into Dutch! You will have to wait!” Kartini died without reading Marx.

  

Hs-y, why I am mentioning Kartini here? Because while she was alive, she always refused to be drawn into the hate campaigns against the Chinese, that trap set by the capitalist-colonialist-imperialist powers. Rather, she courageously defied these powers. In one of her articles in De Hollaandsche Lelie, published in the centre of colonialism and imperialism, she spoke nobly:

  

I am in great sympathy with the goals of the socialists, and I think it would be only too correct if, at meetings to form police detachments, it should be announced that the real criminals are not to be found in the villages, but in the Heeren and Keizersgracht...

  

The Heeren and Keizersgracht are where Holland’s big capitalists lived!

  

But it seems that many of our politicians, not to mention the press, do not possess the nobility of mind that Kartini had and do not have the social outlook that can place issues in their own country and in their correct context. Too many of them are so backward compared to Kartini, a young woman who died young, who had no political party to support her, and with no band of supporters. But she will always stand at the head of Indonesian history. She never viewed the Chinese as the source of the poverty of the Indonesian people. She identified another source: imperialism-colonialism-capitalism. This is still the issue today. The poverty endured by the Indonesian people today, with or without PP 10, is still the result of imperialism-colonialism-capitalism. As in Kartini’s day, this power still remains based outside Indonesia but with its tentacles throughout Indonesia.

  

It is a shameful fact that among the eight parliamentary factions that are supporting PP 10 are the three major parties, the PNI⁶, Masyumi⁷, and NU⁸. They are supporting and defending the attempts of the government to end the retail shop activity of foreigners and shift it all into the hands of the Indonesians. But history will continue its march. What is right and what is wrong will be revealed by history. But in the meantime, let us not bury humanity! Because humankind without humanity is no longer human!

  

Chinese Hunters: Surround the Chinks even more Tightly!

  

The Dutch, in their efforts to direct popular anger away from themselves, channelled these feelings to a group that did not at all deserve to be targeted: the Chinese. The Dutch acted as Chinese hunters who pursued the Chinese wherever they went, crying out: Blood-suckers! Rent-eaters! Smugglers! Counterfeiters! Bribe-givers! Money-lovers! Greedy! Antisocial! These labels would have been better applied to the Dutch themselves. The Dutch were the real criminals. And the social system, which was the basis of the colonisation of Indonesia and has continued until today, allows for any person to be exploited by another so long as the police do not arrest you or are able to arrest you. Under such a system as this, there was no way any group could have been given a privileged social position as a gift from the Dutch, although it was quite within the power of the Dutch to grant such a privilege to an individual. Under this system, it is not just social position but everything – one’s rights and property – indeed everything that has to be fought for, defended, or seized from somebody else. And any group that cannot throw itself fully into this liberal battlefield may fall apart as a group, may lose its rights and property, and perhaps its members may even lose their lives. Everybody has to look out for their own skin, their own flesh and blood. It was this situation in society then – and now – which we all find ourselves in, we residents of Indonesia, indigenous citizens, descendants of foreigners, both passive and active holders of foreign citizenship, and foreigners in Indonesia. That is why the best answer to such a situation is none other than a guided democracy, a guided economy, in short, guided development.

  

Looking again at the situation of the Chinese, it is indeed possible to see how resilient they were in defending their rights, property, skin, and flesh and blood in the midst of Dutch colonial oppression and in their social relations. We can see, too, how they related to the Indonesian people, who sometimes were also successfully provoked into anti-Chinese activity.

  

In the 1901 crown speech, a new ethical policy⁹ was announced. New political changes began, which made the position of the Chinese even worse. According to Phoa Liong Gie in his book De Economische Positie der Chineezen in Nederl.-Indie, the new political direction virtually made the Chinese the official Public Enemy Number One. As stated in the report by P.H. Fromberg, the Chinese were, or were considered, the main obstacle to the economic advancement of the natives. He went on to say that the Chinese were not motivated by the same Christian civilisation and morality as European business people. In order to protect the native population, he said, there should be severe regulations that would limit the Chinese from spreading into the villages. The ethical policy, aimed at protecting the indigenous people, was such a thing of beauty! Beautiful on the surface, but underneath the intent was only more exploitation, and direct exploitation at that. Because the Dutch themselves had been unable to insert themselves as the go-between merchants of society, they then tried to excite the people against the Chinese. But, in a liberal social system, it is struggle itself that determines whether a group will survive or prosper. Does such a group have the characteristics necessary to win a particular battle or not? And, in the case of becoming the merchant middlemen of Indonesia, the Dutch just did not have what it takes; neither did any other foreign group. From among the indigenous people, only very few succeeded, even until today.

  

Hs-y, the consequences of the ethical policy of the Dutch did not end there. On top of this was a whole range of individual oppressions that the Chinese suffered. The officials that inflicted oppression on individual Chinese felt no guilt in what they were doing. They felt they were being of service to the people by protecting the economic life of the native people. This was how it was reported by P.H. Fromberg in his article ‘De Chineesche Beweging op Java’ (‘The Chinese Movement in Java’).

  

Van Gulik, in Winkler Prins’ Alg. Encyclopedië, also said that the situation of the Chinese at the end of the nineteenth century was very unhappy. On the one hand, the Dutch positioned them as equal with the native population. But then, as a result of the ethical policy politics, the Chinese were made targets, as if they were an obstacle to the new policy. And the more the colonial government pretended to help the native people, the more the Chinese had to endure various oppressions. All fingers pointed at them accusingly: You suck the blood of the people!

  

In this regard, P.H. Fromberg reminded people:

  

Of course there were scabby sheep amongst the Chinese merchants ... but one must not make the mistake of calling things specifically ‘Chinese’ while these things happen in every society when circumstances are the same, and there was so often this phenomenon that all the Chinese in the Indies were seen as responsible for the misconduct of a few; one lumped them all together.

  

Fromberg’s words had little impact. The white press joined in spreading the hate campaign: Hem in the Chinks even more tightly! The Chinese had no political rights and no means of defending themselves. They faced an absolute power. The Chinese hunters banged their drums, gongs, and everything else they could get their hands on, and blew their trumpets and whistles, while the Chinese were the chickens being hunted down without mercy. Nor did the Dutch government offer any education to the Chinese, whom they said had no Christian culture or morality. So the Chinese had to rely upon themselves in this situation and began to teach traditional Chinese culture to their people. (See also Tio Ie Soei, Lie Kim Hok).

  

In addition to all this, the government also banned Chinese from holding any position of employment with the government, from the lowest to the highest position. In dealings with the police, the Chinese experienced detention in greater numbers, more frequently and for longer periods than any other group.

  

And this was not all. Their formal position was the same as that of the local people, yet they were treated as if they were the enemy of this colonised people. They endured social and economic oppression devoid of any protection under the law and without any social facilities such as education, schools or cultural support, yet they were forced to pay more taxes than Europeans.

  

The oppression of the Chinese, and Orientals generally, is best seen in a regulation issued by the colonial government in the town of Semarang. The Chinese were banned from walking across the city square on pain of paying a fine if they were caught in violation. What is the secret behind this regulation, Hs-y? Try to guess!

  

As their educational and cultural activities developed, they became more aware of what their position in colonial society really was. They began to understand they were not protected by any laws at all. So from this we can understand why, at the beginning of the twentieth century, they began to turn to their country of origin, which itself was then also struggling to enter the modern epoch in its own history. They turned their backs on colonisation, and they took no notice, either, of the Indonesian people, who indeed could do nothing for them in the context of friendship between peoples. Nor could the Chinese do anything for the Indonesian people. This situation was also well described by Fromberg:

  

The Chinese in the Netherlands Indies, according to the press, are stepchildren whom the Netherlands Indies government refuses to acknowledge but who have been rediscovered by their own father (China), who has been asleep all this while but who is finally awakening.

  

The article by Haji Rosihan Anwar in Pedoman, 20 January 1960, ‘Extraordinary Stamina and Vitality’, is very misleading on this issue:

  

There was a time when Indonesian-born Chinese women did many of the same things as local people. They wore Javanese clothes, chewed betel, and so on. But in 1903 K’ang Yu-wei arrived in Java and taught nationalism and reform among the Chinese. He urged them to set up their own schools. So a trend that was heading in the direction of assimilation of Chinese with Indonesians was thereby brought to an end.

  

Two Chinese warships visited Jakarta, Semarang and Surabaya, in 1907, 1909 and 1911. An Indonesian-born Chinese journalist later wrote that when the Chinese community saw the officers and men from these ships, there grew a new warmth of feeling towards the land of their ancestors among the Chinese of Southeast Asia (Boekoe Peringatan 1907-1937 Tiong Hwa Siang Hwee, Semarang, 1937).

  

Hs-y, I say ‘misleading’ because Anwar did not explain the social background of the Chinese situation in relation to van Deventer’s ethical policy, which was carried out so arrogantly and clumsily by the officials of the Netherlands Indies government. Of course, it is quite possible that the arrival of these warships brought about a new feeling of warmth among the Chinese of the South Seas towards their homeland. But none of this could have happened overnight without there being some process that caused things to develop in that direction. The incomplete characterisation of Haji Rosihan Anwar’s reportage feels like it is keeping certain facts separate from the broader and more central issues.

  

This misleading analysis becomes even more obvious when we also take into account his other comments or personal fantasies:

  

And now the situation today is one where the PRC is emerging as a strong and powerful country. We can imagine how strong a hold this country must have on the feelings of the Chinese here so that they will do anything that is demanded by Peking’s politics.

  

The honourable Haji should present hard evidence and facts and not just report his own fantasies; otherwise, he would be better off writing short stories! In any case, he appears now as one more Chinese hunter banging his drum. In other words, through the publication of his fantasy, he has joined the chorus: Hem in the Chinks even tighter!

  

Eventually the Netherlands Indies government realised that it had made a mistake in its policy towards the Chinese. They did not want the Chinese to turn towards the country of their ancestors but to Amsterdam. So the colonisers quickly set about correcting their mistake. Finally, in 1908, they established a kind of Hollandsch-Chineesche School, and, in 1910, the pass regulations were repealed. Two years after that, the ghetto regulations were repealed. Since then, the Chinese have experienced their own path of development which continues right up until today, but with a new element in the picture: Dutch or Western education.

  

Then and Now

  

Hs-y, I have no choice but to recognise the historical record and therefore, say that the social position of the Chinese was neither a gift from the Dutch nor something given by the Indonesian people. It is the result of a long and complicated social struggle that has taken many victims. That their position was a gift from the Dutch is a total myth, indeed, a modern fabrication that is being exploited by certain people. A laughable superstition, no matter how modern. And, as I have said, Kartini, the mother of Indonesia, had a much more human, a much more understanding and farsighted view on all this than the majority of our politicians in parliament, as reflected in the number of parliamentary factions that have supported PP 10 (PIA, 30 December 1959).

  

The Chinese issue has developed as the result of a long socio-historical process. In order to understand this process, one must seek out the historical evidence. There must not be any arbitrary and unacceptable actions against the Chinese, either individually or collectively. I would oppose such actions against any group among the Indonesian people, an independent people to be respected who can be respected because, indeed, their behaviour is worthy of respect.

  

I cannot defend anybody here in Indonesia who now mimics the Dutch attitude towards the Chinese or towards any other group in society. Because there were no Jews in Indonesian society, the Dutch placed the Chinese in a similar position to that which the Jews had suffered, always being harassed and humiliated so as to satisfy the sense of Dutch racial superiority. Hs-y, if there is any development in Indonesian history which brings down shame, it is what is happening now, when some Indonesians are copying the Dutch example by becoming Chinese hunters, backed by their press and showing no humanity.

  

What has been launched now against the Chinese was launched in an earlier time by the Dutch. What the Dutch never were able to do, and what is not being done now either, is to create a society without social enclaves, a society where every individual feels he has a place, where all have the same rights and responsibilities, namely, socialism.

  

Endnotes

⁵ Kartini (1879-1905) was the daughter of a Javanese regent. She established the first native-run school for girls, and her letters, published posthumously, won recognition as being very enlightened and progressive on the situation of women, especially in the criticism of polygamy and child marriage. Kartini is one of the first Javanese writers sympathetic to socialist ideas.

  

⁶ The PNI (Indonesian National Party) was a secular nationalist party that had left and right wings. At the time of writing, the right wing was dominant; by 1964, the left wing had become the majority. With the exception of the left-wing of the PNI, all the parties were opposed to the PKI and the leftwards orientation of Soekarno after 1959.

  

⁷ Masyumi was a conservative, right-wing party whose leadership was drawn from the middle-class trading families of the urban centres.

  

⁸ The NU (Nahdatul Ulama) was a conservative, right-wing Islamic party, whose leadership was drawn from the rural middle-class, including religious teachers and land-owners. The NU propagated a less Middle Eastern form of Islam, retaining more local Javanese beliefs.

  

⁹ The Ethical Policy, which spoke of the Netherlands’s moral duty to the people of the Indies, introduced further government involvement in economic and social affairs. While this included improvements to education, health care, and especially irrigation, most of these changes were aimed at meeting the needs of Dutch capital in Indonesia rather than genuinely advancing Indonesian society. In any case, these expenditures ended with the Great Depression. The lawyer and politician Van Deventer was one of its main supporters. 

## Letter Five

  

## The Chinese can be Friends in Struggle

  

Hs-y,

  

Perhaps you have read the letter from Foreign Minister Dr. Subandrio to the PRC Foreign Minister Chen Yi, dated 9 December 1959. The letter comprises several numbered points, so it is easy to isolate point number 14, which I think is one-sided and misleading:

  

It is necessary to be aware of the suppressed feelings within Indonesian society towards the Chinese, in order to be able to properly evaluate the patience and self-restraint of the Indonesian side in its policies towards the Chinese.

  

The seeds of anti-Chinese sentiments have been in existence since the Dutch times and also during the Japanese occupation.

  

And since then there has been the problem of the behaviour of the Chinese after Independence.

  

There are several examples. There was the Poh An Tui, an organisation armed by the Dutch that became a tool of the Dutch in resisting the struggle for Indonesian independence. There was the joy shown by some Chinese when the Dutch returned after the Japanese occupation. There is a lot of evidence to show that it is the Indonesian people who must suppress their feelings in order to establish friendly relations with the Chinese.

  

Hs-y, here is an official letter wherein the actions of individuals are treated as the actions of a whole group. Fromber had already reminded people that, yes, there are bad apples among the Chinese. But do not generalise by saying that all Chinese must be held responsible for the actions of a few individuals. Furthermore, Subandrio also misuses these cases of individual actions! The reason why the Indonesian people have never taken revenge against the Chinese is because they never have felt any need for revenge against them. The Indonesian people have never sought revenge against a foreign people that has not been their enemy. Those who have sought revenge against the Chinese are the bourgeoisie, their rivals in commerce. And that the Chinese are measured by the actions of the Poh An Tui and by how the Dutch return was greeted by some of them is also very unhealthy. In fact, I would rather say that such a way of measuring the Chinese is sick! Why? Because there is even a former cabinet minister who actually took the initiative to busy himself by forming a welcoming committee in Jakarta for the Allies after the Japanese occupation.

  

Of course, he was the laughing stock of his friends. But this action by this former minister surely could not be used to measure the whole of the Indonesian people and to conclude that they were all ready to welcome the Allied army?

  

In fact, the Chinese can be friends in the struggle of the Indonesian nation. They have already often proved that this is possible, before, during, and since the revolution. And I will try to prove this to you in this fifth letter.

  

Before Dutch Colonisation

  

I do not know a lot about relations between the [Indonesian] people and the Chinese in this period. I have almost no sources about their contribution to struggle, or perhaps there are none. But then the question is: Struggle against what? There are few historical materials about the occasional and sporadic foreign invasions that took place. And the whole concept of government then would have been so different from today, with the Republic of Indonesia and its clear territorial boundaries.

  

From the almost non-existent evidence I do have, I can still tell of how they helped develop the barren coast of Gresik onto a prosperous international trading port. It would have been better if I could have related this in a section entitled “The Chinese Contribution to Indonesian Progress”.

  

But, anyway, seeing that there is a vacuum of information about the pre-colonial period, let me use Gresik to fill the space.

  

Knowledge of Gresik’s development became available at the time of the arrival of Islam in East Java. According to Dr. B. Schrieke in his book Boek van Bonang, it was reported that Gresik, with Jaratan as its harbour, was bigger than Tuban. It was a prosperous town, full of goods and all kinds of foodstuffs. In 1523, there were twenty-three thousand residents of the Islamic faith. If we add the Chinese and other foreign residents, then there must have been at least double that figure in total, including those who were not Muslims.

  

Tuban, the harbour town of Erlangga’s¹ kingdom after his victory in 1037, also grew into a large commercial centre because of its intimate contact with the Chinese, who had established a colony there for trading purposes. As a sign of gratitude to the city, Erlangga gave special trading privileges to Tuban, or Tapan as the Chinese pronounced it.

  

The development of international trade during this period cannot be separated from the contributions of the Chinese. This is also true as regards the development of another town under Erlangga, namely, Ujung Galuh, located at the mouth of the Brantas.

  

Hs-y, this is the little I know about their contributions during this period, which has been reported by history. But historical research in the future will surely bring forth more evidence.

  

The Colonial Period

  

There can be no doubt that the Chinese made very recognisable contributions during the colonial period, but I must also note that there were those who did damage. For example, there was Sacanegara, a Chinese who conspired with Queen Syarifah from Banten, herself of Arab descent, to work with the Dutch so as to dominate Banten (Memorie van Overdracht van de Resident Gollenese, 1753). But do not think there were no Chinese among the fighters for independence. In some ways it is difficult to research them because so many Chinese of that time had assimilated, adopting not only local names but also local customs and traditions.

  

In his work Fakta yang Dilupakan (Facts Banished from Memory), E.H. Bahruddin wrote that many Chinese became spies for Indonesians, being able to take advantage of their position as merchants with many connections:

  

So Sultan Agung used a Chinese to spy on the Dutch positions at Pasar Ikan. The Chinese concerned, called Jonge-ling by the Dutch (maybe his name was Tjong Ling or Lin), was caught and later hanged after being tortured. Because there were these Chinese who were one with the Indonesian people, it is no wonder that the East Indies Company were suspicious of them. They gathered the Chinese together and formed the Chinese Wijken, or Chinese hamlets. In Jakarta, Glodok and Bidaracina still remind us of that era. The village Pintu Kecil was originally a market outside the East Indies Company fort where Chinese were permitted to trade but not to live. Tangerang was another place set aside for them. This was also the site of an East Indies Company fort. There was a curfew after maghrib [sunset] prayers, and they were not allowed to go out again at night.

  

In the rebellion led by Pieter Eberfeld, there were an Indonesian and a Chinese. Both were sentenced to death based on false accusations. The 1740 massacre was justified by the Dutch with the argument that the Chinese were preparing to join with the Indonesian people in an attempt to overthrow Dutch rule. Whether this was true or not, the important thing is that the Dutch considered the Chinese enemies and not allies, and so they were friends in the struggle of the Indonesian people.

  

The Chinese also made contributions in the resistance against Dutch colonialism and imperialism, although the contributions have sometimes been considered to be too little. After the 1740 massacre, thousands of Chinese surrounded Batavia and launched attack after attack on the fort. The Chinese also attacked the town of Rembang in the same year and killed all the Europeans. The Chinese uprising inspired Sunan [Lord] Pakubuwono to resume his fight to expel the Dutch. When the Chinese surrounded the fort at Kartasura and it was unable to receive food from outside, the Sunan did nothing. In the end the Dutch forces had to surrender in July 1741. The commander and officers were all killed. The enlisted men were offered the choice of being killed or becoming Muslims. Many of them agreed to be circumcised.

  

And so the Chinese military struggle against the Dutch, now working in cooperation with the indigenous people, spread to Jepara and Gresik.

  

Sunan Pakubuwono then realised that the East Indies Company army was able to hit back at the Chinese all over Java, that only the Dutch could keep him on his throne, and that even Tjakraningrat (from Madura) had started to attack the Chinese forces and to make attacks into Central Java. So Pakubuwono surrendered to the Dutch and sought forgiveness for his sins. But an official, Noto Kusomo, who had led the native forces allied to the Chinese, refused to give up the fight. Rather, they made Mas Gerendi, the grandson of Sunan Mas, the new Sunan Mangkurat V. Together with the Chinese, Mas Gerendi attacked the palace at Kartasura. Von Hohendroff was only able to save Pakubuwono from the burning palace with much difficulty. He was taken to Semarang. Then, in 1742, Tjakraningrat suddenly invaded from Madura, and the close alliance between the indigenous peoples and Chinese in the fight against Dutch imperialism died out.

  

A similar thing happened in the middle of the eighteenth century in Banten. Queen Syarifah of Banten, who was of Arab descent, had great influence over the Sultan. In an act of treason against the kingdom and the people, she suddenly surrendered all of her economic powers to the East Indies Company. In 1753, some of the nobles who were not recognised by the Sultanate, along with various escaped slaves, launched a great revolt against Queen Syarifah. According to E.H. Bahruddin:

  

The rebellion was led by Ki Tapa and lasted three years. Sie Ban Lie, the owner of a food stall on the Tangerang highway, led the Chinese who joined the rebellion. This was reported by the Dutch Resident at the time, van Gollenese. Sie Ban Lie’s son-in-law owned an orchard in Bogor and a weaving mill. It was he who hid Ki Tapa and Mas Dullah in his mill. Ki Tapa, with the aid of the peasant leader Mas Dullah, attacked and cleared out Tangerang altogether, making their way right into Jakarta, to the area now known as Kramat Senen.

  

If the officers and soldiers of Surapati had had the habit of providing written reports, we would know exactly how many Chinese joined him in his struggle against the Dutch.

  

There are also other scattered data that indicate clearly their resistance against the Dutch invaders. In the Java War of 1825-1830, the Chinese in West Kalimantan indirectly helped with the war effort. Most of the Chinese there were gold miners, living in Mandor, Montrado, Lara and Lumar, and were mainly Teochew and Hakka Chinese. They had taken a hostile stance towards the Dutch since the eighteenth century. They refused to pay all taxes to the Dutch and also refused to pay duty on salt and opium. Governor General Van der Capellan waged constant war against them. After every military action against them, they appeared to become docile. As soon as the military forces withdrew, they would begin resisting again. In July 1825, the Dutch were forced to send 600 soldiers to Pontianak to crush their resistance. The Java War delayed the completion of this plan. It was only in 1854 that the Chinese resistance was broken. Their resistance during this period helped the Padri and Java Wars as well as the rebellions in Banten and Palembang and the wars in Bali (1846, 1848 and 1849).

  

Neither should we forget the role of the Chinese temples in Jakarta during the period of British rule, when they became centres for the spread of rumours and reports undermining the authority of Raffles.²

  

In the Java War, the Chinese provided concrete support in the form of armed units as well as assistance with equipment. At the same time, there were those Chinese who assisted the Dutch (tax and tariff collectors at bridges), who were destroyed by Diponegoro³ (July 1825). And then, in November 1827, there was a sudden uprising against the Dutch in Rembang, led by Tumenggung Sosrodilogo. The Dutch saw it as a very dangerous rebellion with the potential to spread south, to Madiun and Kediri. Sosrodilogo wiped out Resident Nahuys and the native contingent he had mobilised from Solo. The same fate befell Lt. De Sturler. Sosrodilogo was able to occupy Blora and almost reached Tuban. On 26 January 1828, the Dutch had to send General G.J. Holsman to suppress the rebellion. In a battle at Rajegwesi, to the south of Bojonegoro, Sosrodilogo suffered a defeat from which he was unable to recover.

  

But how was this sudden uprising able to spread so quickly and seize control over such a sizeable area in just two months? It was possible because they had weapons, rifles. And where did they come from? Hs-y, a few kilometres to the east of Rembang was a Chinese colony called Lasem, an old port. It was from here that the weapons came, smuggled, of course, from Singapore by the Chinese. I draw this conclusion because the Acehnese ambassadors had the same experience when they were fighting their Dutch colonial wars.

  

In the struggle for independence, we can also find different examples of how the Chinese sincerely and honestly supported the Indonesian people, as well as cases of their resolve to liberate themselves from the discriminatory regulations and policies that they suffered. During the Dutch period, a political association was formed, the Chinese-Indonesian Union (Persatuan Indonesia-Tionghoa – PIT). Among its activities was support for the Sutardjo Petition, which demanded a parliament for Indonesia. In the Netherlands, the Chinese were active and supported the Indonesian Association established by Dr. M. Hatta and Mr. Abdulmadjid. This was also because the Indonesian Association viewed the Indonesian nation broadly to include Indo-Europeans, Indo-Chinese and all those who felt themselves to be natives of the country.

  

In my third letter to you I mentioned how Colonel Amir Mahmud, the Martial Law Commander for Bandung, equated Liem Koen Hian with Douwes Dekker. I should perhaps explain to you that Liem Koen Hian was the editor of the Sin Tit Po daily after World War II. (He died in 1952, without many people knowing).

  

In both the struggle for independence and in the struggle to raise the standard of living of the people, there is another name, one belonging to a twenty year old youth, whom we should not forget. He was somebody who always took a stand and thought and acted so energetically. In the middle of 1924, as a result of his efforts, the Indies Seamen’s Employees Union (Sarekat Pegawei Laoet India – SPLI) was formed. It was an affiliate of the International Workers Union (Sarekat Sekerja Internasional). Semaun himself became the Chairperson and Soemantri, the Secretary. The SPLI was divided into two sections: the Western section, which looked after Indonesians working on the European routes, and the Eastern section, which organised Indonesian sailors working on Asian routes.

  

On Java itself, there were the Warehouse and Sea Union (Sarekat Laoet dan Goedang) in Semarang and the Harbour Workers Union (Sarekat Kaoem Boeroeh Pelaboehan) in Jakarta and Surabaya. These two organisations fused together to become the Sea and Warehouse Employees Union (Sarekat Pegawei Pelaboehan dan Laoetan). This union was headed by R.M. Gondohojoewono, Tan Ping Tjiat and Sundah. This organisation, in turn, joined with Semaun’s SPLI. The Chinese had a role, important or not so important, in all the trade unions, for example, in the Sugar Workers Union (Sarekat Boeroeh Goela), which was also founded in 1924.

  

In the trade union-led rebellions of 1925, the Chinese also played a role, as happened in Ngawi. In both the 1925 strikes and the worker mass meetings in Surabaya on 21 December 1924, it was not only the Chinese workers who played a role, but also the press, then called the Malay-Chinese press.

  

We cannot forget their contributions to the trade union movement, such as through the SR, VSTP, the International Typesetters Union, the Mechanics Union, the Electrical Workers Union and the Marine Workers Union. And neither can we forget the contribution of the workers in the printing offices who printed and distributed pamphlets that attacked the Dutch colonialists.

  

There were also Chinese involved in the transport strike at the Semarangsch Stoomboot-en Prauwenveer, which brought to a halt the work of a thousand workers, both captains and crew. The same was true for a number of other strikes that brought to a standstill some of the big capitalist-colonialist Dutch, British and American companies. These included the two-month strike at a big printing plant in Surabaya, the strike at the machine factories at N.I. Industrie, as well as one at the Braat plant in Surabaya. There were also strikes at Du Croo Brauns, Dapuan and Polygram organised by the Electrical Workers Union, which involved 2,500 people in Surabaya at the end of 1925. While I cannot give figures for Chinese involvement in the struggle for independence and in the struggle for social improvement, there can be no doubt of their participation.

  

During the Japanese Occupation

  

Neither can it be said that the Chinese as a group helped their elder siblings. Indeed, the first thing the Japanese did when they set foot on Indonesian soil was to attack the Chinese shops. At that time, they were still at war with the Kuomintang, and that struggle reached Indonesia as well. I still remember Chiang Kai-shek in 1948 saying that one nation can only be defeated by another nation if it assists its enemy.

  

It is a pity, but I do not have much material about all this, so I will just have to let it pass.

  

The Chinese in the August 1945 Revolution

  

Chinese society in Indonesia was relatively homogeneous [politically] prior to the August 1945 Revolution bursting forth. There were some incidents where they oriented to the national awakening in China itself. This divided the community into two groups. But after the emergence of [Indonesian] nationalism, the Chinese mainland was not an issue again. The Japanese invasion of China did not cause the community to divide into groups either. The fact that many of the prosperous families were able to educate their children also did not result in the community becoming factionalised. It is different today. Now there are three groups: Indonesian citizens, Kuomintang [supporters] and PRC [supporters]. They had not developed a strong political tradition, and the Dutch had continuously opposed and tried to hold back their political emancipation.

  

The Japanese occupation changed their attitude. They shifted from being apathetic about politics to becoming nationalistic, in the sense of being anti-Japanese.

  

At the time the revolution exploded onto the scene, the PRC was not yet a legal reality for Indonesia. Almost nothing was known of the Chinese Communist Party, especially as the white press here reported them as being no more than bandits. The Indonesian press did not pay much attention to overseas events during the period of occupation, giving all their attention to domestic developments, especially anything related to the struggle for independence. The question of citizenship was still an alien issue, as the law on citizenship, Law No. 3/1946, had been issued only eight months after 17 August, while the PRC only became a legal reality for Indonesia in 1949.

  

It seems that the Arab community found it easier to come to terms with the citizenship issue and accept citizenship because of the centuries-old religious ties. At a conference of locally-born Arabs from Java and Madura (in Solo on 25 July 1946, only three months after Law No. 3/1946 was issued), it was decided en bloc that they would take Indonesian citizenship. There was considerable suspicion at the time that their [the Chinese] social situation tended to mean that these people did not have deep roots in Indonesian society, but, rather, in trade, in the circulation of goods and money. Furthermore, the Chinese community differed from the Arab community in that it was divided into different [social] layers and ethnic groups. One of these layers, as described by Tan Eng Kie, included those who made their living as small farmers in Benteng after 1950. I think that the difficulties they experienced in determining their attitude would have been similar to those experienced by the Indians in South and West Africa or of Indonesians in the Philippines and Suriname when a national event occurred where they were non-integrated minorities.

  

But it is not at all true that the Chinese community was uninterested in the revolution. If there were some who helped the Dutch during the revolution, this should not startle us since the same thing happened within Indonesian society itself. My starting point in talking about the Chinese community is that they were [politically] homogeneous, they were not divided. Also at that time they all looked to the legally recognised Chinese government, a government recognised throughout the world, that is, the Nationalist Chinese [Kuomintang] government. The Republic of Indonesia held to this legal reality as well. In fact, it was China, after the Soviet Union, which, as a key country or stepping stone, enabled Indonesia to win wider contacts and support in the world.

  

That this China later moved across to Taiwan and was no longer recognised by the Republic of Indonesia was due to the foreign policy of Indonesia of not recognising two Chinas. Recognition of two Chinas was part of the divide et impera policy of Western imperialism, which Indonesia had fought so hard against. It was also part of Western imperialist doctrine of ‘letting Asians fight Asians’. In other areas, the rejection of capitalism by Indonesia meant that it was involved in the closing down of the activities of the Kuomintang in Indonesia in 1957, as the Kuomintang was an institution that was promoting capitalism, at least in Indonesia. In addition, the victory of the Communist army at Chungking was a result of the fact that the defeated party had not been able to look after the people properly. If they had been able to take care of their people, then the people would have defended them and they would not have been defeated.

  

So it was, Hs-y, that at the time of the August 1945 Revolution in Indonesia, the PRC did not yet exist.

  

Hs-y, do you remember how I explained the social pyramid and how the middle class was not a part of that pyramid? The disappearance of the colonial and feudal masters must have put the Chinese in a difficult position. For the mass of the Indonesian people, it was different. They spontaneously joined the revolution as they were at the bottom of the pyramid, which the revolution would overthrow. Generally the Indonesian bourgeoisie did not exhibit a very different attitude than the Chinese. It is this kind of situation, of a vacuum, where it would be relatively easy to launch provocations by manipulating misunderstandings among the Chinese community. However, very few such provocations succeeded. On 12 November 1945, in connection with the battle for Surabaya, Bung Karno explained in his speech:

  

Hundreds of Chinese and Arabs, innocent of any crime, peace-loving people, who came to this country only to trade, have been killed or seriously wounded. There have been even more casualties among Indonesians. I protest strongly against the use of modern weapons against the inhabitants of this city who have been in no position to defend themselves.

  

So, Hs-y, from the very beginning of the revolution many Chinese have fallen as victims. But it is indeed difficult for a community whose primary concern is trade to adopt a political stand, except on questions of trade. I think we can all understand this. Even so, from the first moments of the revolution, members of the Chinese community strengthened the ranks of the revolution. Injo Beng Hoat⁴, editor of Kengpo daily, just released from a Japanese prison on 9 October 1945, called upon the Chinese of Indonesia to stand behind the Republic of Indonesia. That this Hoat later took another path is a separate issue, no doubt not without its dynamics and own individual reasons.

  

Darker sides also emerged, and not infrequently. In mid-September 1945, there was a bloody clash in Medan and Pematang Siantar between Indonesian youths and Chinese. Yet the Chinese community quickly understood the situation and, on 17 September, issued the following statement:

  

1. China is a peace-loving country and has no desire to invade Indonesia or influence its politics.

  

2. The Chinese government exists as a reflection of the right of nations to self-determination and therefore, naturally supports and sympathises with Indonesian independence.

  

3. Chinese overseas in Indonesia are here as guests and not as elder brothers and therefore, have no desire to create conflicts with the Indonesian people.

  

4. Chinese overseas simply hope that they can contribute to the development of Indonesia in the economic field.

  

It can be extremely moving, Hs-y, to think how people can retain their common sense, even in the midst of prejudice, mistrust and the spilling of blood. So, it is no wonder then that just one month or so later, President Soekarno sent a cable to Chiang Kai-shek stating his hopes for friendly relations between China and Indonesia. At the same time, another blow for common sense was struck when, on 21 October, more than seven thousand workers, Chinese and Indian, went on strike in Singapore in sympathy with the struggle of the Republic of Indonesia.

  

The Chinese were not left behind in the press arena either. The Chinese newspapers, Seng Hwo Pao in Jakarta and the Democratic Daily News in Medan, both stood with the Indonesian people, supporting the struggle for Indonesian national independence. Both newspapers were published in Allied occupied areas in the face of threats and suppression by the Dutch. During the battle for Surabaya, in November 1945, many Chinese joined together to set up the Hua Chiao Chan Se Fu Wu Tuan, or Overseas Chinese Wartime Work Corps, which worked for the Indonesian army. Many Chinese youths took up arms and joined the battle on the side of Indonesia. On the ocean, it was Chinese who ran the allied naval blockade to bring in weapons and material for the Republican government. Many Chinese received awards for bravery from the army, and, indeed, some also were honoured as being among the 17 August Independence Proclamation Generation.

  

It was no accident either that the Chungking [Kuomintang] government defended the actions of the Chinese in Surabaya. And how did that come about? It was because a leading Chinese went on radio in Surabaya to report directly to Chungking the brutality of the British. Obviously, this Chinese figure did not do so just for something to do. He must have been motivated by genuine sympathy. Nor is it an accident that China and the Soviet Union were the first countries to make official statements of support for the struggles of the Indonesian people. Then, on 28 November 1945, the top leadership of the Indonesian Popular Resistance Forces in Surabaya urged the government to send out a mission, especially to China and the Soviet Union, so that the world would have an official and legitimate report on the brutality of the British in Surabaya. So, Hs-y, the real question then is: Why are the Chinese referred to as if they are completely bereft of any genuine commitment? The reality is that it is the Chinese who are closest to Indonesia and can do more to actually help the interests of Indonesia. This is reflected in the good relations with the Chinese of Indonesia. For Chungking itself, the Chinese in Indonesia are like a little China. And is it not also true that China has no imperialist past to account for with Indonesia? Perhaps some people will mention the Kublai Khan expedition as evidence to the contrary. Patience for now, I will write about the meaning of this invasion expedition later on.

  

China was also one of the eleven countries in the United Nations Security Council that discussed Indonesia. This was in Church House, London, 1946. There were six countries on the Council that gave support. I do not know why the Chinese representative did not appear to be so active.

  

When the Chinese Consul General Chang Chia-tung had an audience with the President in Jogja, the President explained that the basis of the Indonesian state was not so different from that put forward by Sun Yat-sen, Rabindranath Tagore and Okakura, namely, that Asia is one. I do not think this was just diplomatic politeness or play-acting by the President. This stand that Asia is one was later manifested in Indonesian foreign policy, including in the policy of recognising only one China.

  

Asia is one. We Indonesians do not feel free while Burma, India, the Philippines and China have not achieved their complete freedom.

  

This statement by the President turned out later to impact on the fate of several other colonies in Southeast Asia. It is no surprise that the Dutch colonialists broadcast the President’s statement throughout the imperialist world to warn them that their colonies would also be in danger if the Indonesian people’s struggle were to be recognised.

  

So here then was a strange contradiction. On the one hand, the Chinese were discovering the importance of supporting the struggle of the Indonesian people, while, on the other, Indonesians like Mr. Z. Zain and Dr. Sumitro were busy acting as advisors to the Dutch representative, Dr. Elco van Kleffens.

  

Returning to the Tangerang Incident

  

The Tangerang incident was not the result of some misunderstanding. The Dutch planned the incident as a means of extending their territory at that moment in the revolution. I touched on this a little in my earlier letter, but I think it is worth going into this issue a bit further.

  

On 15 April 1946, a platoon of republican soldiers was guarding Allied prisoners. They were cowardly attacked and wiped out by a whole company of Dutch. Of course, the republican government protested the barbaric act to the Allies. The Allies promised to investigate the incident. But the promise just remained a promise. Meanwhile, Dutch agents were actively spreading the rumour that it was the Chinese who were behind the treachery of the April attack! It was a time when the Chinese were an easy target for disaffection. This time, they were the targets of Dutch provocation. There were massacres. Nobody can defend what happened. Revolution is not about barbaric murder; revolution bears noble ideals. And more than that, revolution means consolidating one’s strength! The Republican Government itself did not defend this act. The massacres occurred just before the arrival of Dutch occupation troops in Tangerang on 13 June 1946. All this was the work of Dutch spies. The massacre provided the Dutch with the moral justification for their occupation of Tangerang, allowing them to further expand their occupied territories to the edge of Jakarta.

  

The Chinese who survived escaped to Jakarta. The official figures give eight thousand. Let me quote some statistics about Tangerang from the Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch-Indie. At the end of December 1905, the district of Tangerang had 107,000 Indonesians, approximately 12,800 Chinese, around 120 Europeans and 20 Arabs. The town itself was inhabited by 4,400 Indonesians, 1,350 Chinese and East Asians and about 20 Europeans. We might expect that the population would have increased dramatically during the 41 years between 1905 and 1946, as Tangerang was not only a fertile region but also had a handicrafts industry. According to a report by C.J. Hasselman, Tangerang exported between five and six million woven bamboo hats worldwide, mostly to France.

  

There was a victory for sanity when the republican government’s Minister for Social Affairs, Maria Ulfah Santoso, visited the refugees. Meanwhile, in Tangerang, the Dutch launched their own terror campaign of killing, kidnapping, torture and arson. There were even more victims than there had been earlier among the Chinese. This was a result of the brutal nature of a mercenary colonial army combined with the desire for revenge among Chinese who had been mistreated.

  

Those who point to the Poh An Tui as evidence of the sins of the Chinese should also be ready to acknowledge the bloody Tangerang incident. It was that incident that provided the justification for the Dutch to set up the Poh An Tui. And in any case, to judge the whole Chinese community just on these facts, without considering a whole range of other issues, is far too shallow an approach. But, be that as it may, Hs-y, it is the case of the Poh An Tui that is still used today as the justification for hostility towards the Chinese by those who do not want to understand.

  

In respect to this, I would also like to present a letter signed by one Haji Saifulanwar. The letter was published in the Patriot newspaper in Medan on 26 December 1959. The letter stated that houses, shops and kiosks confiscated by the Poh An Tui were to be returned to their original owners. The interesting issue raised by this letter is by what means and with what authority the Poh An Tui confiscated these houses, shops and kiosks. And if this did indeed, happen, how is it that once independence was achieved in 1950, local leaders failed to do anything about it but allowed the thefts to remain undisturbed until 1959?

  

The letter by Haji Saifulanwar goes on to say:

  

We all know about the criminal behaviour of the Chinese who became the Poh An Tui (city police) and who stole, raped and tortured anybody whom they liked to label as extremists and who were, in fact, freedom fighters struggling for the independence of the Republic of Indonesia. Shops owned by Indonesians or pro-Republican Chinese were confiscated and were occupied by the Poh An Tui and given to others in order to weaken the Republic’s economy and make Indonesia a second Malaya, where the minority group had become the majority.

  

Whatever sentiments the Indonesian people might have towards the Poh An Tui, this letter shows that there were also Chinese who sided with the Republic and who also suffered at the hands of the Poh An Tui.

  

Tangerang and the Chineezen-Vrees [Chinese Scare]

  

The Dutch strove with all their might during the August 1945 Revolution to make the Chinese the targets of their provocation. If this had succeeded, they would have crowed that they had no choice but to move their troops in to protect the Chinese. The Dutch knew that they had successfully implanted an anti-Chinese sentiment among the bourgeoisie in Indonesia, no matter what their nationality. (Compare this with the writings of G.A. Romer, ‘Chineezenvrees in Indie’, Vragen des Tijds, Volume II). As I explained in my fourth letter, the Dutch were also interested in destroying the Chinese. If their strategy of provocation had worked, they both would have a justification for moving their troops in to occupy more territory and would have destroyed the Chinese community.

  

The extremists among the revolutionaries were most easily provoked. In order to keep them under control, the President was forced to give the following warning in a speech on 30 June 1946:

  

Lenin himself, the great Russian leader, in his book ‘Radicalism: an Infantile Disorder of Communism’, stated that left-radicalism was a disease, a disaster, a danger; and, with such acts, without realising it, they had in fact been caught up in the game devised by the Dutch’s fifth column.

  

It is true that this statement was made in connection with the kidnapping of Prime Minister Syahrir, but it applied with no less relevance to the extremists who fell to the Dutch provocation in Tangerang. The Dutch were able cunningly to fuse together the anti-Chinese stand of the bourgeois Netherlands Indies government with that of the Indonesian bourgeoisie, but it was always Indonesian freedom fighters that ended up massacring the Chinese at that time!

  

Hs-y, these facts remind us that wherever the hand of imperialism interferes, we must be vigilant.

  

The Chinese Did Not Give Much Assistance to Van Mook

  

Hs-y, the Dutch continued to press down on the military positions of the Republican youth and army. This is normal in war, is it not? So the moment arrived when the Dutch attempted to consolidate all the anti-revolutionary forces, to undermine the authority of the Republic of Indonesia. Lieutenant Governor General van Mook (later it came out that the Dutch Queen never formalised his position because he was not a purebred Dutchman) organised the Malino Conference (15-26 July 1946) to form the states that would make up the Indonesian Federation, or the United States of Indonesia, which would compete for legitimacy against the Republic of Indonesia. This comprised regions outside of Sumatra and Java. In his book Malino maakt Historie, W.A. van Goudoever, the former editor of De Locomotief daily, presented the Dutch, Chinese and Arabs as the future minorities. The conference was attended by 39 delegates and several advisors from 15 regions in all. But how many Chinese participated in this? Three people: Dr. Liem Tjae Le, who represented Bangka/Belitung, Tiok Hiang Soen and Lauw, who represented West Borneo. So the score was 3 to 36. But it would be a mistake to judge the balance of forces pro- and anti- revolution among the Chinese and native Indonesians from these figures. First, the delegates were not selected through any democratic process. Second, they did not represent the people but rather, the educated layer close to the Dutch. Third, there was no way to see what psychological pressures were being applied. On balance, we can see that the Chinese did not play a big role in assisting van Mook and did not do anything en bloc to legitimise the Dutch charade.

  

Victory for Sanity

  

Hs-y, in the end, sanity must prevail over the small and insignificant misunderstandings that have no real effect on the revolution. The Indonesian people were also able to ensure that sanity prevailed. After his official tour through North Sumatra, Chinese Consul Chen Chuang Ping thanked the vice-governor of North Sumatra, Dr. M. Djamil, for the positive attitude of the people and the officials of the region. Four days later, on 7 September 1946, in an interview in the newspaper Suluh Merdeka, Chinese Vice-Consul Lie She said:

  

Relations between Chinese and Indonesians outside Medan are good.

  

And Hs-y, exactly one month after the proclamation of independence, there was a clash between Indonesians and Chinese in Medan and Pematang Siantar. Lie She, who also visited Pematang Siantar, said:

  

...there was plenty of evidence about relations between Chinese and Indonesians to refute the false accusations of the Dutch that Chinese do not feel safe to live in territory under the Republic of Indonesia. The various small misunderstandings between the Indonesian people and the Chinese will have no influence as long as the leaders act responsibly. All remaining disputes should be settled quickly.

  

As the journalist Jap Ee Tong from the Democratic Daily News put it: “All is splendid!”

  

Khoo Chin Sin, a journalist from New China added also: “Wherever you find the Allies, you will also find trouble!”

  

It is understandable that the revolution also had its excesses here and there. But these are only pieces of small, dirty foam on a great ocean. The Chungking government sent an extraordinary mission to Indonesia ignoring these small pieces of froth. It was headed by Dr. L.T. Chun and landed in Jakarta on 16 October 1946. A week later, he had an audience with the President in the Jogja palace. Even more important was the statement by the secretary to the extraordinary mission, Haji Usman Woo, in Jember on 20 November 1946, when he urged all Chinese in Indonesia to support the struggle for independence, as 400 million Chinese were in sympathy with the struggle of the Indonesian people.

  

The Chinese outside Indonesia also helped the struggle of the Indonesian people, even if indirectly. In Malaya, they launched a boycott of Dutch ships, and in February 1947, the Chinese labourers in Malaya refused to load or unload goods coming from or going to Holland.

  

Yes, we must also mention the role of the workers, should we not, Hs-y?

  

And so it was also that 3 May 1947, the Chung Hua Lao Kung Chung Hui, or Centre for Unions of Chinese Workers in Belitung, also launched a strike. It received economic support from plantation workers and various organisations and groups throughout Indonesia, so that the strike was able to continue for 105 days. Another 1,000 Indonesian miners joined this strike against the Dutch, who were gathering together all their economic strength to overthrow the August 1945 Revolution. The Dutch had to mobilise Indonesians from the villages under their control and other isolated villages to work in the mines. But as soon as these Indonesian farmers understood what was happening, they also refused to work.

  

The Chinese on Poh An Tui

  

The Poh An Tui not only aggravated Indonesians because of their bastardy and hypocrisy, but they aggravated the Chinese even more, especially those who had struggled sincerely and honestly to safeguard and consolidate a long-term friendship with the Indonesian people.

  

I myself see this organisation as part of the dark side of this whole issue. And a dark side can only exist if there is also a bright side, is that not so? And I think that we must always anticipate that every struggle will give rise to such dark sides, so that we can then limit them.

  

The height of bastardy committed by the Poh An Tui occurred in Panipahan and later was known as the Panipahan Incident.⁵ Panipahan is near Labuhan-Bilik.

  

On 30 September 1946, two hundred Poh An Tui soldiers landed and attacked. At that time, there were only fifteen Republican Navy soldiers on duty. The Indonesian navy soldiers were equipped with only simple rifles, and many perhaps had no arms at all. The Poh An Tui were not only well equipped, with weapons paid for by the Dutch, but landed using Dutch amphibious aircraft.

  

As I have said, the sane thinking Chinese, the majority, rejected the Poh An Tui. An editor of a journal that I know once told me that the editor of the daily Hua Kiau Jit Pau, namely, Tju Tje Hui, repeatedly opposed the Poh An Tui and published many articles that were strongly against them.

  

But what was the significance of the Poh An Tui in the struggle of the youth? And here, I mean the struggle of the Indonesian youth. It turns out that the Poh An Tui was a generous supplier of weapons. In every guerrilla engagement after the second Dutch military action, they were able to seize weapons that, this time, were not out-of-date, unlike the weapons available to most of the youth at the time.

  

But there is something I must tell you that is more important than this sickening Poh An Tui. This event is important because it was a manifestation of the progressive aspirations of the Chinese as regards the August 1945 Revolution. I am referring to a Chinese-Indonesia conference. This took place just a few days before the Panipahan Incident! In this conference the Chinese youth were conscious that they were not in a position to contribute manpower or weapons to the struggle because their trading traditions militated against the development of any kind of warrior spirit. But they made it clear that they could contribute strength in the areas of trade and finance. At this conference, the Chinese urged the Republican government to quickly implement their financial policies so that trade, and the economy in general, which had been so damaged by the Japanese occupation, could be normalised so that the lives of the people could benefit and thereby also help safeguard the revolution. Was this also not a form of rejection of the Poh An Tui?

  

The Chinese also made Sacrifices

  

Did the Chinese also make sacrifices for the revolution? Of course, Hs-y. There were sacrifices in the form of goods and services, made voluntarily, semi-voluntarily or involuntarily (these are the possibilities allowed by the human personality). But also, Chinese fell in almost every battle, because the Chinese lived among the Indonesian people. For example, in the battle of Surabaya, the Chinese women worked hand-in-hand with Indonesian women and youth, providing first aid. That there were traitors, too, among the Chinese in these battles should not be generalised to include all Chinese; this would be wrong, would lead us all astray, and would poison relations between the two peoples. For example, just recently, there have been reports of Indonesian criminal gangs carrying out outrageous acts in Manila. But this does not mean that all Indonesians in the Philippines are criminals.

  

According to a United Press report of 2 November 1945, the British killed sixty thousand people in the battle for Surabaya, among them, five thousand Chinese. Perhaps United Press exaggerated the numbers for the purpose of sensationalism, but the important thing is to register the 55:5 ratio. We can see from this the real position of the Chinese during the revolutionary period.

  

In the battles in Makassar, Banteng, Palopo, Maros and Bulukumba between the Dutch colonial and Australian forces on the one side and the people on the other, there were also many Chinese casualties. In December 1945, the allies also confiscated many houses, including 200 houses in Menteng, many belonging to Chinese. And when the British and Japanese launched a joint attempt to seize Semarang from the youth, they imposed a registration tax of one thousand rupiah on all households. This burden mainly fell on Chinese families who had remained in the city.

  

In the British air attack on Tasikmalaya, nine Indonesians and six Chinese were killed. A ratio of 9:6. This shows that the bomb fell in the commercial areas. There were Chinese also among the 45 killed by the Allied air attack on Cicalengka. It is possible that the figures given by Chinese result in a bigger ratio than expected because the Chinese were diligent in getting the reports to their consul.

  

Hs-y, I think I have talked to you enough now about the sacrifices made by the Chinese, either voluntarily or involuntarily. There is much more I could say but will not because it will just become boring for you. This is because the stories of these sacrifices get told separately from the evolution of the situation of the revolution itself.

  

Actually, Hs-y, I would like to say more about the role of the Chinese in politics, but there is not enough time at the moment.

  

Indonesians and Chinese: Both Victims of Imperialism

  

The Chinese were never the main helpers to the Dutch, either in commerce or government. The Dutch themselves became intent on removing the Chinese from Indonesia as early as 1740. However, their Christian morality and civilisation meant that they could not do that. And, as modern human beings, they also needed to be able to present some concrete justification, some moral justification, for doing such a thing. But they never found such a justification. So they created every kind of rule and regulation to squeeze them and kill them, but they were not killed off. So we cannot possibly conclude that they were assistants to imperialism. And if there were those Chinese who did choose to help the imperialists, it was because of their greed and their lack of understanding of history itself in Indonesia.

  

Before I conclude this fifth letter to you, I want to ask you to always remember one thing: No Chinese in Indonesia could possibly help their own murderers, except as a result of individual stupidity.

  

The Chinese are the friends of the Indonesian people, even though the Indonesian bourgeoisie looks upon them as an enemy.

  

It is from these good relations that I hope we can see grow a close, sincere and honest cooperation that can contribute to the welfare and peace of each nation, and of the world in general.

## The Contribution of the Chinese towards the Progress of Indonesia

  

Hs-y,

  

When people lose face or prestige again and again, they often hang on fiercely to their one last remnant of prestige, alive only in abstract fantasy: self-pride and arrogance.

  

It is this way, too, when it comes to relations between Indonesians and Chinese. This relationship, sometimes marred here and there by misunderstandings or small conflicts, has, on the whole, proceeded peacefully. This is because, indeed, the arrival of the Chinese in Indonesia was very different from that of the Dutch, British, French, Japanese, and even the Hindus in times long past. The Chinese did not arrive bearing weapons to kill. C. Lekkerkerker, in his book Land en Volk van Java, acknowledged:

  

The inhabitants of South China (and it was these people who travelled to the East Indies) had no desire to wield power, but only to win prosperity.

  

So in their relations with the Indonesian people, who so much prefer peace, there was bound to be a closeness and mutual understanding and a process of mutual influence and giving that were beneficial to both sides.

  

The failure of so many heroes to destroy this relationship has led others to deny the existence of these good and mutually beneficial relations that have advanced the interests of both parties. So C. Lekkerkerker, in his book, goes on to cover up the Dutch failure to get rid of the Chinese and presents the Dutch as protectors of the native Indonesians, saying:

  

By 414 AD there were already reports of Chinese on Java. It was rather strange that, despite there being five times more Chinese than Europeans and despite the fact that their country was large and near, yet their influence in culture and politics on the natives was very small.

  

And trying to show that the Chinese meant nothing to the native Indonesians compared to the Dutch themselves, he continued:

  

Their culture and technical civilisation were much older, but only slightly higher than those of the Javanese

  

While we, in fact, know that it was the Chinese superiority in shipbuilding – just to take one example – which ended the international trade carried out by native Indonesians. More important than the issue of their technical and cultural advances over Indonesians is the issue of their contributions to the development of the civilisation of the inhabitants of Indonesia themselves. Were there any such contributions? Were the Chinese good at nothing except business? Were they capable only of rottenness, for which they are now being sentenced in the form of concrete actions taken against them?

  

Hs-y, in this sixth letter I want to argue that there have been constructive contributions. So I do not agree with a recent statement by an official who, echoing the tone of C. Lekkerkerker, made a statement based on nothing but hollow arrogance, namely, that there is no need to be grateful to the Chinese. Of course, nobody can be forced to say thank you. But acknowledgement of contributions is recognition of a positive influence, and, if that positive influence has taken our civilisation a step higher, what is wrong in feeling some gratitude? A sense of gratitude is not some kind of self-humiliation, is it? Is it not a truly necessary feeling in relations between people, between nations?

  

So, Hs-y, nobody can deny the debt of Indonesian history owed to the writings of Chinese travellers. I think that without these contributions much of Indonesian history would remain lost. Were these travellers paid by Indonesians? I do not think so. Again I must emphasise that my intention here is not to raise up the Chinese and humiliate Indonesians. I just want a relationship that is reasonable, fair and that does not wander off track somewhere. At the very least, the Indonesian people have always been polite and civil, knowing how to be grateful, how to return a favour and who value the efforts of other people; if we find something else, then it is more likely we are dealing with the Indonesian bourgeoisie and feudalists and not the people themselves. And when we find these characteristics missing among people who have nothing, then we can assume that we are dealing with failed bourgeois and feudalists!

  

These reports by Chinese travellers, though often the oldest information available, have only recently been written up by scholars. One of the outstanding features of the writings of these travellers is that they always tended just to record the facts, unlike traditional Indonesian records that merge everything with fantasy. It is a pity that Chinese ideograms, which have otherwise contributed so much to Indonesian history, sometimes introduce confusion when they are forced to record the names of specific Indonesian persons or places. Well, every instrument has its limitations. But is it not true that these contributions are indeed valuable compared to the arrogant statements of some officials who perhaps have never read any Indonesian history? The history of their own people! Because they have been brought up on a continuous diet of Dutch education? And now, because of some accident, they sit somewhere as big politicians?

  

There was an anonymous article in the Republik newspaper of 3 February 1960, entitled ‘The Links between China and Ancient Indonesia’. In relation to the contribution of the Chinese travellers to our understanding of ancient Indonesia, the article read:

  

Although Chinese cultural influence did not result in great monuments, such as Borobudur, Prambanan, and so on, the writings of the various Chinese guests to Indonesia left other historical monuments in the form of their writings about Indonesia. From an historical and cultural perspective, these writings are no less important for Indonesian history than the Borobudur, Prambanan and Sewu monuments.

  

To be frank, Hs-y, I agree with this. Without the writings of these travellers, the ancient history of Indonesia would be represented by a deathly silence.

  

Chinese have written about Indonesia since the first century in the Christian era (see J.C. van Eerde, De oudste Berichten omtrent den Indischen archipel), and Jetiao, which we can guess is Djawadwipa [ancient name for Java], was reported by a Chinese traveller in 132 AD. There were also reports of visits by Indonesian ambassadors to China. Even from these brief reports, we can discover that our people already had advanced skills in shipbuilding and knowledge of the stars and the winds! But even more important, it shows that our people already had a government and a foreign policy!

  

For the fifth century, almost all information comes from the Chinese traveller Fa Hsien. Here we see that both commerce and religion played a role in bringing us this information. From the very earliest, commerce played a major role in relations between the two peoples. Prof. Dr. N.J. Krom, in his book De Hindu-Javaansche Tijd, free from the political need to cover up his own failure, acknowledged the importance of these Chinese reports.

  

The presence of ceramics – those innocent, mute artifacts – from the Han period (second to first century BC) in West Java, Lampung, the Batanghari areas and West Kalimantan, is tangible evidence that our ancestors received from these Chinese travellers things which we ourselves could not yet make and that, in fact, we learned how to make from the Chinese. If the people of Indonesia knew how to make them during that era, then there would have been no purpose in the Chinese travellers bringing them there. There is no point to salting the ocean unless you are mad! And there are several tribes among the Dayak in the Kalimantan interior who have expressed their gratitude by making these Chinese artifacts sacred. Some may laugh at these tribes, but if we look at this from an anthropological perspective, we can understand that this is just a primitive form of expressing gratitude.

  

Friendly relations between China and Indonesia were busiest during the sixth and seventh centuries AD, even though there were several rather sharp merchants from both sides who presented themselves as emissaries of their kings. There are many stories and legends from the time of our ancestors that describe this period of peaceful relations. It is worth looking at some of the evidence we can find slipped in among this legacy. In the Epic of Atjeh, compiled by Dr. Teuku Iskandar, which was published in Verhandeling van het Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal, Land-en Volkenkunde (Volume XXVI), we read:

  

So King Indera Syahpun was brought before the king of China and was given that which had been left behind by King Iskandar. So he was ordered by the king of China to build a palace in the king’s compound. So king Indera Syah was also given a bride...

  

This work was written after the arrival of Islam, as can be seen by the use of the title ‘Syah’ and also by the use of the Arab word ‘pupal’, which derives from the Arab word ‘fauful’, meaning ‘pinang’. In any case, this work clearly refers to good relations, free from any ill will, between the inhabitants of Aceh and the Chinese. And in the Minangkabau Histories, there is a section telling how there are blood ties between the peoples of Southeast Asia, as they all share a common bloodline from India:

  

... there were three sons of a king from the land of the Hindus who left their land to find other lands to conquer...

  

One, called Seri Maharaja Depang, travelled with his entourage to the east, to the land of China, then crossed over to Japan.

  

Another, called Seri Maharaja Alif, travelled with his entourage to the west, to the land of Rome. And another, Seri Maharaja Diraja, sailed on a ship in the direction where the sun lives, to find land and his five wives...

  

It is not that I am looking to show that there were passive relations between Indonesia and China, but rather, I want to show that these relations were not harmful to either party; in fact, they were of mutual benefit! It was then just a question of how the various rulers would channel these relationships towards specific interests. And throughout history, this relationship has never been led by a governmental leader. It has always been a people-to-people relationship, of course, with excesses that, in fact, did not need to occur. But none of this contradicts the proposition that the Chinese contributed to the advance of Indonesia.

  

The True Historical Significance of the Tributes to the Kings of China

  

In other classical writings, there are many mentions of tributes being paid by the Indonesian kings to the king of China. Chinese literature also describes the frequent visits to China of all kinds of delegations. Sun Yat-sen, in his book San Min Chu I, also emphasised:

  

... several smaller countries also paid tribute to China including the Lochoo islands, Siam, Borneo, the Sulu islands, Java, Ceylon, Nepal and Bhutan.

  

But, Hs-y, this tribute should not be interpreted as a sign of submission. As has also been explained by Krom, this was often done by cunning international merchants using the name of their king to obtain great profits for themselves. And because he did not understand that this was what these merchants were doing, Kublai Khan once sent an emissary to Kertanegara, a king of Java, to demand tribute when he realised that such tribute payments had stopped. It was from this incident that it became clear how international traders had been using the honour of their king and their country for their own benefit! One of the emissaries of Kublai Khan was even branded on his forehead with a sign of humiliation.

  

So this story of tribute shows it was purely a ruse of the merchants, although it also cannot be denied that there were kings in Indonesia who did submit formal tribute to the king of China. Still, the stand made by Kertanegara did help expose the rotten nature of the games played by these merchants.

  

And why did Kertanegara not send tribute to China during the rule of Kublai Khan? The answer is very easy! Kertanegara had been able to build a very strong navy, the strongest in all Southeast Asia. A strong naval cordon around these seas meant that the merchants felt secure and had less need to fawn before foreign kings to obtain guarantees of their safety. So as a result, the merchants did not need to resort to the cunning of paying such tribute.

  

The Significance of the Kublai Khan Expedition in the History of Majapahit

  

Several friends, using different words but conveying the same meaning, have told me that Chinese malevolence towards Indonesia can be seen in the expedition by Kublai Khan that attacked [the east Javanese kingdom] of Singasari. “Who can deny then that the Chinese have an aggressive spirit?” some ask. There can be no denying that the aggression took place. But can their attitude really be justified? Is it fair and just? Hs-y, I once promised you that I would examine this issue for you and now is the time.

  

You must know a great deal about the Great Khan whose exploits rocked the civilised world. The arrival of the Mongols destroyed the Kin Empire of the Sung Dynasty. Under the leadership of Genghis Khan, the Mongol nomad tribes swept down and plundered North China and Korea, then attacked the Khwarazmian Empire, razing the city of Bukhara, and then wiped out the city of Samarkand and its one million inhabitants, leaving only fifty thousand alive. The prosperous towns of Herat and Balkh were also wiped out. They then entered Persia and invaded Russia, so that their empire stretched from the Black Sea to the Pacific. And Kublai Khan was only the grandson of Genghis Khan and somebody who held great ambitions. Nehru wrote that the action initiated by Kublai Khan against the king of Java was not an act of annihilation such as that visited upon Baghdad by Hugalu (the son of Genghis Khan). According to Nehru, this was because of the Chinese influence! And was not Kublai Khan a governor for China appointed under Mangu Khan? And does this not mean that there would have been Chinese soldiers among his army also exerting some influence? The strange thing is, and I still do not understand this, why do Indonesian histories always call this army a Chinese army and not a Tartar army?

  

But let us put this aside for now. According to Krom:

  

As soon as emperor Kublai Khan established the new Yuan Dynasty, he began to take an interest in overseas affairs in an attempt to bring as much territory as possible under Chinese sovereignty, or at least to win recognition for Chinese sovereignty. So he sent his emissaries to many regions to seek a declaration of submission. Then he invited their kings to make personal visits to seek audience at the imperial palace. And behind all these requests was the iron fist of the Mongol armies.

  

Java attracted the attention of the emperor in 1280. But Kertanegara kept postponing negotiations until finally Kublai Khan lost patience. He sent his last emissary to Java in 1289. This emissary was branded on his forehead by Kertanegara as an insult to Kublai Khan.

  

Kublai Khan could not hold back his anger and sent a policing expedition to Java in 1292. But by that time, Kertanegara had been deposed by his own domestic enemy, Jajakatwang. Raden Widjaja, the son-in-law of Kertanegara, was able to engage in a manoeuvre and use the Khan expedition to overthrow Jajakatwang, establishing his own kingdom, Majapahit!¹

  

In most history books in Indonesia, usually nothing more is said about this expedition once its destruction is described. There is nothing to answer the question: Why was Majapahit under Gajah Mada able to subdue an area much larger than the land area of the Republic of Indonesia today when we know that even after four centuries, Srivijaya² never subdued even the equivalent of this land area? What is the secret hidden in all this information?

  

The answer is that there is such a secret, and it is to be found in the change to a more effective military technology, which, in turn, resulted in a change in military strategy and tactics. The new element was the use of chemistry, which transformed the power of weaponry: the use of senjata api [firearms] of some kind was introduced into Indonesia.

  

I cannot quite envisage what this senjata api was like. Matu Mona, in his Glory Era, telling the story of the occupation of the Brantas Valley by Kublai Khan, describes them as a kind of rocket. But is it true that the Chinese were familiar with rockets at that time? This is very possible, especially if we remember the small rockets we call now mercon [fireworks], which can fire into the sky and explode and which we use at the end of the fasting month and for other celebrations. Of course, such things would have been developed such that they were suitable for use in warfare at the time.

  

With regard to Majapahit obtaining new military technology, Jawaharlal Nehru wrote in his collection of letters to his daughter, Glimpses of World History:

  

In reality the Chinese expedition made Java or the Majapahit empire stronger. This is because the Chinese brought ‘senjata api’ to Java and it was because of these weapons that Majapahit won victory after victory.

  

Nehru did not describe exactly what type of firearms these were. Were they the kind of primitive rifle that we knew during the Indonesian revolution that the people called locok rifles, and that used gunpowder to fire shrapnel that would kill or maim whoever was pierced? But, whatever the form of these weapons, it cannot be denied that they entered into use on Java after the Chinese attack. Did Europe not also learn the use of firearms from China?

  

It is unlikely that there were very many of these weapons stolen from the Chinese. But by the time of Majapahit, the people already had metalworking and blacksmithing skills. Only three centuries later, in 1612, the armada of Pati Unus³ used cannons to attack the Portuguese in Malacca, about which W. Fruin-Mees wrote in Geschiedenis van Java, Volume II:

  

They were well equipped with their own cannon, as there were already excellent metalcasters among the Javanese.

  

So the question arises: from whom did the people of Indonesia develop the skills to make cannons as early as 1512, when Europeans, who began using cannons in the fourteenth century, only came in contact with Indonesians in the sixteenth century? These weapons quickly spread throughout Indonesia as Majapahit attacked. They were called pemuras in the Malay-speaking areas, peumuraih, keumaraih and meureuyam among the Acehnese, and mariem among the Javanese. The Minangkabau also started to make forearms called badie sitenggah, bedil setinggar or istinggar, taking the words from the Portuguese espingarda, the word for such weapons. We can find the same among the Balinese, Batak, Bengkulu, Karo, and so on.

  

And it is quite possible that Majapahit under Gajah Mada used cannons – cannons seized from the army of Kublai Khan and later cannons they made themselves.

  

So those pronouncements by my friends that the Kublai Khan invasion somehow reflects the evil role of the Chinese in Indonesia are way off mark. They ignore the other important aspects, including [the Chinese] contribution to the emergence and rise of the Majapahit empire, which everybody holds up for praise, regardless of its own imperialistic character. All this was made possible by the firearms introduced by the Chinese attackers.

  

Contributions Made in Peace

  

But you must not think that this expedition only brought weapons of death. Because China was ruled by a foreigner at that time, there were surely many Chinese who also wished to flee the foreign domination of their country. I am sure, Hs-y, that many of the soldiers on that expedition deserted and did not return to their homeland. This speculation is based on my observations of the ornamentation on Javanese and Balinese boats.

  

Hs-y, I much prefer to discuss the peaceful contributions of the Chinese rather than those stemming from the violence of war and represented by instruments of killing.

  

The Chinese have been making contributions to progress in Indonesia since the tenth century. Because these ancient contributions have not been advertised or become the subject of propaganda, their origins have been forgotten. The former Prime Minister, Ali Sastroamidjojo⁴ once wrote:

  

Since the first trade opened up between the two countries, Indonesia and China have been friends. The ships from China not only brought goods, but also traders, labourers, craftsmen, and so on from China. They lived in our country, bringing their skills and ancient culture from China. We can still find today many elements of that Chinese culture on many of the islands of Indonesia.

  

As far as we can tell, Chinese contributions to progress in Indonesia began in the tenth century AD. The Chinese had been in Sumatra since 942, bringing agricultural instruments and introducing them to the local farmers. In the Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch-Indie it is stated that Indonesian farmers use a short or shallow plough called a luku, and this tool was called a ‘Chinese luku’. It is clear this was a copy of a Chinese plough. Even today, many farmers in the Tangerang area use a similar plough. This was initially introduced by a Chinese named Tjo Huan Giok in the seventeenth century.

  

The contribution of the Chinese to agriculture, and thereby to prosperity, has not been small. This is even more important if we remember that Indonesia has always been an agricultural country. It was the Chinese who perfected the techniques for growing pepper in Indonesia. They devised a net to place around the stem of the pepper tree so that the plant would not spread everywhere but stay within the one location. They also kept trimming the tree of its leaves, which made it more productive. They also planted the trees closer together using more fertiliser. According to statistics from the Dutch colonial period, pepper plantations in Bangka, where the new methods were used, could carry 2,500 pepper plants per hectare, whereas in Lampung, where the old methods were used, they got 1,200 plants per hectare, a 100% difference in production. These methods are what magically transformed Banten into the biggest pepper producing region in the world, making its harbour an international harbour, a centre of world trade. In Bangka and Belitung, almost all the pioneers in planting pepper were Chinese. Even today, pepper is exported from Bangka and Belitung all over the world, ranking it as the number one exporter of pepper, producing 80% of the global output.

  

Indonesian tea production is now the fourth largest in the world. According to notes in the book Oud Batavia, Chinese tea was brought into Indonesia in 1681. In the Nederlandsch Oost-Indische Encyclopaedie it states that Jacobson brought Chinese experts in tea cultivation to Java in 1832 and 1833 to manage tea production. Then in Jin Huan Tse, or Short Notes on the Universe, it says that ‘Kelapa’ (they mean Java) had started to plant Fukien tea, which tasted delicious. The word ‘tea’ itself comes from the Fukien dialect, another indication that tea was brought here by the Chinese from China.

  

There was a very close relationship between the Chinese and the Indonesian people before Dutch colonialism started to raise obstacles to assimilation. This can be seen in the Chinese efforts in agriculture – their coconut and fruit plantations and their vegetable gardens. These not only meant more food, but they also brought in foreign exchange from the markets in Singapore.

  

Nobody will deny that sugar has always played an important role in the Indonesian economy, before, during, and since the revolution. It is true that the people themselves had learned how to produce sugar, but the new techniques introduced by the Chinese helped increase productivity and therefore, also the prosperity of the people. The Chinese introduced water-driven mills, and, if there was no water, they used buffaloes. These techniques were quickly adopted by the people so that Jepara and Jakarta were exporters of sugar by the sixteenth century. Even today, sugar is a key traditional product for East Java. The water-driven mills also remain important today in both West Java and West Sumatra.

  

The contribution of the Chinese in the field of mining also should not be belittled, although perhaps many people have forgotten this as a result of being concerned only with what is happening today. The Chinese were also pioneers in this area in times past. The Chinese role in pioneering tin production was not small; in fact, it is possible that the development of tin mining was much dependent on their initiatives. Tin is very important for Indonesia today as a source of foreign exchange. Indonesia is the second largest producer in the world, accounting for 20% of all production. It was the Chinese who pioneered tin mining in Bangka, Belitung and Singkep. Before the Dutch capitalists arrived with their modern machinery, the Chinese had introduced techniques previously unknown to the people. In the book by Polak, Pertambangan di India Belanda [Mining in the Dutch Indies], it is noted that the authorities in Palembang quickly recognised the Chinese skill in this area and sent to south China for labourers to open tin mines on Bangka.

  

The techniques used by the Chinese were the same as those used in China, namely, a water-driven mill to pull up the tin from the mines below. And they also used a Chinese-style tin smelter. This kind of primitive tin mining produced several thousand tons of tin for Indonesia. Meanwhile, in West Kalimantan, the Chinese were the pioneers of traditional gold mining and gold panning.

  

Opening Up Land for Plantations

  

The Chinese contribution to developing the national plantation sector, which has made Indonesia an exporter of plantation produce, also cannot be ignored. With extraordinary patience, resolve and diligence, they entered wild forest, which was not producing anything, and turned it into plantations that produced foreign exchange and created work for thousands of workers. According to records, they first started opening up forest in the sixteenth century, at least in so far as there were white people around to witness the event. One elderly Chinese man told the story of how Chinese coolies cleared the forest during the Dutch colonial period.

  

A Dutch capitalist, he said, mobilised fifty Chinese coolies to clear land for a plantation. They built a road and fences, put bridges across gullies, levelled the land, and so on. The plantation was supposed to be ready for planting within half a year. But after a year of work, there were only two coolies still alive. The other forty-eight had died of disease or snakebites or had been killed by tigers.

  

The Dutch capitalist deployed another fifty coolies to do the planting. Of these fifty, thirty-eight died. So, in order to create this plantation, eighty-four out of a hundred Chinese coolies had to die. The same fate befell the coolies from Java.

  

The Republik daily on 11 February 1960 reported the story of a Chinese contract labourer named Li A Er. This story also illustrates how the endeavours of the Chinese played no small part in the opening up and development of the Deli area and north Sumatra. The Chinese coolies were used, squeezed and when they had no more energy left, were thrown on the rubbish heap by their bosses and left to live in misery. Even today you can find many of these homeless people taken in by the Federation of Medan Chinese Associations and other social welfare bodies.

  

Here is the result of the interview with Li A Er, who lives in an impoverished dwelling about four kilometres from Medan:

  

When he was 26 years old in China, he was courted with the words: Leave and cross the South Sea. There you will receive between 1,000 and 2,000 yuan every year! Yuan was the currency under the Ch’ing dynasty. This was a lot of money in those days. Li was influenced by this, especially as it was difficult in China then; it was hard to make a living, and there were many people dying of hunger.

  

The first thing the Dutch did with these coolies purchased from China was they forced them to sign contracts where they were given an advance of 35 guilders. Twenty-one guilders were given to each coolie, the other 14 guilders were entered into the ledger as a deposit guarantee against the coolie breaking the contract. This happened to Li A Er when the Dutch sent him to East Sumatra.

  

While in East Sumatra, Li A Er was forced to clear the jungle for tea and tobacco plantations … then the Dutch would force him to clear more jungle.

  

This kind of barbaric exploitation by the Dutch was also practiced when it came to marriage. If a Chinese coolie wanted to marry a female Javanese contract coolie, then they had to agree to extend their contract, the man by two years and the woman by three years. So with each marriage, a couple extended their servitude by a combined total of five years.

  

In East Sumatra, Li A Er worked for twelve years as a contract coolie. Then he worked as a coolie on a wharf in Belawan harbour. He was let go when he no longer had the strength to carry heavy goods.

  

The exploitation of Li, and of other coolies like him, did not allow him to accumulate the slightest wealth, let alone the wealth that could turn him into an enemy of the Indonesian economy. He could not even afford food, so he had to surrender himself to a poor house. It is clear that it was not the Chinese coolies who were benefiting from all this but, rather, the Indonesian national economy. So, whenever you read about the tobacco auctions in cities overseas like Bremen, remember that among the shouting of the traders bargaining can also be heard the screams and moans of the Chinese coolies who lost their lives because of disease, or because they were killed by tigers or snakebites, but most of all by the greed of the Dutch colonialists. Not only is it unjust, but it is also hypocritical to deny the contributions they have made.

  

The blood, sweat, soul and life of the Chinese coolie were squeezed by the Dutch colonialist, and now, since the nationalisation of the Dutch plantations, the benefit has transferred directly to the Indonesian nation in this era of independence. There is a statistic that will speak clearly of this. Hs-y, between 1888 and 1931, three hundred and fifty-six thousand contract coolies were brought from China to Medan, and for sixty years the tobacco plantations have been dependent on these contract coolies.

  

The Chinese coolies, whether in Belitung, Deli, Bangka or in the mines of other plantations in Sumatra or Kalimantan, worked side by side with Indonesian workers, suffering the same fate and circumstances, and confronted the same enemy together: imperialism and Western colonialism. In relation to this, the words of J. Chailly Bert, in his book about Java and its inhabitants, are still very moving:

  

Apart from the Chinese, who is there who is prepared to mix with the natives, learn to speak the native language, live as the native people do, so as to win their trust?

  

It is only the Chinese who have shown a real intention to remain in Indonesia, to contribute whatever they have: skills, capital and experience. It is up to the Indonesian government to find a way to channel these contributions.

  

In the Field of Fisheries

  

In his book The Geography of Indonesia, S. Sutopo writes that several centuries ago the Chinese were already developing fishing in a village that had few inhabitants, called Bagan Siapi-api. This fishing village later developed into one of the biggest fishing regions in the world. The largest fishing region was Bergen, Norway, followed by Bagan Siapi-api. Every year 50 million tons of fish and prawns were produced to supply other towns. Just as the Chinese had created the port town of Gresik in the Middle Ages, so the Chinese created Bagan Siapi-api as the fishing town it is today. In 1930, 11,988 of the 15,320 inhabitants were Chinese, and 80% of them were fishermen. Exports of fish from Bagan Siapi-api in 1928 amounted to 5 million guilders. While these exports once benefited the Dutch, do they not now benefit the government of the Republic of Indonesia?

  

So how astonishing it is to hear some official accuse the Chinese of being small-scale monopoly capitalists because they own kiosks that monopolise the sale of salted fish, so they must all be viewed as economic criminals! We can see that while they may crow that their Chinese policy is not anti-Chinese or racialist, other times when they crow, out comes anti-Chinese and racist pronouncements.

  

In the Field of Small-Scale Timber Industry and Enterprise

  

In the field of timber, the Chinese, like the native people, have had to face wild animals and poisonous creatures each time they go into the jungles. Dutch Indies statistics from 1928 show the position of the Chinese in the timber industry quite clearly [refer to the table below: Timber Production for 1928 (in cubic metres)].

  
  

The small-scale end of this industry, such as furniture manufacture, was almost totally in Chinese hands. I am not sure how much was in their hands compared to that in native hands or how much was being produced. But we can make some estimates from the statistics, which I will explain to you in a minute.

  

A little while ago, a Chinese man from Surabaya visited me in my house. His name was Ong Thian Tjo. He told how he had come to Indonesia at the age of seven – he had been sold. Now he was 39 years old. “Why are you becoming a citizen of the PRC?”, I asked. And I knew he would not be able to give a firm answer.

  

“Because I was born in China”, he answered. But I could tell from the look in his eyes that this was not the real reason. There was something else – there was uncertainty about his future in Indonesia.

  

He lived in Surabaya and owned a small enterprise that manufactured picture frames. He was proud of his enterprise, not only because his product was as good as anything from overseas, as he said, but because he had also helped the country save a little foreign exchange.

  

Perhaps an anti-Chinese racialist will laugh at me for using this example. Is it not true that every person should have the right to be proud of what he has achieved? And it turned out that he had also been active in the battle of Surabaya against the Japanese-Dutch-British aggressors.

  

Can you imagine how hard it was for me to contain my emotions, Hs-y, when he showed me his resident’s card, then his citizenship card, then his permit to enter Jakarta? So this was the alleged alien monopoly capitalist who was an enemy to the Indonesian economy? What was clear was that the man before me, who had fought sincerely and genuinely in Surabaya, was not going to suffer PP 10. And he was looked upon as a criminal by journalists, who perhaps have never known the bitter suffering of struggle because they were enjoying themselves sitting around in the Netherlands.

  

“What was the turnover in your business, Bung?”, I asked. “Fifteen thousand a month”, he answered. Fifteen thousand is the same as $50! “What was your clear profit each month, Bung?”, I asked. “Around three thousand rupiah”, he answered. Three thousand was no more than $10. Can he really be considered a monopoly capitalist? What does this mean when compared to Standard Vacum, whose front fence alone is worth ten times $50? And do not forget there are thousands of Chinese like him, who are saving foreign exchange for the country because of their skills.

  

Perhaps there are those who will shout: but his is not a retail outlet that will be hit by PP 10! His is not a retail outlet! Such lowly insults can only come from the mouth of a bourgeois who knows no loyalty.

  

Contributions in the Field of Culture

  

If it is the case that the Chinese have made valuable contributions to the movement for independence, to industry, agriculture, fishing, and so on, their positive contribution is even clearer in the field of culture.

  

It is very typical for the Chinese to take their culture all over the world, including Indonesia. And Chinese culture has never revealed itself as wanting to imprison other cultures or as having tendencies in that direction. We can see how Chinese culture has been taken up in Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and in such a way that it cannot be said to be expansionist. This culture has been adopted voluntarily. And what has been the contribution of the Chinese in this field to the progress of Indonesia?

  

Kwee Kek Beng, in his paper ‘Sumbangsih Apakah yang Dapat Diberikan oleh Warganegara Indonesia Keturunan Asing kepada Pembinaan Kebudayaan Nasional Indonesia?’ [What Contribution Can Be Made by an Indonesian Citizen of Foreign Descent to the Development of the National Culture?] said:

  

When the ancestors of the Chinese in Indonesia first arrived, they did not bring religion, as did the Arabs and the Westerners, but they brought cuisine, which slowly became part of the food of the ordinary Indonesian people.

  

The West also brought cheese and butter, but these foods never became as popular nor were as cheap as bean sprouts, bean curd, taokwah, soy sauce, noodles, tea, black beans, pickled vegetables, and such others.

  

And the Indonesian people have never been forced to eat these foods. They were adopted voluntarily. It is the same with the adoption of folklore, which has taken place over the centuries, such as performing the barong dance in East and Central Java. This is clearly an adaptation of the Chinese dragon dance, even if the barong is too short and not really like a reptile. The barong here has entertained the people for centuries at festivals, celebrations, on important days and at weddings.

  

The same can be said of Capgomeh⁵, Pehcun⁶, and so on, which are not only festivals for the Chinese but for the native peoples as well, even though here and there local tastes have made themselves felt. In Tangerang, Pehcun is celebrated on the banks of the river; in the coastal towns of Sulawesi, it is celebrated on the beach.

  

There are still standing today scores of temples, which native peoples believe can provide blessings. For example, there are the Dampu Awang temple in Semarang and the Five Ancestors temple in Medan (see ‘The Five Ancestors Temple’, Republik, 21 February 1960).

  

Even R.A. Kartini, the person who began the modern century in Indonesia, in her book Door Duisternis tot Licht, told how she had been cured by Welahan tepekong. Before jujitsu and judo were systematically and scientifically taught here, kuntaw was a much admired form of self-defence and one which contributed much to the native form of martial art, pencak.

  

Chinese music has been influential for so long over the centuries, people no longer bother to investigate whether any particular form of music is genuinely home-grown or not. One example of this was presented by Kwee Kek Beng in his paper:

  

A few years ago there was a very popular tune in Jakarta called ‘Sipatmo’, which people thought was an Indonesian song. Somebody even wrote a pantun [traditional quatrain verse] for it. But it turned out it was a Chinese tune, namely, one called ‘Si Pat Moh’, or Eighteen Strokes.

  

And even gambang-kromong⁷, although it is being squeezed out every day by the din of popular western music singing of love and lust for all those who want to listen, is still broadcast by Radio Republic Indonesia, enthralling all those native listeners still free from prejudice. It is this music which for centuries has accompanied the lenong performances. And it appears that lenong itself is but an adaptation of Chinese drama from the Kuan Hantjing [Guan Hanqing] tradition, of course, with its own local embellishments and sometimes using stamboul, or the costumes of the nobles.

  

The art of batik, which has evolved to a high state in Java, may also even have originated in China and North Burma! This can be seen from the remnants of the batik craft, which did not develop further in those regions. The tradition of the blue stamp still exists in China and is similar to the use of indigo in batik. I am not saying, Hs-y, that batik definitely originated in China, but in my opinion, it is indeed a possibility. What is needed now is some research. As far as I know there has been no such research to date.

  

I base my opinion on the history of the Indonesian people and that the people who are Indonesians today are the descendants of migrants. These early arrivals would have brought a culture and civilisation richer than those of the people who were already living here.

  

Hs-y, people cannot deny that the Chinese-Malay language has had a big influence on the development of the Indonesian language. It is true that Chinese-Malay has many variants depending on where it emerged. The Chinese-Malay that has had most influence was that which developed on Jakarta. It was a fusing of Betawi Malay, the Malay used by the Chinese, and the need for a practical language of communication.

  

As I have said, the emergence of Chinese-Malay resulted from the need for a practical language of communication. This need was not only for the Chinese to be able to communicate to outsiders but so that they could communicate among themselves as well. They comprised several different ethnic groups that could not communicate with each other except through the Chinese script.

  

There are those in Indonesian society, mainly teachers of the Indonesian language, who belittle Chinese-Malay without taking onto account the social and sociological process related to the function of this mishmash of a language. They hold firmly to ‘book’ language, originally recognised and lauded by Raffles and then officially legitimised by the Dutch Indies, which was based on the works of Abdullah bin Abdulkadir Munsyi.⁸ They always fall back on these works. Whatever the shortcomings of this Chinese-Malay, it spread slowly in the middle of the eighteenth century concurrent with the growing Dutch unease over how many Asians were learning their [Dutch] language. In this arena, we cannot forget the name of Lie Kim Hok.⁹ His leadership in this arena is acknowledged by the well respected teacher of Malay of the time, Ibrahim gelar Marah Soetan (1857-1954) and also by Haji Agus Salim. Several pioneers of Chinese-Malay, such as Phoa Tjhoen Hoat and Phoa Tjoen Hoay, and several writers and other journalists have named him the father of Chinese-Malay.

  

A.F. von de Wall was of the view that Lie Kim Hok wrote a clean and sweet language, something which cannot be denied reflected his purity of heart.The influence of the Chinese-Malay of Lie Kim Hok spread throughout the Chinese-Malay press in Indonesia and became the standard for this mishmash language, strange yet easy and flexible. And after the collapse of Dutch colonialism in 1942, the Dutch language shut up shop and Indonesian formally replaced it. Since then, the influence of Chinese-Malay has entered official Indonesian as well.

  

How these Contributions have been Belittled by the White Imperialist-Colonialists

  

The white imperialist-colonialists used regulation and other forms of oppression, including monopolies, to marginalise both the Indonesian people and the Chinese from their respective arenas of action. This should have resulted in an uncompromising unity between the two groupings in opposition to these policies.

  

What happened instead was that each party has looked only to its own safety and has not wanted to know what was happening to the other. But there should not be this lack of concern with the problems of each other. The divisions successfully created by the Dutch are steadily producing a yawning gap between us. The result is that not only is there less and less daily contact between the Chinese and local people, but the Chinese end up silently accepting their oppression at the hands of the Dutch while quietly looking for ways to save themselves. The pity is that so many people do not understand the oppressive role of the Dutch in this matter, and so there arises anti-Chinese racism, the Chinese being a much softer and easier target because they are not in a position to defend themselves.

  

According to Abadi, 30 January 1960, K.H. Tjikwan, a Member of Parliament, accused the Chinese of receiving privileges and facilities from the Dutch oppressors which no native could ever receive. He based his accusation on an 1870 regulation issued by the Dutch Minister de Waal (it is not clear which regulation he is referring to). He also blamed the Chinese for the fact that there were three categories of subjects under Dutch rule: (1) Europeans and Japanese, (2) Chinese and East Asians, and (3) Inlander, or natives. The first categories received rights, privileges and facilities under the law that natives could never receive. Hs-y, I think this unfinished argument by Tjikwan is a joke. These regulations were needed not only for statistical purposes, for knowledge, but were also part of a divide and rule policy. The only party that can be held accountable for this is the colonial power itself that had the power to implement such regulations. This colonial policy has succeeded in building social structural divisions among us. They also succeeded in making these groups and the Indonesian people feel as if there were indeed differences in status and position between the groups in accordance with this categorisation. But their most glorious achievement is that even after independence there are still people who think in terms of these colonialist-created categories, among them being K.H. Tjikwan.

  

With the success of this population policy, the contributions of the Chinese have diminished. And at the same time, among the Chinese, the feeling that they should try to understand the needs of the native Indonesians has also declined. Of course, all this social fragmentation should not have happened, but it is often difficult for different social groups to control so many factors that impact them. Sometimes, not only have the contributions that once joined the two communities in intimacy weakened, but there also has emerged this anti-Chinese hatred based on false accusations. But no true contribution can, in the end, be denied.

  

How Should We View Every Contribution?

  

Every civilised people or group should be grateful for the kind of contributions that have come from the Chinese and which have helped the progress of Indonesia. I am sure too, the Chinese would feel grateful to the Indonesian people. Without the people, no Chinese – trader or otherwise – would have been able to make their lives here. Nobody can deny, of course, that among the contributions of the Chinese there have been those that have brought harm to the people, such as the habit of smoking opium or of maintaining certain existing forms of gambling. But I think that drugs and gambling are more a reflection of prevailing social chaos. These will disappear as society further progresses to a higher level. We must give priority to preserving our friendship, is that not so, Hs-y? Of course, opium has brought harm to the people. Almost all the school textbooks today carry warnings about drugs. But the most drug-dependent group is among the Chinese themselves, not among the native people. Approximately 1,847 mata of opium are smoked every year, of which only 397 are smoked by natives. In Java and Bali, the Chinese smoke about 70 times more per capita than natives, and outside Java, 670 times more [refer to the table below:Total Opium Smokers by Ethnic Groups (1936)].

  
  

Thankfully the policies of the government have been able to reduce the influence of opium.

## The Demographics of the Chinese in Indonesia

  

Hs-y,

  

Those infected with the anti-Chinese disease appear to be equipped with a special radar, one that quickly and diligently picks up each and every incident in society, of whatever kind – like a Peeping Tom, if we use the colloquialism – as long as such incidents can be used to inflame the disease that they themselves suffer: anti-Chinese racialism.

  

Yes, Hs-y, I raise my hat to their brilliance. But the problem is that their abilities in this respect are counter-balanced by a major deficiency: magically they adjust the form and content of these incidents that their radar picks up to make them compatible with their anti-Chinese disease. So the form and content that have been picked up on their radar are offered up, either retail or wholesale, but never contain any real value.

  

I would like to discuss the case of Dr. Liem Twan Djie. He is the author of the standard text De Distribueerende Tusschenhandel der Chineezen op Java, alongside one or two other standard texts on the Chinese in Indonesia by other writers. At the beginning of 1960, he was appointed professor of business economics at Airlangga University and delivered his inaugural lecture on ‘Business Economics and the Politics of Guided Economy’ (Java Post, 29 January 1960). We can assume that such a person will have examined thoroughly the whole issue of PP 10 – its costs and benefits, short-term and long-term – from both a scholarly and practical point of view. The word is that he is a member of a certain political party that itself is now beating the anti-Chinese drum. What I was getting at earlier was, well, why do the members of his party not ask him what he thinks? Will he not have a better understanding of the problem than those just beating the drum of hatred? Or perhaps, indeed, he is not a member of any party. Or perhaps again there will be those who say his silence means he actually agrees with all this commotion. Well then, Hs-y, perhaps I should give another example. Another professor, with whom I am acquainted, also said to me that it is best that those of foreign descent should stay quiet so as not to inflame prejudices even further. Perhaps I am talking all over the place now. But I can never forget one thing in all this. The racialist anti-Chinese will change the form and content of any incident that their radar picks up with just one thing in mind: the destruction of the Chinese in Indonesia, to vanquish the Chinese from the face of the earth, and to prevent them from living in any country anywhere. Or most horrifically, the Chinese are just something to wipe their feet upon. So, whether they like it or not, they end up on the side of the imperialists. And so then, Samandjaja in the Republik swept away these prejudices when he published a quote from Kane O’Hara [an eighteenth-century Irish dramatist]:

  

When the judgment is weak,

  

The prejudice is strong.

  

We can see how prevalent these voices are that want to wipe the Chinese from the face of the earth by looking at all the words they use in their efforts to try to eliminate every newborn Chinese baby. Listen to these voices:

  

The foreign traders are already busy being offered Rp 30 thousand. It is as if they have some plan here.

  

(Pikiran Rakyat, 9 July 1959)

  

They want it to look as if our government has no concern about their fate at all.

  

(PIA, 5 January 1960)

  

They have been able to start their trade again by deliberately conducting a go-slow.

  

(PIA, idem)

  

Duta Masyarakat has been at it one year:

  

Anti-’tauke’: Are the Chinese Communists or Capitalists?

  

(H. Mahbub Djunaidi, ‘Support for the Ideal of Collaboration Between Islam and Nationalism’, Duta Masyarakat, 20 January 1960)

  

The PRC people go home taking black market foreign exchange, manipulating supply of goods, and raising prices madly.

  

(Suluh Indonesia, 20 January 1960)

  

If I investigate these Chinese and the situation they pretend to be in, I can see that they are not the groups that have a great hold over the commanding heights economy of the Indonesian people. But for decades they have wielded power over all that is needed by our farmers, whether it is through credit, money-lending, trading in day-to-day consumer goods, from emping crackers to wall lamps.

  

(H. Mahbub Djunaidi, ‘Support for the Ideal of Collaboration Between Islam and Nationalism’, Duta Masyarakat, 21 January 1960)

  

None of this drumbeating is free from prejudice because those beating these drums are indeed unjust in their outlook. There are many other voices also not worth listening to, many published in the daily Nusantara, which I could also advance as examples. But I do not think it is necessary. These statements are of no value; indeed, they are close to being the words of people with a mental condition. You can see clearly in their words the hunger for victims, the hunger to take lives, the thirst for blood and their narrow outlook. They show a complete disinterest in any other viewpoints or information that explain how all these things have come to pass (insofar as things have happened and are not just their false fantasies). None of them dares to look at the social system itself, which permits anybody to do what they like, except where the law has given the police the authority to stop activities. Have the police taken action against any such activities that have provoked these people to hysteria? It is outside my competence to answer this question. What is clear is that their prejudice against the Chinese must be kept alive. If these prejudices decline, then these people will lose their source of livelihood as slander mongers.

  

But it would be unfair if we did not expose the origin of this hate-spreading commotion, which so shames Indonesia as a free, modern and civilised nation. The origin was none other than Asaat. He began this whole spreading of hatred at the All Indonesia National Congress of Importers held 19-23 March 1956, in Surabaya. The real shame here is that he is a former Acting President of the Republic of Indonesia. He said:

  

Indonesians are clever farmers, but they are not clever at selling what they produce. It is the peasant farmer who heads off to the paddy field, but the rice mill and trade is in the hands of the Chinese, who take a great profit from this. It is the peasant farmer who plants the rice, but the tobacco trade and cigarette factories are in the hands of Chinese. It is the farmer who plants the soybean, but the soybean trade and exports and the tofu factories belong to the Chinese. It is Indonesians who go into the forests to look for rattan, but the rattan export trade is controlled by Chinese. It is Indonesian fishermen who put their lives on the line to catch the fish, but the fish market is controlled by the Chinese. It is the Indonesian people who produce batik, but the bulk of the batik trade is controlled by the Chinese.

  

The Indonesian people have shown that they make good films, but the cinemas are in the hands of the Chinese. The textile mills, the tile and ceramic factories, and almost everything are in the hands of the Chinese. The coastal and inter-island shipping are controlled by the Chinese. Transportation of both people and goods, by ship, bus, and down to the trishaw, is all controlled by the Chinese. It is an Indonesian who drives the trishaw, but a Chinese ‘tauke’ who gets rich. And so it goes…

  

(Central KENSI Working Group: KENSI Struggles)

  

Hs-y, this overly long quote does not really do justice in showing how the Chinese were made the target of attack through all kinds of falsification of history. Their detractors transform all these incidents that are picked up on their radar and turn them into clubs with which to bash the Chinese. And so these heroes of hate-spreading turn everything into weapons to kill off this group that cannot defend itself. I think I should say, too, that even an undeniable fact loses its significance if it is separated from the source of the problem, that is to say, from the main, primary problem. This fact is just a product of the primary problem. What might approach the total truth comprises these facts together with the primary problem that gives rise to these facts. I say “approach the whole truth” because the whole truth is the truth itself, not a reproduction of the truth. Is that not the case?

  

But, even so, I think these examples are enough to reveal what the real character of these people is. They may pretend to be socialist, nationalist or religious leaders, but these pretensions cannot disguise the real intent in their hearts: to end the presence of the Chinese in Indonesia.

  

I admit that this issue of demographics is not so interesting. But this personal predilection must be put aside so we can deal properly with the issues that we are facing.

  

The First Population Presence of the Chinese

  

It is not clear when Chinese first started living in Indonesia. Science has only gone so far as to make guesses based on the findings of a few ancient artifacts. But there is no written evidence of any kind until several centuries after Christ. Nevertheless, the artifacts that have been discovered have revealed in their own way that Chinese have been here since before Christ.

  

Orsoy de Flines, an expert in porcelain, discovered Chinese porcelain, or objects with a Chinese influence, in West Java, Lampung, in the Batanghari region and West Kalimantan, as well as stored in several different kraton [residential compound of a ruler]. All this tells us that the Chinese have been here since ancient times, making contributions to the culture of the Indonesian people. It is only natural that every meeting between cultures with different origins and different courses of development results in an exchange between those cultures. Although these objects are not accompanied by written evidence that can tell us all we know, I tend to think that such exchanges took place. I do not accept the views of Prof. Dr. N.J. Krom that:

  

In contrast to the experience with the Hindus, there is nowhere to be seen any evidence that the native inhabitants have adopted any aspects of Chinese culture.

  

My rejection of this assertion is based on the evidence of Chinese influence in music, theatre and cuisine, just to cite a few areas. These influences remain visible today even though modern pretensions often mean they try to hide these influences.

  

Other artifacts that point to the presence of Chinese habitation during prehistoric times are polished stone axes from the Neolithic period. These axes share some distinctive similarities with emerald and jade axes used in China at the same time.

  

Still other artifacts that lend credence to a Chinese presence in prehistoric times are large bronze gongs belonging to the Dongson Culture, originating from a village in Tonkin called Dongson. These gongs, found in South Sumatra, have similarities with gongs from the Han dynasty. Heine-Geldern has concluded that these gongs were made by Chinese and that, therefore, this indicates that Chinese were in South Sumatra thousands of years ago. But I think Heine-Geldern may be mistaken in his conclusions in this case. These gongs were the type used in war; they would have been repeatedly beaten as soldiers marched in rows. When I was in China, I saw that there were many such gongs from many areas, although each region had its own decorations or form. It is clear they were widely used in war. According to van Leur, the Chinese who came to Indonesia were peaceful. And such gongs have never been commonly used in Indonesia. So I tend to think, rather, that these gongs were presents from the kings of China to the different kings in Indonesia. But it is also possible that they belonged to groups of soldiers who deserted from their mother army and decided to reside in Indonesia. According to Krom, this is also how the Hindus came to Indonesia.

  

The strong Chinese influence in weaving, in silver and bronze artifacts, and so on, and the marriage in some cases of Chinese and native [design] elements – even though none of these were made by Chinese but by native inhabitants – show clearly that there has long been a peaceful and harmonious Chinese presence among the local peoples.

  

Even though the evidence may be slight, we have enough to guess that there was a Chinese presence here in prehistoric times. The geographic factor – the relative barrenness of China compared to the fertility of Indonesia – would confirm the speculation that they would like living in Indonesia, as was confirmed later by the various waves of arrivals in the period after the birth of Christ. And the peaceful character of the Indonesian people, who welcome their guests, would have strengthened this attraction.

  

Chinese Population Movements after the Birth of Christ

  

At first glance, travel from Indonesia to China might appear to have been confined to exchanges at the level of royalty alone. But it would be incorrect to limit our view here. There was already knowledge of each other in the two countries. Such a familiarity could have developed only as a result of friendly traffic among the peoples. I say ‘friendly’ because there was no evidence of any military hostilities between the two countries during this period. The relationship was not based on fear of one country by the other. It is true that there is historical evidence that some delegations to China by Indonesian kings were apparently seeking recognition of their sovereignty. But there is no reason to conclude with certainty that this was based on an Indonesian fear of China. This seems not possible if we remember that, at the time, the state of the development of Chinese ships – junks – had not reached the level that it did later in the Middle Ages, when China felt the need to extend its influence to countries across the seas.

  

During the Han dynasty, under Emperor Wang Mang, China already knew of Indonesia. The Han chronicles mention Indonesia, referred to as Huang-tse. They describe the inhabitants as being the same as those from Hainan and making their living from the pearl trade and piracy. Emperor Wang Mang had requested a rhinoceros from this country.

  

These brief reports in the chronicles suggest that China only knew of Indonesia from the international traders who visited China. However, the later expedition of the Chinese emperor to bring back the rhinoceros shows that the Chinese knew the sailing route to Indonesia.

  

Similarly, Chinese reports from 132 AD of a visit to China by King Dewawarman from Djawadwipa [Java] show that Indonesians also knew the sailing route to China.

  

Hs-y, I think it would be useful for me to discuss briefly the writings of Fa Hsien¹. I mentioned in an earlier letter to you how it took a year for Indonesian and Chinese travellers to journey between the two countries because of the winds. It is understandable that not many Indonesian travellers decided to reside in China, given its relative barrenness, so that making a living would be more difficult. On the other hand, it would have been much easier for Chinese travellers to fall in love with Indonesia during the six months they had to wait there and then decide to stay in Nusantara. It is easy to conclude then that there were many Chinese living in Indonesia during this period.

  

The reports by Fa Hsien from the fifth century only confirm this. The reports of I-tsing² from the seventh century also tell of a close relationship between Chinese pilgrims and local Indonesians. The pilgrims were often invited to travel on board trading ships heading for India. Hwui-ning, a legal expert, lived in Java for three years in the seventh century. And there were already Chinese Buddhist priests residing in Indonesia, or at least staying for long periods. Krom wrote about this:

  

The language of this country was called Kw’un-lun; clearly this was old Javanese. This term was used by the Chinese, it seems, everywhere they came across the indigenous culture mixed with Hindu elements and speaking this mixed language. If the Chinese Buddhist priests saw advantage in learning this local language for their studies, then it would be logical to think that the language had a role in teaching...

  

It also can be clearly shown that there were Chinese populations much later, in the time of King Erlangga, in Tuban and Gresik. And there were already known Chinese colonies in Jepara, Lasem and Banten.

  

But more important than all this data is the question: Why is it that they were able to and, indeed, desired to stay in Indonesia? The answer is not so easy to find; it was because the local people were willing to mix with the Chinese – the local people protected them and received them as friends. And this is more important than all the bits of evidence about whether there were Chinese present in this era or that.

  

Chinese Population during the Rise of Islam

  

Hs-y, actually there is not much to say about this period. In the history with which we have been familiar, there has not been much reported about them. It is possible that all the wars between the kings in their struggles to expand their territories forced the Chinese to withdraw. I do not know. There are also no reports about them during the period of inter-island wars over the key points in international trade. And it seems that during this period of wars, the Chinese were also able to escape any disasters. But, of course, there were a few who left an influence among the ruling nobility because of some skill or expertise that they possessed; they were thus granted local titles. This can be shown in their influence in architecture, interior décor, the art of carving and so on.

  

This is a challenge for research, whether for indigenous Indonesians, those of foreign descent, or Chinese. I do not think I am competent to assess this matter. What is clearer is the disposition of the Chinese in the century that Indonesia came into contact with white people.

  

The Chinese Population in the Era of Dutch Colonialism

  

In the sixteenth century there were reports by white people of a Chinese presence in Banten, as well as in many other parts of Indonesia. They lived peacefully with the local inhabitants and were engaged together with them in endeavours in industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishing and other enterprises. By the end of the Dutch occupation, at the time of World War II, there were five times as many Chinese as Europeans. They helped build the cities of Gresik, Tuban, Banten, Jepara, Batavia and even Singapore. Let me quote for you what C. Lekkerkerker wrote in his book Land en Volk van Java:

  

The Chinese who came to Indonesia, leaving their homeland, were the poorest from their troubled country. They came in small groups. They came from South China, and they had no desire for power, but just wanted to seek a livelihood. They never constituted any kind of united group. They used many languages. They often could not understand each other – even communicating through writing was difficult. In the beginning Europeans saw them as being all the same.

  

Most of them came from the southern part of Fukien³, a barren province of ten million inhabitants almost the size of Java and located across from the island of Taiwan. Lekkerkerker suspected that these people from Fukien started arriving in Indonesia 800 or 900 AD. The peranakan [locally-born] Chinese are their descendants. Women never joined these migrations to Indonesia. So we can imagine how the mixing of blood between Chinese and local people occurred over the centuries. And usually the Chinese from Fukien had more success in finding prosperity than Chinese from other regions.

  

Hokkien Chinese can be found on the east coast of Sumatra, in Banjarmasin, Makassar, Menado and Ambon, as well as on Java. There are many in Riau although only a few in Pontianak. The fishermen of Bagan Siapi-api and Bengkalis are also mostly Hokkien Chinese. Many of those in and around Jakarta and Medan are farmers.

  

Hakka, or Keh, Chinese are the next largest group. They came from a region to the south of Fukien, in Kia-jing north of Kwantung, or Canton, as well as from the far western part of Fukien province. They are people from the interior. It is suspected they were originally from North China and then pressed down into Kwantung⁴. At the time Lekkerkerker wrote his book, the province of Kwantung had 32 million inhabitants and was twice the size of Fukien. Most of the Hakka were coconut and rubber plantation workers (and also earlier mine workers) in West Kalimantan, and they began to live there between 1740 and 1745. Most of the labourers in the mines on Bangka and Belitung were also Hakka. The same for the East Sumatra coolies and the timber cutters. There were some who ended up in Java, usually bonded under some contract. They ended up as carpenters, blacksmiths, and so on. The Hakka that migrated to Java were called Makao. The wealthy Hokkien Chinese looked down upon the Hakka.

  

A less important group was the Tio-tsu [Teochew], or Hoklo, who are often called the Swatow Chinese. They came from the Tio-tsu region and the Hai Fung and Luh Fung western coastal region, also in Kwantung, on the border with Fukien. Their dialect also indicates they are of the same family as the Hokkien. There are not many in Java. Many became coolies in East and South Sumatra and also in Bangka and Belitung. But there are many in West Kalimantan, where they have been long-term residents.

  

The smallest ethnic Chinese group in Indonesia is the Kwong-fu [Cantonese]. They came from Kwantung and came to Indonesia from Hong Kong. They usually suffered worse conditions and made their living wherever and however they could. It is also the reason why they are the most dispersed of any group throughout Indonesia. More than 40% work in the handicrafts sector, while in Sumatra they work in agriculture and plantations. Those who landed in Bangka and Belitung usually immediately became mine labourers. In Palembang and East Kalimantan they became handymen or worked in the oil fields. Finally we can mention the Hai-lam, who came from Hainan Island and the peninsula across from the island. Most of the peranakan Chinese in Indonesia no longer remember their origins.

  

As with the native population, the Chinese population grew quickly. This was partly due to the strong desire of the immigrants to move to Indonesia and also due to biological population growth, so that in just ten years they grew by 52%.

  

So from these tables [refer to the tables below: Chinese in Indonesia, Born In or Outside Indonesia, based on Notes of October 1930, and Chinese Ethnicity in Indonesia, 1935], it is clear that 20% were in Java and 51% outside Java. 32% of the Chinese in Indonesia were born outside Indonesia as of October 1930. Of the 750,000 Chinese born in Indonesia, 500,000 had Chinese fathers.

  
  
  

57% of the Chinese in Java and 23% of those outside Java worked as peddlers, with many more running small shops or street stalls.

  

Since the days of the colonisation, the Dutch knew that the Chinese were not reluctant to open shops even in the most remote areas. And according to Lekkerkerker, they never took unfair advantage of the situations in which they found themselves. They spent only a little of their earnings. This is the secret of their success, with some of them becoming very wealthy individuals. Lekkerkerker went on to say that the view that the Chinese who landed in Indonesia became rich quickly is just a fantasy. Lekkerkerker also rejects the agitation that among them were those too steeped in money-lending and smuggling. Their success in trade was due to their willingness always to bargain and take risks. But he does not accept that they were any more involved in money-lending or smuggling than the native inhabitants.

  

Singkeh and Peranakan

  

The Chinese have traditionally been divided into two groups since Dutch colonisation, singkeh and peranakan. Most of the former live outside Java. Between 1888 and 1931, 356,000 contract coolies were brought from China to Medan. These were the singkeh, which literally means ‘new guests’. They were totok (of pure Chinese descent), and some stayed while others returned to their homeland. The second group, the peranakan, constituted those born in Indonesia. During the period of Dutch colonisation, both the East Indies government and the Chinese themselves called both groups by the modern term Hoakiau, meaning ‘Chinese travelling away from home’. The name Tionghoa is the modern word for China.

  

Most of the peranakan are on Java. They are the descendants of totok men with native women, or from peranakan women as well.

  

The singkeh are stronger physically than the peranakan and as a consequence, are more often to be found doing hard labour, such as in the plantations and mines. They also have a lighter skin colour.

  

Although the peranakan, especially those in Java, have lived here for several generations and have mixed their blood so often with indigenous blood, yet they are still able to hold on to most of their Chinese characteristics. They do not become natives. It is true they mix with the local people, but this has never resulted in a fusion. Where intense assimilation has occurred, it is because of some different characteristic of the indigenous people. According to an American writer, this is the result of the religion of seed, which says that the Chinese seed, or tsing, always produces a Chinese no matter from what womb a child may emerge.

  

Hs-y, I do not agree with this view, although it is the basis of the Chinese family system. In my opinion, there are two reasons for the slowness of assimilation. Their position in society, as a group that appears obviously different from the local population, results in their adopting a posture that reflects that differentiation. Secondly, the social situation that they find themselves in makes it difficult for them to assimilate. This is not to say that they have never assimilated or have not wanted to assimilate. But for a people with such an ancient and great culture, and one which is so greatly honoured, it is not easy to assimilate, especially with a people whose cultural development is not at the same level. Assimilation can be carried out by a group that is unable to defend its traditions and culture, perhaps because its level of learning and culture has degenerated compared to previous generations, or perhaps because of frustrations that develop in the life of the family – in short, if life as a Chinese no longer fulfils its needs.

  

Naturally, the peranakan were in a better position to assimilate than the singkeh.

  

The Rapid Population Increase of the Chinese

  

Hs-y, the rapid growth of the Chinese population, 52% in ten years, is truly a record that is hard to beat. But the secret to this is not the tsing, or devotion to the seed, but, rather, the patriarchal family. For the tsing is just a symbol of this patriarchal character. According to their beliefs, the emperor is accountable to God for the welfare of his people, and so, too, is the father responsible for the welfare of his family. The role of the father is so important, Hs-y, that whenever I think of the intense patriarchal system in China, I always think of the novel by Pa Chin, Family. In this story the grandfather is the sole decision-maker for all his descendants. This results in the family having just one personality, that of the patriarch, the founder of the family, the father.

  

You would know more than I would about this family system and its intense consequences for ethics and piety.

  

Piety in their beliefs goes back to prehistoric times and is honoured even today by the Chinese overseas. In the Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch Oost-Indie, Volume I, it is, in fact, written that:

  

One of the characteristics of the Chinese in Indonesia is that they continue to uphold the religious traditions and customs of their ancestors. As a result, their family life remains almost wholly as it was in China.

  

All this goes back to the patriarchal character of the family, which, in turn, is based on religious faith and belief, so that the Chinese family must be viewed as both a social and a religious institution. The family embodies the creation, forming an unbroken continuance of life itself. The religion of seed, or the devotion to the seed, is so strong that a family comprises nine generations and an elder brother will consider the male child of a younger brother as his own son, and cousins are considered as brothers to each other.

  

The obligation to maintain continuity here gives marriage a holy task, indeed the holiest of tasks, namely to bring forth sons. To die without having sons is a sign of insufficient hao – of not being sufficiently diligent in worshipping one’s ancestors. So somebody who has no son will be obliged to adopt a son, sometimes even after he is dead. The elders of the family will carry out the adoption. If the (main) wife has no sons or too few sons, then more sons will be sought through concubines. The belief in the absolute necessity and obligation for as many sons as possible has given birth to the practice of maintaining concubines. But this practice should not be viewed as a practice that should be condemned as such, as it, too, is an extension of belief and piety.

  

Relationships between man and wife, in accordance with the patriarchal system, are based on veneration and obedience. The duty of a woman is to give birth to as many sons as possible. Only if this duty is carried out properly will she be given any respect by the family. So it is clear that the duty of every man is to reproduce as much as possible the devotion to the seed and to spread the seed as much as possible. Given this outlook, with its emphasis on the preservation of the family, it is not surprising that they believe that the spirits of their ancestors still dwell among the family.

  

It is these beliefs and system that ensure that Chinese, including those in Indonesia, no matter how much their blood has mixed with the local people, will retain their Chineseness; they are still Chinese. Sun Yat-sen in San Min Chu I theorised on this:

  

If this ethnic sentiment can be developed, perhaps we can also develop a sense of nation on this basis ... It appears that one easier and more successful method of developing a Chinese unity will be by using the ethnic and family units as a basis.

  

But the reverse has been the case. These patriarchal families have instead been obstacles to the fusion of this sentiment into a national framework, as was proven later in the social and political developments under the Kuomintang regime.

  

But let us leave this behind and continue with the pessimistic outlook of Sun Yat-sen caused by the decline in reproduction of the Chinese people:

  

There is a third danger threatening us. During the last hundred years, the Chinese people have not increased their population. The same will occur in the next hundred years if we do not find a way to increase the total number of births. During the century just passed, the United States increased its population ten times over; Russia four times over; Britain and Japan both increased by three times; Germany by 2.5 times. France’s increase was the smallest, but even then it increased its population by a quarter. So while their population increases every day, the Chinese population decreases. Study our history!

  

While the Han ethnic group (the Chinese) expanded its population, the indigenous peoples such as the Miao, Yao, Lao, Tujung and others vanished.

  

So Sun Yat-sen held the view that increasing the population was one way to ensure that the Chinese people would not be swallowed up by the foreign powers surrounding them. The religion of seed, which was originally a part of faith and belief, was to be transformed into a basis of political strength. But whether such an approach would work would depend on the national and international political developments that followed. What is clear is that the religion of seed outlook also found its way into the ideas of Sun Yat-sen. And so we can imagine how deeply these ideas must have taken hold among his followers.

  

The pride of the Chinese people over the centuries in their success in increasing their population was realistically depicted a hundred years ago by Abdullah bin Abdulkadir Munsyi in his book Hikayat Abdullah, written about the Opium Wars:

  

There is nobody among all the peoples of this region who believes the British can oppose the Chinese. The incredible thing is how every Chinese who hears that the British want to strike out the Chinese just laughs hysterically: the British are mad, even if a thousand ships bring them here. There is no reason even for the Chinese to resist. If all the Chinese just sit down and surrender themselves to be killed by the British, they will still not be wiped out even after ten years! And so many of those other well-off and good people say also: just let the Chinese all urinate at once and they will drown all of Britain.

  

If we return to the Chinese in Indonesia who, before the revolution were able to increase their population by 52% over a ten-year period, and then we remember also that there were very few Chinese female singkeh who came to Indonesia, we can conclude that the Chinese in Indonesia, especially those in Java, have more than 50% native blood. So they are in fact native Indonesians who practice Chinese traditions and customs. They would be more properly described as an Indonesian minority that practices foreign traditions rather than with the legal term of Chinese.

  

As a minority that mixes every day with local people and which is spread out all over the country among the native peoples, they have a sizeable knowledge and an understanding of the native peoples. Using this knowledge, and also given their practice of maintaining concubines and their patriarchal family system, they have quickly multiplied and spread out even to the most isolated places.

  

Hs-y, I have tried to explain to you how there is a group of Indonesians that, for whatever reason, wants to get rid of all Chinese from Indonesia. Without understanding these basic aspects of the issue, it is truly easy for somebody to slide into taking reprehensible actions. And if we do not also understand the changes that occurred after 1908 with the beginning of modern education, we can be even more easily misled. So I will try to explain the developments after 1908.

  

The Position of the Chinese Population after 1908

  

I use 1908 as the turning point because this was the year that the first Hollandsch Chineesche Scholen [Dutch-Chinese School] was opened. This school was opened following a resolution of the 28 October 1906 Congress that asked that Chinese children be accepted into government schools with the same fees as Europeans. This request was passed on to Governor General J.B. van Heutz in a meeting with Phoa Keng Hek⁵. This event provided a new orientation for the Chinese, tearing them away from the centuries-old traditions and customs and bringing them closer to the West. Changes among the Chinese began early in the century as an extension of the movements occurring in China itself. In China, this moment began with a revolution in education, using teaching methods from Japan, but adjusted to the needs of Chinese children. Japan had taken its system from the European lower school system. In Indonesia, the education of Chinese children was of no concern to the East Indies government, so the Chinese established the Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan in 1900 to work for the education of their own children. This association soon spread throughout Indonesia. It established schools using the public primary school curriculum but books taken from the European-Japanese system. Changes in the family system, and, therefore, in attitudes to the question of population growth, soon became manifest on the form of schools for girls. Another important change was the introduction of classes in official Chinese (Mandarin), which began to reduce the role of the regional dialects, which had so far been an obstacle to the unification of the Chinese. This wave of renewal was deemed important also among the adults. Courses in Mandarin, even evening courses for traders, were opened and were very popular everywhere.

  

In just a few years the Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan established many schools with thousands of students and hundreds of teachers, most of whom were brought from China. Some had even studied in America. According to statistics from some of the years between 1910 and 1920, there were 442 private Chinese schools in the Dutch Indies, with 19,636 students and 858 teachers, the majority of whom were from China. The attention the Chinese paid to this issue of education was proven correct with repeated visits from commissioners of the Ministry of Education (Hsueh Pu) to report on developments.

  

But, in accordance with the conservative religion of seed-oriented views of Sun Yat-sen, the Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan also tried to improve knowledge of Chinese customs and traditions, based on the ethics of Confucius.

  

But unlike the native peoples, the Chinese, especially before 1908 and before the Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan, had to find their own road to obtain an education. Tio Ie Soei explained in his book Lie Kim Hok:

  

Clause 128 of Government Regulation 1854, which gave the Governor General authority to establish schools for children in the country, was deemed not to apply to Chinese, so that they could not be accepted in either the schools for Europeans or Natives.

  

There were also private village schools that were opened by European pensioners or ex-soldiers. There were regulations limiting the number of students they could enrol, but these regulations were rarely implemented, and the schools took in as many students as they could.

  

It was then the missions that took the initiative, as he also explained:

  

The first Mission School in Cianjur appeared to make progress. It started with just a few students, Sundanese and Chinese, the majority Chinese, then it increased to having 60 students (1868), all boys...

  

Compare this with R.A. Kartini, who was already writing in Dutch at the end of the nineteenth century, because there was a tradition of speaking Dutch in the family. Prince Ario Tjondronegoro, the bupati [district ruler or regent] of Demak, the grandfather of R.A. Kartini (Kartini was born in 1879) was the first bupati, perhaps the first Indonesian, to give his sons a Western education. As of 1846, even the Indies government had no plans to provide an education for native children, and even the schools for Europeans had many weaknesses.

  

So it was through a combination of Western-oriented education provided by missions and traditional schooling from their own homes that the overhaul and renewal took place, a renewal that in the end we have to describe as conservative. And it was precisely this conservatism that the Dutch Indies government feared because the Chinese were looking more to China and were turning their backs on the Dutch Indies government. Hurriedly, Governor General J.B. van Heutz ordered the establishment of Hollandsch Chineesche Scholen, with Dutch as the language of instruction and using the curriculum and teaching approach of the European primary schools (Europeesche Lagere Scholen). The teachers were drawn from the European public service. If you remember from my fourth letter to you, I mentioned how Fromberg called the Chinese the unacknowledged stepchildren of the Dutch Indies government. Now, in 1908, with this new regulation, the government finally recognised the Chinese as subjects and part of the people of the Dutch Indies. And from then on, Chinese who wanted a Western education could enrol in the European public schools.

  

The next step in limiting the extent to which they looked to China was to limit the role of the Chinese government in the education and commerce of the Chinese in Indonesia. In 1910, the government issued Regulation No. IS 296/1910, which made all Chinese who were born in the territory of the Dutch Indies Dutch subjects. With this regulation, all peranakan Chinese and Chinese born in Indonesia from a singkeh father became Dutch subjects no matter the nationality of their parents. The territory of the Dutch Indies became the defining criteria for determining their status as Dutch subjects. In 1911, there was also an agreement signed with the Chinese consuls in the Dutch Indies that restricted them to overseeing only the affairs of singkeh Chinese and not of those who would now be considered Dutch subjects. Before the agreement was signed, the Chinese government in Beijing had issued a law that all Chinese, even if they were born overseas, would retain Chinese citizenship. In the agreement signed on 8 May 1911, it was agreed that the issue of dual citizenship would be determined according to the colonial laws.

  

With the emancipation that had begun among the Chinese, a range of new problems and issues emerged. For example, in civil law there were contradictions with the traditions of the patriarchal family system.

  

Slowly but steadily some Chinese adopted new practices so that eventually only their names remained as a symbol of their Chineseness, as they no longer practiced traditional Chinese customs. Such people, having abandoned the customs that used to define them as Chinese, had in fact become new natives (pribumi). The fact that these people still occupied a middle layer in society did not make them any less pribumi.

  

The number of these people grew steadily. The number of them that became Christians also points to loosening the grip of traditional customs among them. There were 12,185 Chinese baptised as Protestants by the end of 1935. There were 30 people pioneering the spread of Protestant Christianity, 36 lay workers in the Protestant churches, 3 helping in religious schools, and 52 men and 36 women were teaching in religious schools. It is a pity that I do not have figures for those who became Catholics.

  

Hs-y, perhaps you are surprised that I am presenting you with this information. But I think it is necessary. 1908 saw the beginning of a new sociological branch in the Chinese population in Indonesia. This branch moved further and further away from the mainstream Chinese community, which tended to retain their traditions. The fundamental feature of this branch was that gradually their ties to their family and clan diminished, weakened and then disappeared. And it is clear that this trend also became a national issue for the Chinese, if we heed the arguments presented by Sun Yat-sen in San Min Chu I as an assessment of key national issues.

  

In that book, Sun Yat-sen proposed that the loyalty to clan, family and ethnicity, something which had preserved and developed Chinese culture in the past, be made the basis of Chinese nationalism. Was this really possible? I do not know. I do not know either, what are the short- or long-term plans to implement this idea. And I also do not know whether there has even been any attempt to implement it. Yet in the Chiang Kai-shek regime, this loyalty did not become the basis for nationalism but rather, the basis for a strengthening of the patriarchal character of the rulers. This was also the result of an indigestive contact with the West. And this took developments even further away from a healthy nationalism. Loyalty to country weakened. It was loyalty to the rulers that flourished. Aided by modern equipment, this became very clear. So it should be no surprise that in a situation of political impotence, Chiang Kai-shek ended up relying on the warlords, who represented forces of patriarchal traditionalism and had been left behind by modernity.

  

Excuse me for talking about these facts of the Chiang Kai-shek era. Obviously things were different among the progressive Chinese people. The victory of the Chinese people has also been a victory of loyalty to country over loyalty to clan. People now relate to country, and not to family and clan. Then the newspaper Nusantara, one of the drumbeaters for anti-Chinese hatred, reproduced an article from somebody across the Atlantic lamenting this change, condemning, refusing to accept, and cursing this kind of change, this new loyalty to country. The article carried the sensational title ‘The Crushing of Family Ties’. The writer wanted the restoration of the oppression of the patriarch: Loyalty should be for the patriarch alone. The country was to receive nothing; it was to be surrendered to imperialism. So behind the times!

  

Hs-y, I think I have drifted off to another topic. I began to explain the emergence of a new branch in the Chinese population here. It has been the origin of many other sub-branches that developed later. There were those who, because of their education, joined the Dutch or justified the Dutch rule. There were those who supported the independence struggle. There were those who gave body and soul to the struggle. There were those who became scholars, blank scholars who took no stand on issues. There were those who became professionals, bankers, and so on. In short, it was the beginning of the modern era. And if I call this trend a branch, then the main trunk that gave birth to it remained intact, until today. Even as modern education has expanded, the legacy of ancient times will not adjust to the modern world so easily.

  

A New Migration

  

Hs-y, do not be bored because I am about to talk about another migration wave, even though I will not really blame you. I am bored too. But even so, we must discuss this issue properly. This was not a primitive migration but, rather, the result of imperialism running amok and churning up the lives of the peoples of Asia and Africa last century and, most especially, churning up the lives of the people of China. I say ‘most especially’ because the Chinese people were suffering so many different degrees of oppression. First, because of the patriarchal family system, every member of the family lived under the oppression, in most cases, of the patriarch. Then as individuals they were exploited by both the national and international bourgeoisie and by feudalism. Third, there is the barrenness of the land which cannot provide them with life without a real input from modern science, which is only possible now in this century. And it seems that the colonialist and imperialist interference in China was also related to what they were doing in Indonesia.

  

Last century, at the same time the Chinese people were having every ounce of sweat squeezed out of them, some individuals, on their own initiative, began to clear jungle in Sumatra to establish plantations. Sumatra was sparsely populated at the time, and the native inhabitants were relatively prosperous and were unlikely to turn themselves voluntarily into plantation coolies. These entrepreneurs, white Europeans supported by their government as part of the propping up enterprises in the wake of the abolition of the Culture System⁶, started to take Chinese coolies from Singapore. I use the term ‘take’ to include kidnapping, theft, exploitation of the poverty of the coolie, and so on. After it became harder to find such coolies in Singapore, they began to buy them in Hong Kong, Macao and Canton. So a new migration of Chinese from overseas began.

  

This migration, based on deceit and exploitation as it was, increased after several new developments occurred among the various small plantation owners. The story is something like the following.

  

These small plantations were not profitable. There were no plantation companies at that time. In the 1870s, the Dutch started to look to the British colony of India and saw the success of the plantation companies. The Dutch salivated at the sight of their huge profits. So soon afterwards, both in the Netherlands and in Indonesia, new plantation companies were established. In a very short time forty-six such companies were established. Mr. N.P. van den Berg, the former president of the Javasche Bank, became the main proponent of this development. Ten years before van den Berg started campaigning, the capitalists had begun the effort while importing the Chinese labour I talked about earlier. It was not until 1872 that coolies from Java were brought in. So there were two kinds of coolies born with two different names. The singkeh, or new workers, were the Chinese coolies, and then there were the laukeh, or old coolies, namely the Javanese. In 1870, the Deli Maatschappij was formed in Amsterdam; five years later there came the Deli-Batavia Maatschappij, to be followed by still more companies reflecting the profits to be made from human labour and the earth. By 1915, there were 1,148 such companies, with their head offices in both the Netherlands and Indonesia. They had the total capital of 673,456,300 guilders.

  

Just imagine: 1,148 companies, each importing, say, 100 Chinese coolies, so that at least 114,800 people would have been brought in! And this is if we calculate just on the basis of 100 per company and if we count only those working. How many more were killed, hung, ran away, died of illness, went home after their contracts ended and so had to be replaced? How greedily did the companies swallow up these Chinese human beings!

  

In my sixth letter, I told you how between 1888 and 1931 these companies swallowed 356,000 Chinese coolies. And so this is the figure that we can estimate.

  

These migrations decreased after 1928, when the Dutch Indies government began to worry about the population growth in Java, which was spurred on by increased prosperity, according to Lekkerkerker. More and more laukeh were brought to Sumatra, and so there were fewer and fewer singkeh. The increase in laukeh coming to Sumatra was also helped by improvements in the working conditions and legal status for coolies. As you know, Hs-y, the conditions for the coolies were terrible. Tens of thousands disappeared without a trace. It was hell for them! And these terrible conditions were legalised by the 1880 Coolie Ordinance⁷, which provided legal sanctions for those who did not keep to their contracts. What did a contract mean to an impoverished, illiterate farmer living in sub-standard social conditions? The implementation of the punishment under these contracts was handed to vicious reptiles of foremen who would meet out the most inhumane punishments for the smallest infractions. This often resulted in coolies being bonded for life or, as happened not infrequently, they would even lose their lives. The story of the Temple of the Five Ancestors is a reminder to us all of that.

  

And so that was how things were through to 1931. (How many years passed by? How many billions of guilders did they suck out? How many litres of tears and blood had flowed?) It was only then that the Dutch implemented the improvements in working conditions for the coolies. And, Hs-y, do not think that they did this out of the goodness of their Dutch hearts. No, the problem was that it was becoming difficult to obtain labour. The plantations were becoming well known as hellholes. I still remember how, as children, we would all hide every time a car passed. It was a common belief, indeed common knowledge, that these cars were driven by the Dutch masters who kidnapped coolies. These inhumane kidnappings, justified by the law (with forced thumb-printing of contracts), were happening all the time and everywhere. Such was the great need for coolies, and such, too, was the difficulty in obtaining them. The tobacco plantations in Deli were threatened with a collapse in production. The Dutch tobacco world, dependent on the demand from America, was under a cloud. So after some thought, no doubt, they made the improvements to the 1880 Coolie Ordinance in order to try to save this situation.

  

The more laukeh arrived, the fewer singkeh there were. You can get the number of Chinese who were later replaced by Javanese from some of the statistics. Based on these figures, I cannot really believe that there were only 356,000 Chinese coolies brought to the plantations between the years 1888 and 1931. I think there must have been more than one million! The 1930 census showed that Javanese coolies who did not wish to return home accounted for 40% of the population of East Sumatra, 54% of the Langkat region, 60% of Deli and Serdang, 36% of Simelungun and Karo, and 46% of the Asahan inhabitants. Figures from 1934, after the decline in the migrations, still show their large numbers. These figures are just for the tobacco plantations [refer to the table below: Table of Number of Coolies in 1934].

  
  

So Chinese coolies were still the second largest group and, indeed, the largest on the plantations. The following table allows us to make this comparison across the whole of Indonesia [refer to the table below: Comparison of Javanese, Chinese and Other Coolies (1932)].

  
  

We can see from this table that even after the improvement in coolie working conditions, the Chinese coolies were pushed down only to second place. And this excludes the Chinese who laboured solely in the mines.

  

In 1905, in Bangka alone there were 43,000 Chinese in a population of 115,000. The remaining 71,000 were listed as Alien Asians and Natives. Noting how the Natives were listed last of all, we can conclude also that their presence was not considered to be significant. They were even looked upon simply as ‘Chinese with brown skin’, as one joke goes. Most of the Chinese were mine labourers. The same was the case on Belitung. Of its population of 58,000 at the end of 1915, 20,000 were Chinese. Most of these were also mine labourers. These mines had been worked by Chinese labour since 1717 until today. Between 1717 and 1720, they produced 2,500 pikuls⁸ every year. Between 1910/1911 and 1917/1918, they produced 1,937,466 pikuls every year. It is easy to see how much they contributed to producing all this, but it also helped increase their population. And this is only the data for the tin mines in Bangka!

  

The same story can be told for West Kalimantan and Riau, where the Chinese were not only traders and labourers but also free farmers. They farmed in the gambier gardens of Riau, in the pepper fields of Bangka, and so on.

  

Hs-y, these waves of Chinese migration were connected to the victories of colonialism, imperialism and international capitalism. Indonesian nationalism, which had not yet or had only just been born, was not yet in control and had not yet obtained its victory. The Chinese migrations to Indonesia had nothing to do with Chinese imperialism. The Chinese themselves were also victims of imperialism.

  

Illegal Populations

  

With the declining social conditions in China occurring at the same time as the restrictions on Chinese entering Indonesia were increasing, there must have been those who entered the country illegally. They would have had the same aim: a better life. In those areas of Indonesia where there is only a sparse population, where there is still much virgin land, where the coast is unpatrolled, such as in Kalimantan, we can expect that there was a large illegal population.

  

I do not know much about this subject, so I will not dwell on it any further.

  

Do Not Belittle the Role of the Chinese Worker in the Indonesian Economy

  

The Chinese and Javanese population growth outside of Java continued in competition after the revisions of the 1880 Coolie Ordinance. But this cannot take away from the contributions made by the Chinese on the plantations and the mines. Nor can their contribution be denied in the founding and developing of new towns. But the greatest contribution they made was bringing in foreign exchange.

  

The increase in the number of Javanese coolies was not caused by an anti-Chinese hate campaign but was the result of Dutch Indies government policy which took advantage of the needs of the plantations and mines to move people out of Java. This policy was successful in that one million people were moved to areas outside of Java. With this development, the migration of Chinese to plantations in Indonesia stopped.

  

But still, it is important not to belittle the role of Chinese labour in the Indonesia economy. This was admitted by Prime Minister Juanda when, as reported by Antara on 23 November 1959, he stated in Jogja that PP 10 does not apply to Chinese labour but only to the Chinese kiosks, shops and stalls. And what was the reaction of the Chinese workers who, alongside the Javanese, had given great service to the plantations outside Java?

  

Hs-y, I think this PP 10 provides them with an opportunity to improve their lot by returning to the PRC, because the living conditions for workers in Indonesia are still so low, no matter how we look at it. Then there is the head tax on foreigners that further ruins their lives. The Republik newspaper of 23 February 1960, reported:

  

Gradually over the last few years, about 40% of the Chinese in Bangka have returned to the PRC at their own expense. Now that the Chinese government is providing charter vessels to take people home at the government’s expense, almost all of the remaining 60% have registered to return home.

  

This 60% are coolies at the Bangka Tin Mine and are too poor to pay for a trip home.

  

And, Hs-y, the recent decline in the productivity of tin mining in Bangka is not due to its transfer into Indonesian hands. There has been a decline in the work morale there as a result of the disincentive of the head tax on foreigners. This has led to more people going back to China. In the meantime, it takes more than just one or two years to train new workers. Now that people can go home free, we can just imagine the damage that is going to be done to production and the injury that this will bring to both tin mining and sales. If within a year other countries can cut in on Indonesia, it will not be just a case of increasing production but also of overcoming real setbacks in trade.

  

Their Position as Retailers, Distributors, and So On

  

The position of the Chinese population in filling the function of retailers and distributors has not meant that they have been exploiters of Indonesian land and people. They are just filling a vacancy in the social system that for centuries was left unoccupied by Indonesians, before, during, and after Dutch colonisation. Even though they may not have had modern schooling, their knowledge of prices, value, the needs of the population, and the quantities involved cannot be ignored in the struggle for the prosperity and welfare of the people. The same applies to the knowledge of distributors about what goods are produced by the people and what is needed by the factories, both here and overseas. Perhaps people in the towns are a little concerned about this. But in the villages, where raw materials are produced and where so many goods are, in the end, consumed, these blows bring the worst suffering. The suffering caused by the suspension of this function can be illustrated with a story told to me by a Chinese who visited me in my house. He said:

  

In East Java everyone knows how hard it is for the sugar producers among the people because they use traditional methods of production. Before the implementation of PP 10, they could sell their sugar to a Chinese trader-distributor for Rp 200 per pikul. After the implementation of PP 10, the traders have refused to buy. They say, “If I buy, I will be arrested, you will be arrested, we will all be arrested.”

  

“So to whom should we sell then?” they ask.

  

“There, to the cooperative.”

  

And so they throng to the cooperative. They bargain, of course, but still only get Rp 75. They sign the receipts. But the money is never paid. All they have are receipts!

  

And this is just sugar, Hs-y. There are also pepper, soybeans and maize, and in all these, Indonesian farmers do not know much about quality even though they are experts in the types of crops. I can say this because I used to spend a lot of time with farmers, helping my mother trade with them. Of course, not all farmers are like the ones I knew, but those who know a lot about quality would themselves strive to get into trade if they had the capital and the courage.

  

And how many will suffer under this PP 10? I have written about this earlier. But to be sure that it is not forgotten, I will write about this again in my next letter.

  

Policy on Chinese Population must be Developed Wisely

  

The Chinese population clearly fills a not unimportant social function. It is the formal right of the government to issue PP 10. But to take a stupid action, then just wait for the consequences, and finally try to find a way out of the problems caused by one’s own actions is not a wise way of doing things. Again it is the right of the government to remove the small Chinese traders from the villages. But nobody has the right to create more difficulties for the masses of poor people, who produce the raw materials for the towns and the world market and are the last link in the chain of consumers for goods from outside their regions.

  

There are no proper grounds for offending the feelings of these people by making them ‘non-active’ in their social function. It is not proper to do this to citizens of a friendly country, nor to people who have made real contributions in the common struggle of the Indonesian people against colonialism and imperialism. They have also made valuable contributions to the advancement of Indonesian civilisation. Most of all, they should not be treated this way, as they are peaceful people who have no evil intent towards Indonesian national life.

  

It is clear that there is a group of people and a section of the press that want to remove them from Indonesian soil. But they have their own purpose, against which we should all be vigilant. And, Hs-y, I have no specific interest in defending the present demographics of the Chinese population here. Rather, I am struggling with this issue so that there is no harm done to either the Chinese community or the people themselves.

## The Economic Position of the Chinese: the Balance between Demographics and Production

  

Hs-y,

  

Now we arrive at the issue of the economic position of the Chinese. This is the issue that for centuries has been the source of so much envy among the national bourgeoisie and the imperialists. But I must apologise to you for daring to discuss economic issues when, in fact, I do not really know much about the ins and outs of the economy. But then it is not my intention to spread more myths about the economy either. I just want to describe to you their economic position in the context of their conflicts with other economic groupings in Indonesian society.

  

Before we go on to this subject, it is necessary first to present the relationship between the demographics of the Chinese population and their production activities. This will enable us to understand more precisely the situation of this community.

  

The results of the population census that was carried out between 22 September and 7 October 1937 can be found in the tables below [refer to the tables below: Population (1937)].

  
  

We can see from the table that the Chinese were the second largest group after the pribumi, comprising about one-sixtieth of the native population. If we present the figures concerning the activities and occupations of the Chinese, we get the figures [refer to the tables below: Occupations of the Chinese in Indonesia according to the 1930 Census]. From these figures we can see that the majority of Chinese were not traders, as is assumed by so many people. From the total of 1,233,856, only 264,562 were traders, 214,744 were farmers, and 45,596 were miners or owned their own small mining stakes. I do not think the other categories are significant in terms of economic power. If we look at another comparison, we see that it was the Chinese on Java and Madura who were stronger in trading, while it was mainly those in Sumatra who were farmers. From the point of view of analysing the issue of economic position, I want to limit my comments here to the role of the Chinese in Java and Madura. The pribumi were 98% of the population. Europeans and those given the same status were 0.5%, Chinese 1.4% and other Asians 0.1%. If we set out the relationship between demographic figures and occupations and activities statistics, we get Table: ‘Occupations of Inhabitants of Java and Madura according to the 1930 Census’ [refer to the tables below].

  
  
  

If we take just the figures on trade, we see that 6.3% of the pribumi, 57.66% of the Chinese, 14.15% of the Europeans and 72.65% of the East Asians were engaged in trade. But we also see that pribumi traders made up the largest group with 908,940 people, while there were 105,445 Chinese. The different kinds of trade are shown in Table: ‘Types of Trade and Number of Traders for Java and Madura (1930)’ [refer to the table below].

  
  

Categories 1-7 and 9 constitute small traders. The category ‘Small Mixed’ includes dealers in second-hand goods and all other kinds of odds and ends. The ‘Other’ category refers to the trade in jewellery, medicines, portraits, traditional medicines, and so on. ‘Large-scale and Distributor’ refers to export and import, contract purchase of produce, and so on.

  

Hs-y, some of these tables I have taken from Dr. Liem Twan Djie. In these cases, we should also note that small intermediate retail trade and small retail trade should also be put in the ‘Small Mixed’ category. Intermediate trade, in accordance with the usage of Dr. Liem Twan Djie, is the same as intermediate gatherers trade [buying directly from small producers and then reselling it wholesale] and small gatherers trade [buying directly from small producers and reselling it retail]. We can imagine that most of the pribumi were active as small traders while the Europeans, Chinese, and Asians were more involved in intermediate level trade. The 6,551 pribumi in Category 8 (‘Large and Medium Trade’) perhaps may have been mainly concentrated in small gathering trade. The 3,498 Europeans were almost all active in large-scale retail and wholesale trade (importers and exporters). The Chinese and East Asians, according to the 1892 and 1930 censuses, were almost all concentrated in the intermediate wholesale trade.

  

An official announcement in the Indisch Verslag of 1931 stated the following:

  

Intermediate trade in the Dutch Indies is almost wholly in the hands of Chinese... Besides the Chinese merchants there are some Arab intermediate traders. There are also several pribumi intermediate traders, usually with quite strong capital.

  

... Many pribumi who are active in intermediate trade play the role of Ali Baba to the Chinese traders who buy up the crops before harvest or to the export companies themselves. They buy up pre-harvest in small amounts from the farmers and then pass them on to the Chinese buyers or the export companies. Unlike with the intermediate trade, small trade is mainly in the hands of pribumi...

  

Hs-y, I have actually quoted too much from the book by Dr. Liem Twan Djie. But what can I do? In fact, I am going to quote from him again, this time material he took from the Handbook of the Netherlands East-Indies, published in 1930. Hence, this material may predate the publication of the census. However, Liem Twan Djie was of the view that there were no distortions in the material and that the situation as regards trade was the same after 1930 as before. This is the material he quoted from the Handbook:

  

Although in recent years also, Japanese and Chinese firms have applied themselves to the wholesale trade in the Netherlands East Indies, still the European and also American companies carry on business here for the greater part... Intermediate trade however (is) chiefly in hands of the Chinese, who form the link between the producer wholesale trade and the consumer retail trade. In a far smaller degree, the Arab acts as the intermediate trader... Both the established and the travelling retail trade are practically entirely in their (pribumi) hands, except in very large towns... The retail trade, as it is carried on in the native passars (markets) is almost entirely in hands of the native population. Practically native wholesale-trade does not exist in the Netherlands East Indies; at the very most there is an incidental intermediate trade.

  

So we can see from this data, quoted from the various experts, that the Chinese do have a strong economic position in Indonesia. In the current liberal economic system, neither the pribumi nor even earlier colonisation could displace them from this position. But anybody can also see that the Chinese did not use this position to hit out at the pribumi or colonisers. This is a fact that simply emphasises their peaceful nature.

  

How did the Chinese obtain this strong economic or commercial position? They won this position during the period of transition from control by the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) to that of direct rule by the Dutch government, namely, the Bataafsche Republiek (Batavian Republic).

  

The Fall of the VOC and the Consolidation of the Chinese Economic Position

  

In 1798 the government took over all property of the VOC. This happened as a result of the massive corruption in every branch of the VOC. Corrupt officials were taking home massive wealth, but the Netherlands itself was being impoverished. The VOC was disbanded in 1799, and the final balance sheet showed just how enormous the corruption was. There were liabilities of 126 million guilders as against only 10 million in assets. This ended the VOC monopoly on trade. The end of the monopoly meant there was a need for skills that had not previously been in demand. Previously all merchandise had been sent directly to Amsterdam on the assumption that eventually everything would sell with no risk of a loss, barring a warehouse fire or a ship sinking. As a metropolitan centre for every kind of commission and purchase in the Middle Ages, Amsterdam had raked in untold wealth until the corruption of the VOC robbed it of all its prosperity. In this period before the Bataafsche Republiek was able to bring recovery to the economy, there was only one real trader, namely, Anthony van Hoboken (according to W.M.F. Mansfelt in his book De Nederlandsche Handel-smaatschappij 1824-1924, Volume I). In any case, the French Revolution followed by Napoleon’s administration together destroyed Dutch trade and the Dutch economy. Additionally, the main source of wealth of the Netherlands, the Dutch Indies, was seized by Britain.

  

One setback caused another for Amsterdam as a metropolitan centre. Its population declined from 240,000 to 180,000 people. And there was another setback when one of the main sources of its lifeblood, the Ij canal, started to silt up at its mouth.

  

With the defeat of Napoleon, the British returned the Dutch Indies to the Netherlands. By that time, the Netherlands had no more money. Other countries were also pressing in on commerce in the Indies. Data from 1819, for example, show that only 43 of the 171 ships that visited the Dutch Indies coming from America and Europe were from the Netherlands. There were 62 British and 50 American ships. The Dutch were being challenged not only in the sphere of international trade but also in trade in Java. There were more English, Scottish and German merchants than Dutch. They admitted that it was the Chinese and other foreigners who had strong trading operations. As a result of the technical and industrial revolution, which had left the Dutch behind, the British were leading world trade.

  

The Chinese overseas trade was still limited to China itself and was mainly in tea. But even the tea trade was pried away from them once tea was planted in India and Indonesia in 1824. In 1825, with the establishment of the Nederlandsche Handels-maatschappij (NHM), the Dutch took over for themselves the trade in birds’ nest, spices and other goods previously plied by the Chinese junks. Even as the Dutch began the process of repairing the damage done to their economy and trade by the French Revolution and the Napoleonic rule, the Chinese met little competition, and so they began to consolidate their position in the domestic economy. The exception was in the area of large-scale trade and export and import. This had always been the monopoly of the white merchants, something made possible by the decline and defeat of the Chinese in shipbuilding and on the seas.

  

Efforts by the Dutch to win the tea trade away from the Chinese only boomeranged on them later. In its first effort in this business, the NHM suffered a loss of 900,000 guilders, or one third the value of the total product. Then the British reduced the tariffs in the ports that she controlled. This resulted in a decline in smuggling and a drop in prices. Then, to make things even worse, the tea barons in America dumped more tea at cheap prices in Europe. A request by the NHM to the Dutch king to end the tea trade with China was turned down on the grounds that it was unseemly to end such commerce just because of a loss. It turned out that the officials in Canton who were supposed to be gathering in the tea were playing fast and loose with quality. The Dutch king took action and dismissed the Dutch consul in Canton. In 1832-33, Dutch trade with China ended up with an outstanding loss of 1.7 million guilders out of an investment of 5-6 million guilders. A major reason was that, by that time, tea was being planted in India and Indonesia.

  

And so the Chinese were able to consolidate their position in domestic commerce, especially as small retailers and intermediate traders, until today and PP 10.

  

Comparison of the Per Capita Income between Chinese and Other Inhabitants

  

K.H. Tjikwan reported on the per capita income in his speech addressing the proposal made by Sutomo¹ and his friends. According to a report in Abadi, 30 January 1960, the 1927 statistics for Java (and Madura?) give the following picture.

  

The annual income from the three groupings was about 2.5 billion guilders. 1.5 billion came from the pribumi and their agricultural produce. 200 million guilders came from Europeans and the government-owned enterprises, and 800 million from privately owned companies. If we make a comparison on per capita income, we get (a) 3 guilders per European, (b) 1 guilder per Chinese, and (c) 0.03 guilder per pribumi.

  

I do not know how he calculated these per capita incomes. But let us accept these figures, although with the qualification that there is no mention of the role of the East Asians, especially the Japanese, who played an important role in the economy, especially in the retailing of cheap basic goods imported from Japan. We also have to note that the 0.03 guilder per capita income for pribumi is purely an abstract monetary statistic. We know that nobody could have lived off only 0.03 guilder. We know that the people did not live off this 0.03. This was used only for exchange with people outside their environment. They lived through barter with their neighbours and off the produce of their own gardens and fields – fruits, vegetables, herbs, and so on, which were consumed directly.

  

S.R. Ratnam, a Malayan journalist, wrote an article for the London daily Reynold News in November 1945, entitled ‘Typhoon in Asia’, to acquaint people with an awakening Indonesia. He wrote that Indonesia was a fertile former colony, half the size of India, with one-fifth the population, but where only 5% of the population had a per capita income of more than $13. But then Europeans, who were 0.5% of the population, were earning 65% of the income declared for tax purposes (Osman Raliby, Documenta Historica, Volume I). These figures are confusing due to their incomplete character.

  

As an extension of the ethical policy introduced by Dr. van Deventer at the end of the last century and reflecting a certain guilt in the Netherlands regarding Indonesia, the Dutch Indies government developed a kind of social ethical concern. This concern produced a commission to investigate the economic conditions of the people. By 1920 this investigation had produced 25 volumes of data. But unfortunately I have not had access to these.

  

It is true that the traditional income of the pribumi at this time, as well as before the time of the VOC, was very low. But still, it is not really wise to base calculations on state tax receipts. In any case, if we just talk about the income of the Chinese traders on Java and Madura, there is no doubt they had a higher income than pribumi. However, the Chinese workers in the mines, fields, plantations and fisheries outside Java were not earning any more than pribumi workers in the same areas. And these latter Chinese comprised 40% of their number throughout Indonesia before the revolution.

  

It is even more difficult to calculate the income of the Chinese. The traders are divided into so many different types of traders, whose enterprises differ so much from each other and which can differ so much in scale as well. Also the small and medium traders in the villages have never been obliged to keep accounts. The same applied, though, to the moneylenders, the traders who bought up forest and agricultural produce, and the small industries that were worked by pribumi, East Asians and Europeans as well.

  

In the small trade sector, the majority of activity was in the hands of pribumi, followed by the Chinese. In East and Central Java, this small trade was a primary source of income for people. But in West Java, it was a supplementary income. According to the analysis of Dr. E. de Vries and Dr. H. Cohen in their article ‘Enkele Beschouwingen over den Desa-kleinhandel op Java en Madura’, published in Koloniale Studien, Jaargang 1937, those for whom this trade was a primary source of income had a turnover on average of 27 cents per day, giving them an income of 25-30 guilders per year, or 9 cents per day. There were 100,000 pribumi in this category on Java and Madura and 50,000 Chinese.

  

So if we base ourselves on this rather unclear speech by Tjikwan, if the pribumi was earning 3 cents on average, the small traders (not including their families) were earning around 7 to 9 cents, or only 1 or 2 cents per capita. And these small traders would not have the same opportunities as pribumi to carry out barter, or to make extra money selling vegetables of one kind or another! So it is clear that the Chinese living in the villages were no better off than the pribumi, and perhaps even worse off.

  

Of course, those Chinese with large enterprises would have greater earnings. But we will discuss this in another section later.

  

Competition with the Chinese

  

a. Competition from the Chinese Themselves

  

This petty trade, conducted by both the pribumi and the Chinese, is not as easy as many outsiders who just see the profits might imagine.

  

Hs-y, after the 1870 Agrarian Law², which prohibited the Chinese from farming, many had to move to other endeavours, including petty trade, small-scale industry and handicrafts. A direct result of this law was a multiplying of the number of Chinese involved in petty trade. Djie Ting Liat, in his book De Economische positie der Chineezen of Java, described this new situation as: ...mushrooming Chinese shops, for which there is no economic necessity.

  

The explosion in the number of Chinese stalls and kiosks, which was not the result of economic dynamics, led to savage competition of one against the other. This led to a decline in the situation of petty trade in the villages without any impact on large-scale trade, especially not on the exporters and importers. This trouble was concentrated only at the level of the final consumer, where the number of consumers remained the same but the number of distributors increased.

  

Other competition developed as a result of the population increase among the Chinese. This was partly a result of the arrival of new migrants and partly a result of growth caused by the resilience of traditional outlook, which preferred a small-scale family-head businessman to a large-scale bachelor businessman. I have referred earlier to the book by Dr. Liem Twan Djie on this issue.

  

b. Competition from the Pribumi Bourgeoisie

  

The most fundamental competition arose as a result of the awakening of the Indonesian bourgeoisie, who started to become conscious of their situation and struggled to improve it. Because of this, like it or not, they established a front against all foreign businesses, no matter of what origin. This new consciousness was born in Lawian, near Surakarta, and a centre of the batik world. This consciousness emerged when Europeans began to bring more decorated cloth from Europe. The batik producers started to use new materials and chemicals so they could produce batik more quickly in order to compete with the imported European cloth. They also began using cap (metal stamps) to replace the traditional canting (wax pipe) used to make batik. But the flood of cloth from Europe, especially Britain, killed off the pribumi weaving production.

  

So producers then had to start buying the cloth for batik from intermediary merchants, most of whom were Chinese. The fate of batik become more and more dependent on imported materials, steadily provoking a hostile attitude among batik producers towards foreign merchants. With the formation of the Budi Utomo³ in 1908, the bourgeoisie felt that they would receive support in their struggle against foreign merchants. There then followed the various movements of the national bourgeoisie, such as the Islamic Merchants Union in Jakarta (1909) and the Islamic Trading Union (1911), founded in Bogor by Mas Tirto Adisurjo, who was also editor of the magazine Medan Prijaji. Then in Solo there arose the Islamic Trading Union as a branch of the Jakarta organisation, headed by the batik king, Haji Samanhudi. Tirto Adisurjo travelled everywhere carrying the message of the need for the pribumi bourgeoisie to struggle to advance their social economic situation. He published Sarutomo as the voice of the movement.

  

The strength of the movement was developed by mobilising religious sentiments. The movement was successful in uniting the bourgeoisie under a religious banner and also in reviving religious life, which had wilted during the previous period. In Solo, this movement had real strength. They carried out boycotts not only against the Chinese merchants but also the pribumi merchants who did not join the movement. There were small clashes here and there. In 1912, Haji Umar Said Tjokroaminoto, an employee in a European merchant house, founded the Sarekat Islam (Islamic Union). This was followed by unrest in Surabaya, mostly targeting the Chinese. At one point, the Chinese protested by closing all their shops, stalls and merchant houses. So that you understand a bit more about this organisation, I will quote from the Preamble to the Constitution:

  

It is common knowledge today that we are entering the age of progress. Our motto today must be: We must achieve progress as a reality; it must no longer just remain an unrealised ideal. All Muslims have a responsibility to help achieve this, and so because of this we have decided to form the Sarekat Islam. (translated [into Indonesian] from the Dutch)

  

The aims of the association were: (a) to develop a spirit of commerce, (b) to help members who are in difficulties, (c) to improve the spiritual and material development of the pribumi, and (d) to prevent misunderstandings of Islam and raise the religious life of the pribumi in accordance with Islamic law and custom. So, Hs-y, this was the movement of the national bourgeoisie at its beginning. It would be a mistake to think that this movement took a political position. At its first congress on 26 January 1913, in Surabaya, Haji Samanhudi was recognised as the founder of the Sarekat Islam [S.I.], and H.U.S. Tjokroaminoto was elected chairperson of the Leadership Council. In his speech at the opening of the congress, Tjokroaminoto explained that the association was going to struggle for the advancement of the people, and he went on to say:

  

... If we are oppressed, we must seek the aid of the Governor General. We are loyal to the Government, and we are satisfied to be subjects of the Dutch government. It is not true what some people are saying: that we want to cause trouble. It is not true that we want conflict. Whoever says or thinks that is mad. We do not want such a thing, a thousand times no! (Translated [into Indonesian] from the Dutch)

  

He also said that the S.I. was not a political party that wanted a revolution, as was thought by some people.

  

Hs-y, it is clear that in the beginning, the S.I. was a movement of the pribumi bourgeoisie seeking to improve its social and economic position, with Islam as its basis. And this movement, slowly but surely, ended up suppressing the position of the Chinese.

  

The position of the Chinese actually got worse during the period of the revolution in China. These troubles among the [PRC] Chinese were not reflected among the Chinese in Indonesia. But these troubles did impact very negatively on the Chinese in this situation of intensified competition.

  

c. Competition from the Europeans

  

Hs-y, this competition began with the Depression of 1929, coinciding with the increase in the number of pribumi intellectuals. Many Indo-Europeans⁴ lost their jobs in the civil service or the merchant houses. They went into trade and often received preference from the big European trading houses that dominated the economy.

  

d. Competition from the Japanese

  

Competition from the Japanese flowed from Japanese economic expansion into Southeast Asia as part of the preparation for its military and political domination of the region. The implantation of Japanese traders here as a fifth column was a very inexpensive exercise for the Japanese, as these traders could earn their own living through their trading. The Japanese advance was made possible by the outbreak of World War I and the resulting destruction of so many factories in Europe and the destruction of so much merchant shipping capacity. Japanese pricing policy also succeeded. They provided very cheap goods. They were of low quality but all the same, could still be used. This policy led to the widely held view in Indonesia that Japan was synonymous with cheap, low quality goods.

  

The tremendous extent of the Japanese offensive is shown in the following figures. Between 1903 and 1913, Japanese imports amounted to 1.25% of total imports. By 1925-29, this rose to 10.2%. During the Depression, when the purchasing power of people dropped, European and American goods could not compete with Japanese goods. In 1931, imports from Japan reached 16% of total imports and then in 1932 jumped to 21%, in 1933 to 31%, and in 1934 to 32%. This was reported by J.H. Boeke in his book Indische Economie.

  

Japanese set up shops in every town of ten thousand people or more to distribute goods from Japan. The number of Japanese shops established by 1933 can be seen in the figures in the following table. These are the figures noted by the Ministry for Overseas Japanese, as reported in Economisch Weekblad Voor Indonesie (1933) [refer to the table below: Development of Japanese Retail in Java].

  
  

The Squeeze on the Economic Position of the Chinese

  

Hs-y, everybody in Indonesia is witness to the patience and resilience of the Chinese in facing difficulties, even of the most fundamental kind. A systematic squeezing of the Chinese after 1910 came from two directions.

  

a. Pressure from the Cooperatives Movement

  

The cooperatives movement, which spread quickly, was a direct product of the emergence of the big and influential associations. In 1915, the Dutch Indies government issued IS No. 413, intended to develop a cooperatives movement based on the cooperatives system used in the Netherlands. Whatever the deficiencies of this regulation, the cooperatives steadily spread.

  

In 1931, the Dutch Indies state budget allocated funds to develop these cooperatives.

  

The political parties that emerged, especially the Indonesische Studieclub under the leadership of Dr. Sutomo in Surabaya, also supported this movement, especially in East Java. Although these cooperatives began with members made up only of workers and employees, they eventually spread to the people as well.

  

By 1933, there were 1,504 cooperatives, including 822 consumer cooperatives, 30 credit cooperatives, 340 savings and loan cooperatives, 28 mutual help cooperatives and 271 cooperatives whose purpose was unclear. These statistics are very incomplete if we remember that many cooperatives were not registered. According to the Indisch Verslag [Indies Gazette], 1932, the total number of unregistered cooperatives in Java and Madura were as set out in Table: Type and Number of Cooperatives (1931) [refer to the tables below].

  
  

But more important than the number of cooperatives was the increase in capital owned by cooperatives, as reported in the Indisch Verslag, 1939 [refer to the table below: Cooperative Capital (1939)].

  
  

According to the Indisch Verslag, 1939, by September 1938, mori [a kind of bleached plain linen] worth 542,650 guilders and batik and celup materials worth 23,815 guilders (a total of 566,465 guilders) were bought directly from importers for the use of the 108 batik enterprises that were members of cooperatives in Solo. And it was estimated that money in circulation among cooperatives in 1938 was three quarters of a million guilders.

  

b. Being Squeezed from Above

  

This happened during the Depression. Because there was a decline in imports and the purchasing power of the people dropped, the importers – traditionally whites – tried to cut out the Chinese by selling directly to the consumer. The purpose of this policy was to ensure continued circulation of money. Oei Tjong Hauw⁵, in an interview with a journalist from De Locomotief (1931), said that the importers were starting to take on the role of retailers. They sent peddlers out with trucks to deal directly with the farmers. Even in the sugar mills and among ordinary people, the Chinese retailers found themselves facing competition from their own suppliers.

  

And then with the Japanese occupation, along with the pribumi traders, they suffered another major and very rapid decline in commerce. During the revolution, there was no respite, except for those in the big cities occupied by the enemy, where trade grew rapidly as a result of the need to meet the demand for imported goods from the Allies and the Dutch.

  

Their Position after the Revolution

  

During the revolution, there arose the view that the only worthwhile activity was the armed struggle.

  

Trade and traders were seen as worthless, even looked down upon and insulted. This was especially true in regard to the attitude towards those who hoarded scarce goods. Among the extremist revolutionaries, these people were considered worse than even traitors, and could not be forgiven. It would not have been surprising if they were treated roughly, or if they sometimes suffered theft and then found they had no place to seek justice.

  

This general attitude, which also contributed to the general problem faced by such traders regardless of nationality or grouping, only helped worsen economic conditions and hold back progress towards prosperity. This has had a deep impact on social life but has never been properly discussed. It was as if the armed struggle would settle every issue, as if it were some kind of magic wand.

  

So when the revolution was over, these general views still held sway, and pribumi commerce remained very minor. It was true that in some cities, civil servants who had refused to work for the occupation forces had turned to trade. But as soon as the occupation forces left, they sought their old positions again. Republican civil servants had also turned to trade when they had been forced to flee, or for whatever reason. But they also sought to return to their original positions as soon as possible.

  

In the history of Indonesia, there was never a time when the pribumi completely abandoned commerce and when commerce had, therefore, been taken over by the Chinese. At that time, too, we should note that the problem of dual citizenship had not become an issue. The increase then in Chinese trade greatly upset those veterans of the revolution who found themselves with no position of power, no social function – partly as a result of the revolution not having harnessed all its potential in an efficient and effective way. Many of them have blindly thrown themselves into commerce despite having no capital. With their ambition also to obtain a share in political power, they then add political adventurism to their business adventurism. This combination aptly channels their remnant revolutionary zeal. It is true that they are not all like that, Hs-y, but I am just drawing the general line of things.

  

Based on this adventurism, they have joined with big Chinese capital. This cooperation is then justified by the ruling politicians with talk about the need to nationalise the economy. At the same time, certain parties are using this situation to collect as much money as they can for the purpose of financing their efforts to gain total power. They seek to plunder all the money they can from society by selling, often irresponsibly, all sorts of government business licenses. These businesses are then actually carried out by Chinese, or the licenses are re-sold. So every person standing on Indonesian earth is forced to pay for this adventurism and for the hunger for power of these various parties. Society is made to pay for the process of the party system evolving towards the dictatorship of the parties. Of course, in this struggle, there are those parties who, neither in their outlook nor practice, condone this plunder of the pockets of the people, but rather, wish to raise the understanding of the people of their living situation and social conditions. Such a party or parties would not be involved in this kind of adventurism.

  

Hs-y, this has been the situation since the end of the armed revolution. The situation is a mess and shows no promise for the future. At the beginning, people paid little heed to these developments or were not in a position to do anything about them. But as the situation worsened, it is becoming clear that the people are becoming poorer and poorer as a result. The people not only have to finance the livelihood of the traders, whatever their nationality, but also of these adventurers. To tell you the truth, I am not sure whether we can even call this situation real commerce. But anyway, let us leave this problem behind.

  

The value of money declines daily. The workers’ movement is demanding higher wages, without there being any modernisation of the productive apparatus on any front. The costs of exploitation continue to increase and to multiply, while the value of money declines. The result is a further decline in exports, except in oil and for a few giant corporations that have been able to continue to modernise their production. The position of Indonesia in the world market has also suffered setbacks because of the decline in its output.

  

Meanwhile these adventurer-trader-politicians, who have accumulated their money by cooperating with the Chinese or because they have been given special facilities by their parties, have now formed a front aimed at dislodging the Chinese from their position, in order to capture the Indonesian economy as the sole player.

  

Hs-y, I hope I am wrong because I am afraid of what it means if I am right. But for the moment, my analysis still holds. As far as I can see, the Indonesian bourgeoisie-in-the-making, which is shouting all the time about the national economy, is only out to gain control over the Indonesian economy for itself. Given that this is now a matter of self-interest and not national interest for them, we can understand why their efforts have become so emotional, ruthless and enthusiastic.

  

So this is the situation. And now comes PP 10.

  

But How Much Capital do the Chinese Really Have?

  

As I write this today, nobody can tell me how much capital is actually in the hands of the Chinese in Indonesia. Nobody has been able to do this for the large, medium or small traders, or for the village petty trader. But we can get some picture of the comparison between capital in the hands of the Chinese and the pribumi by looking at this summary prepared by the Regional Government Council for the Level Two Region of Bandung [see Table 14 below]. But we must be careful in using this data and applying it to other parts of Indonesia. And it cannot be applied at all to West Sumatra. The same applies for areas where the Chinese are in the majority.

  

Please look at the summary [refer to the tables below: Summary of Companies and the Size of their Capital in Bandung District].

  
  

It is to be regretted also that the production of this summary, which would have taken so much time and work, does not have the comprehensive categories that are required.

  

Whatever the deficiencies of this summary, we can still obtain some benefit from it. We can compare the number of companies and size of capital between foreign and non-foreign enterprises, namely, Foreign Enterprise Capital, Disguised or Semi-Disguised Capital, and Capital of Indonesian Citizens.

  

Under the heading ‘Type B’, we find the sub-heading B (II), explained as ‘Enterprises owned by Indonesian Citizens’, while sub-heading B (III) is ‘National Enterprises with no Foreign Capital’. These explanations are an unexplained puzzle. Perhaps with B (II), they mean enterprises of Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent. Then what exactly is meant by ‘national enterprises’ in B (III)? Must we interpret it as meaning companies owned by Indonesian citizens of indigenous descent? If this is the case, then once again, we find an example of economic discrimination and a definition of ‘national’, neither of which is appropriate in these times.

  

When we talk of national capital, we should be talking about all capital operating on Indonesian soil that is subject to the power of the national government. And if we talk about a national enterprise, we should be talking about an enterprise that is integral to the functioning of the national economy. There is a tendency for people to use the term ‘national enterprise’ in a way similar to that used to refer to companies by Indonesian citizens. Some companies that are referred to as national might not deserve that name because they do not contribute to production or distribution, and may even be subverting the economy. Such companies are better referred to as ‘anational’. But this is not so important.

  

Hs-y, the virtually useless summary line [i.e., the total figures at the bottom of the table] also makes a strange comparison. These figures indicate the insignificance of these national companies and explain why, in such a squeezed position in terms of capitalisation as well as a bourgeois force, they are eyeing the Rp 89,987,834.55 capital which they think they might be able to displace through some political move. They cannot displace this capital through commercial activity itself; in fact, they could even be swallowed up by it.

  

In the comparison above, we can also see the second type of capital, that referred to as ‘Ali Baba’ capital, where the capital is foreign but formally it is a pribumi business. Usually it is also the foreign party that runs the business with the pribumi simply renting the use of his name for formal purposes. So the people involved in these set-ups are people with some political position, that is to say, they have connections with influential political parties wielding power at the time. The social consequence of this is that the pribumi obtain financial benefit without doing any work or expending any energy or contributing any ideas. This makes no contribution to the development of their own character, eliminates the belief in the benefit of work, and brings about a moral decline, taking them into the abyss of humiliation. This practice also avoids any social responsibility. It combines foreign elements that wish to avoid paying tax with pribumi elements who want to turn a profit without having to work. I call them elements that do not wish to pay tax, because it is the pribumi who formally owns the business who must pay all taxes. In the end, the foreign elements end up making no payments to the state, which is very asocial behaviour. The adventurer-trader-politicians become increasing enmeshed in greed. Eventually conflicts emerge between the Ali and the Baba elements. The Ali elements, who have a strong political position (meaning: have good contacts with those in power) and a strong legal position, start to realise that they can control all this capital.

  

The atmosphere regarding international political issues is coloured by the campaign by the progressive workers’ movement to expel Dutch monopoly capital; there is also the American campaign against the PRC – an essentially emotional campaign, remembering that if China disappears, then America will lose its biggest market. Then with the increase of anti-communist activity everywhere, the Alis – devoid of all social norms and motivated only by their lust to control all the capital of the Babas – can mobilise their party friends to wrest the Chinese away from their capital!

  

Hs-y, this whole current campaign is about nothing except wresting capital away from the Chinese!

  

So you can understand why so many party leaders and figures intervene in these kinds of issues. We know that all this has been initiated by these adventurer-businessmen-politicians, who have obtained no role after the revolution and who have suffered moral decay. So we can also be sure that none of what they are doing, even if they succeed in wresting away the capital of the Chinese traders, will bring any prosperity to the people. They are only concerned about themselves and have no concern about their responsibility to society, despite all their talk about the national economy.

  

The depth of the Alis’ lust is shown by the viciousness of their campaign. And the stupidity of the campaign is reflected in the absence of any scientific knowledge and in the ignorance about the minority in their own society. This campaign, manifested in PP 10, is just one of many stupidities we have implemented. And the degeneration in moral character has gone so far now that people no longer want to deal with the reality that, in the end, we will all have to pay for these sins. And if we are still too poor to pay for these mistakes, then our grandchildren will have to pay.

  

It is no surprise if, from time to time, people start beating the drum and calling out that we must return to our national character! It is only Indonesians who do this! By Indonesians, I mean the ruling class, the official class. These campaigns are just a reflection of the absence of character of these rulers. They do not realise that the Indonesian people, despite all the waves of colonisation, are just as they have always been. They still contribute their paddy [harvested rice] to society, all their energies, all their body and soul, their lives and their happiness. The rulers make this wrong call, driven by the cries of their own conscience.

  

The PP 10 campaign provides no benefit to anybody, not to the Chinese, not to the national economy. Nobody can show any proof of such benefit, whether in the short term or in the long term. It is for this reason that the people who have launched this campaign are now all silent, hoping that they will never be held accountable for what they have done. They are busy looking for other campaigns to cover up their own failures. But the pen of history will not stop taking notes. The creators of this tragedy for a minority within society will not be able to hide their faces once it becomes clear that the people are not supporting these brilliant, glorious policies of theirs. The only ones receiving any benefit are those drunk on both the publicity they get overseas and the emotional policies of the United States.

  

So, Hs-y, I have now explained my opinions.

  

Now you know my views! And I am not the only one who holds these views.

  

To those going home to the PRC, leaving this meaningless tragedy here, I not only say goodbye but also wish them well. They have chosen a country where work is valued, where work is the basis of morality, and where character is formed through work and not via the stage and the radio, the parade and the show.

  

The Indonesian people, who live their lives stooped under the burden of work, are in sympathy with all countries where work is so valued and not, on the contrary, the source of humiliation and misery, impoverishment, disease and hunger.

  

Let us shake hands here. We will not forget anything that has happened in our lives, and we will pass on our notes to our descendents, to history.

## Letter Nine

  

## Some Conclusions

  

Hs-y,

  

It does not feel right having this long conversation with you without drawing some conclusions and making some proposals from all this.

  

Forgive me if all my chatter has bored you, taken up your time, or has not been at all interesting to you. But, in any case, I cannot remain silent in the face of events that I cannot at all support. I must speak out, and as it happens, you are the person I have chosen to listen to me. Once more, please forgive me.

  

With this ninth letter of mine, our conversation has reached its last chapter. But please do not misunderstand the situation. This matter is not yet at an end. This whole uproar about the Chinese is just the beginning of a social and sociological process in Indonesia. What will happen in the future? Who knows except the intellectual participants themselves? Those who are moving the events? Whether they are official movers or unofficial is not important. The important things are the events themselves, the reality, the facts. But we cannot let a process that violates values of humanity go unopposed. We must step forward and state that everything that violates humanity is barbaric. And because human beings embody a humanist and humane spirit, a human being without such a spirit is at best, only half-human. The other half is beast. It is no wonder then, that our ancestors carved statues of half-men/half-beasts. They were already acquainted with this phenomenon of a half-man/half-beast, as well as with humans themselves, and angels, and those beings that are half-gods.

  

Perhaps a half-human policy can proceed successfully for a while. Perhaps. But this success will not be a success for the people, because no matter in what country, the people never hold feelings of enmity towards other peoples or other countries. People everywhere are the loyal servants of humanity; it is they who sustain humankind itself in its life on this earth. We must evaluate every political move by the big shots and officials as to whether it will benefit the people or whether it is just some pretence that will be of no benefit to the people. Of course, they will say it will benefit the people; they would not dare implement any move without making such a claim!

  

Hs-y, you can see that I evaluate every aspect of this uproar over the Chinese from the point of view of the interests of the people, because I am a part of the people and not a part of the ruling class or the class of officials and big shots.

  

It will be easier for you to understand the comments that follow once you know my stand on this.

  

I will present to you the conclusions and proposals that follow from everything we have discussed. Without these, I think all our discussions will have been useless. And we live now in the modern era: Discard everything that is of no use and mobilise everything that is useful wherever we find it. Right?

  

Let us begin.

  

Conclusions and Proposals about Social-Historical Issues

  

Our social-historical material about the Chinese in Indonesia is not complete. Many of the Chinese associations in Indonesia publish all kinds of commemorative publications, usually about their organisations. These publications have never been collected, studied and analysed in a scientific way. As a result, whenever we discuss the Chinese in Indonesia, either foreign residents or Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent (or Waniktio – Warganegara Indonesia Keturunan Tionghoa), we are in the dark and can only grope around.

  

It is on this very insufficient basis that we have built our understanding with all its flaws. The racialists, who are aware of these limitations in our knowledge, take the opportunity to spread lies and slander against the Chinese. In order that this bitter experience is not repeated, when in fact it is completely unnecessary and indeed only creates these social oppressions, the Chinese must become aware of their duty to complete all this documentation. But they also must get this documentation out to the public, especially to the individuals who need it, either because of their work or for scholarly purposes.

  

There should be an effort to collect and reprint in their original form all the earlier material and to have it widely circulated. Such efforts should not be restricted to materials dealing with organisational life.

  

A history must be written as soon as possible so that there is no more confusion in the approach taken by the Hoakiau [overseas Chinese] or Waniktio [Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent] towards the Indonesian people or vice-versa. If there were such a history, people would become more familiar with each other, more acquainted and all kinds of social barriers would disappear.

  

That we do not have these social-historical materials is a social barrier in itself, beyond which is no man’s land. So the adventurers enter this area and appoint themselves as the supreme rulers and then practice their brinkmanship of the kind created by the late Foster Dulles¹.

  

Hs-y! Are you listening? Very well then, let us get started.

  

Conclusions about Cooperation between the Indonesian People and the Chinese

  

Every people and nation needs the friendship and cooperation of other peoples wherever they are. No people in this modern era can survive without the aid and cooperation of other peoples. It is very true that every nation must defend its national interest. But this does not mean that we must all return to the Middle Ages and try to live in autonomous societies. That is the dream of economists who are at a dead-end. Protecting domestic production in all its forms does not mean rejecting cooperation and friendship.

  

This land has so much space and can provide so much wealth for each person over the next few centuries. There is no need for any Indonesian to be pessimistic about having enough rice to eat; therefore, there is no need to take up a club and go out to kill one’s neighbours. And if there is a good, close understanding between both sides, then the Chinese will not feel unwanted in Indonesia and so throw themselves into another uncertain adventure. It would be even worse if the Chinese were to leave Indonesia feeling vengeful against the Indonesian people. And the Indonesian people should not have any feelings of vengeance against the Chinese as the suffering of the Indonesian people has been a legacy of colonial history and of the actions of the feudalists and traitors.

  

Genuine friendship and cooperation can only be built through a joint effort to increase production, unencumbered by the hunt for excessive profits. What is the point of prosperity if the people around you are suffering from want? Does this not just create social enemies that endanger both those who seek profits as well as those who threaten those profits? And will it not be even worse for those very poor?

  

Cooperation and friendship can help increase production, and this, in turn, will promote prosperity. And prosperity is the source of all capabilities. In its turn, prosperity promotes the development of the values of humanity and ingenuity and then multiplies further cooperation and friendship.

  

In this too, the people must be seen as both the measure of success and the final goal. They are the eternal producers, the creators of humanity itself, of friendship and of cooperation. Do not turn away from the people. Approach them as friends. As a friend of the people, you will be a friend of all people, and thus of life itself.

  

Among the people, as their friend, no person will have an excuse for pessimism. Only those who oppress, who are hostile and who exploit them live always in anxiety and fear.

  

Conclusions and Recommendations about the Contributions of the Chinese

  

Nobody can deny the existence and extent of the Chinese contributions to the Indonesian people and to our earth. Given the intensive nature of the Dutch colonisation, there has been a tendency for people not to recognise this. This apathetic approach must be held in check because it diverts things away from scientific perceptions, both among the Indonesian people and the Chinese themselves.

  

These contributions become clearer and more concrete every day if we remember that there are no people anywhere on this earth who have a culture which has developed in total isolation; not in Indonesia, not in China, not in India.

  

It would be very appropriate in the wake of this uproar over the Chinese issue for the Chinese to increase their contribution and in the process, to give proper credit to the Indonesian people. It is sometimes very obvious that some Chinese are so proud of and glorify the culture of their ancestors, but pride alone means nothing because every new thing is useful and beneficial if it is indeed put to use.

  

Conclusions and Proposals regarding Population

  

The Chinese in Indonesia are Indonesian pribumi with their own customs and way of life. And so they should consider the issue of nationalism, which brings citizenship with it. They should not turn their backs on their love for the Indonesian people and earth, as this is something that will be very important for the mental and emotional peace of the Chinese themselves.

  

The Indonesian people should not use the issue of difference in citizenship to put up a useless political dividing screen. The peaceful history of the Chinese in Indonesia over the centuries is proof enough that they have no evil intent towards the Indonesian people. The Dutch accusation that the Chinese wanted to establish a kingdom on Java was just a mantra to justify their total massacre of the Chinese in Batavia in 1740 and provide a basis for denying the demands for accountability made by the victims.

  

There are no grounds for the Indonesian people to cheer the exodus of Chinese back to the PRC. This has no relevance to the interests of the people; nobody will be any the richer by even one or two pairs of underpants.

  

The efforts of some to wipe out the Chinese population in Indonesia, and so help destabilise developments in the PRC, have not succeeded. First, they are returning home voluntarily. Second, they are returning home to a country of hope and, after they go through a psychological adjustment, will be a source of real energy in the country of their ancestors.

  

Conclusions and Proposals on Social Issues

  

All attempts to make the Chinese the target of racial discrimination will create a chain reaction, bringing new discrimination against other peoples and races among the inhabitants of Indonesia. This is true whether the discrimination is official, by private individuals or through publications; whether by an encouraged press or as the result of being given secret support. Whether conscious or otherwise, actions spurred by racial hatred will create a culture of hatred, which will eventually have an impact on every person throughout society.

  

Given how deep connections are between nations today, every racial controversy will provide more opportunities for the imperialists to attempt to regain their empires, even after they have been swept out of Asia or Indonesia. On the other hand, every domestic uproar over race will help fuel the rise of provincialism in Indonesia, which for the moment been eradicated by the Indonesian people, a task which was completed with great difficulty over more than one generation. The spread of these non-revolutionary – in fact, counter-revolutionary – processes can eventually negate the revolution itself.

  

The government needs to understand that the Indonesian state must be the protector of every resident in the land over which it rules, no matter what citizenship the resident holds. The government must only implement policies that affect the population after scientific study so that there is no possibility of acts of terror, whether physical or psychological.

  

We must respect the decision of those Chinese who have decided to take PRC citizenship. It was the Indonesian government itself that issued so many rules and regulations setting out the responsibilities of foreign citizens who are resident here. They have responsibilities to the Indonesian state and they have the right to be treated with respect by the Indonesian government. The Chinese are not some lost chicks who do not know where they come from. They can find their home again very easily. So every act of terror against a foreign citizen in Indonesia, particularly against the Chinese, will damage the prestige of Indonesia in the country of the affected foreign citizens. It is expected that criminals who are caught and arrested will be treated politely and with propriety;so then should foreign citizens (who are guilty of no offence).

  

Nor is it proper to just wash our hands of political failures in Indonesia, throwing the blame at the feet of some group in society. On the contrary, we need to learn from our failures. Without the readiness to learn from failures, we will never provide a proper educational example to the people and will only make it more difficult for them to reach higher levels of modern science and knowledge.

  

Every minority in society usually acts as a small group that has no backbone. In a democratic atmosphere, such a group, particularly the Chinese, has only a minority of votes and as a result, no real political muscle. Because of that, they must be handled with wisdom.

  

The Chinese in Indonesia are friends of the Indonesian people. The issue is how to develop this friendship, to channel and mobilise it to the benefit of everybody, including the Chinese themselves.

  

That some may engage in criminal acts is no reason to blame the Chinese as a group, a group with no political muscle.

  

That the Chinese appear as a group that has separated itself and/or become alienated from society is a negative by-product of unfortunate social historical developments, which should be corrected rather than be used as the basis for acts of suppression, whatever forms that may take. Here we must emphasise again the important role of scholarly and historical institutions in helping the government implement its policies. Policies are not the product of dreams or daydreams. They are the continuation of history. Ignorance of history will surely result in inept policies, no matter who is involved. Every fruit grows from its roots. Indeed every leaf, flower, trunk and stem comes from the roots. And, in turn, the roots come from the organism as a whole, and the organism from the seed. And so there is a never-ending connection.

  

Conclusions and Proposals Regarding Politics

  

In the history of the Indonesian people, there has never been any harm caused because of the Chinese, whether before colonisation or during. Even the Kublai Khan expedition, which in any case, can be described as a Mongol expedition, actually helped extend traditional armaments and facilitated the establishment of Majapahit, which even now is part of the historical pride of the Indonesian people. These good relations should not be sacrificed just to satisfy the ambitions of some politician-adventurers; and it is not important whether they are part of the government or acting as private individuals.

  

These traditionally good relations still exist, and it is appropriate that friendship between the PRC and Indonesia should be maintained and developed further. Both the PRC and Indonesia emerged in the same century as victors over imperialism and colonialism so neither of these countries would want to force or should force colonialism or imperialism on other countries or minorities in their own countries. This shared experience should be the basis of a mutual understanding. The good relations between the two countries should contribute to the development of each other, and it is not appropriate at all for either of these two countries to be indifferent to the fate of the other. Their similar histories also mean they face similar challenges in entering the modern world.

  

Every setback in good relations will cause more unproductive imbalances. In order to maintain these good relations, the Indonesian willingly finances the ministries and offices throughout the country, most particularly the offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

  

Every uproar that weakens the good relations between the PRC and Indonesia just makes it easier for the compradors and world imperialists. More than that even, it weakens the authority of the principles of Bandung and takes away from the significance of the struggles of the two peoples to wipe imperialism and colonialism from the face of the earth.

  

Every inflexible, and especially coarse, action that hurts good relations between the countries of Asia and Africa and that stems from actions against minorities in an individual country, is not useful, no matter how beautiful the words and excuses given to defend such actions. All the Asian and African countries have developed cultures, and it is not at all appropriate to see any of them voluntarily degrade any of these cultures. There is no need to do damage to their reputations and honour by unjust acts, which will also produce new situations that may get out of hand.

  

And it is even more abhorrent if the press is mobilised (directly or indirectly) to justify filthy actions, to whip up and spread hatred and enmity towards a minority as part of an effort to get rid of that minority.

  

Every country that wishes to be respected must show that it is worthy of respect. This can only be done through actions, whether external or domestic, which are honourable and not some kind of crossboy recklessness. It is not right at all that the people should be thrown into uproar or a minority thrown into turmoil just to satisfy the lusts of one or two ambitious people who seek glory. We, the peoples of Asia and Africa, have had our fill of the bitter and painful experiences of colonisation. It is not right that we produce more bitter and painful experiences that are of no use to anybody. Such actions by a people only show an inconsistency with the struggle that has been carried out and that the people have no principles and cannot be trusted.

  

In accordance with the Bandung principles and Pancasila, the Indonesian government has a responsibility to help achieve international peace. This means it also has a responsibility to achieve domestic peace – peace among the different groups of people who live here – and to eradicate the seeds of antagonistic or tense conflict. It means, too, it must calm the anxieties among those countries that are its friends. And as the country that initiated the Asian-African Conference [in Bandung in 1955], Indonesia has a much greater moral responsibility to develop and implement the Bandung principles.

  

The campaigns that have been launched to hurt the Chinese minority (official or unofficial, in general as well as in each specific case) and all the accompanying regulations (applying locally or otherwise, which violate the fundamental rights of Chinese people) cannot be defended. These actions violate our own principles and legitimise a culture of hypocrisy. So if the government does not support the rise of a culture of hypocrisy, it should take action against the press waging anti-Chinese campaigns, which has been allowed to cover Indonesia in shame and humiliation. And to allow the press to go hunting after the Chinese like this also damages our national prestige, which has not yet reached an acceptable level but only exposes a lazy spirit.

  

The friendship between the countries of Asia and Africa needs to be developed and channelled so that it benefits all the countries, contributes to international peace and prosperity, and benefits the people of each individual country. Any effort, any policy – with its associated political moves – that does not contribute to the advancement of the lives of the people should not be implemented.

  

Conclusions and Proposals Regarding Economic Issues

  

The accusation that Chinese capital is not domestic capital but foreign capital is simply political camouflage for the moves by the Indonesian bourgeoisie to get rid of the Chinese. Chinese capital is domestic capital because it is subject to domestic regulations, cannot leave the country, and has no rights regarding the transfer of its profits out of the country.

  

The accusation that Chinese capital acts as a monopoly is made by people who do not understand the structure of our economy, which so far, still is a liberal one. Indonesians have never been banned from entering commerce. And no government in Indonesia has ever formally conferred monopoly rights to the Chinese as a group.

  

The accusations that Chinese capital is not domestic capital and that it has a monopolistic, capitalistic character is a cover for the fact that there is huge, absolute foreign monopolistic capital operating here, namely the Dutch, British and American oil companies, whose positions are backed by laws and official regulations. But because these companies contribute no less than 30% of the state budget, the government says nothing about this monopoly. In fact, some of the statements by cabinet ministers indicate that they think these companies should not be criticised at all, at least for the time being. In fact, the real danger from these giant monopolistic, capitalist firms is very clear. Their not inconsiderable contributions to the budget must give them not a little influence. This situation cannot be corrected by going out and hunting the Chinese. So perhaps it was not a mistake for one prominent party leader in Indonesia to describe the situation thus: Because you do not have the courage to fight the tiger, it is the house cat that you go after.

  

Neither the Chinese nor their capital should be the target of high state policy. What is required rather, are management, supervision and coordination policies based on the President’s manifesto. The issue of the Chinese and Chinese capital could be easily handled by an inter-departmental committee with the Department of Trade as its core. There is no need for a specific foreign policy to deal with this issue. In short, to make this an international issue is very naïve; too much of the authority of the nation is being put at stake. This issue needs to be managed in such a way that it is localised, but in a way that actually develops the country and does not, instead, result in the export of funds and forces.

  

It is a humiliatingly embarrassing accusation that the Chinese and their capital hurt the Indonesian national economy. We all know that we live in a liberal economic environment, where prosperity is determined by capital and its activity. If the Chinese have a weakness, it is that they are traders, and traders do not produce. But traders who are not Chinese must be considered to have the same deficiency. Everyone can understand that the prosperity of a country is determined by whether that country can produce enough for everybody who lives in that territory. If it is insufficient production that causes poverty, then it is not appropriate for a minority, in this case the Chinese, to be held as an enemy of the national economy. The issue is that they, along with all inhabitants of the country, must be taken in a more productive direction. To view them en bloc as criminals is not only narrow-minded and discriminative, but it also provides no prospect for a better future.

  

The creation of a national economy as a part of implementing socialism involves both creating the possibility of savings, of production, and of increasing production as well as the formation and use of capital in the most effective way possible in order to meet the needs of the whole population. It means eliminating the gap between town and village, between production and consumption, and of implementing the most just distribution possible, where the needs of the people are met. This requires a distribution system that is an integral part of the economy. This is not achieved by creating Chinese businessmen who operate at the national level only and are provided with special facilities such as these new, capitalistic monopoly food and clothing shops.

  

In creating a distribution apparatus, there needs to be a realistic approach to the existing apparatus, coordinating, supervising, using and directing it in the direction of establishing socialism. It is not correct to destroy the existing mechanisms without any preparation of a replacement and to bring into being a new mechanism based on the dreams of some bureaucrats, no matter how high up they are. Such behaviour is no more than that of a few Don Quixotes with utopian dreams trying to make waves; it is beautiful in the mind, but it eats away the heart and sickens the stomach.

  

The economy cannot be managed by dreams. The economy demands realism. So all planning, whether short-term or long-term, must be based on the existing reality. Therefore, such planning must include in its calculations every person and all capital that exist in the territory of Indonesia.

  

PP 10 is no more than a ‘beautiful’ creation whereby a people suffering deficiency of capital decides to destroy the capital that it already has in its hands.

  

So, Hs-y, I have come to the end of these musings. To end, I must ask your forgiveness for any deficiencies or any mistakes that I have let pass because of the pressures of time and especially, because of the limited space that I have been given. This is the reason why I am unable now to discuss other issues that have followed from this policy. But aside from whatever deficiencies and errors there may be in this book, I am pleased that I have been able to begin this work within the limitations imposed upon me. And if nothing gets in the way, I would like to write a sequel to this book.

  

Tell me what you think.

### THE CHINESE IN INDONESIA

  

## The First Complete English Translation of

  

## HOAKIAU DI INDONESIA by

  

## Pramoedya Ananta Toer

  

This publication is the first complete English translation of Pramoedya Ananta Toer's seminal 1960 work Hoakiau di Indonesia for which he was detained by the Indonesian authorities for speaking out against the racism and the racialist ideas and policies being propagated at the time.

  

This work is a classic humanist polemic against anti-Chinese racialism as well as an overview of the history of the Chinese community in Indonesia. Remarkably, it is the only significant writing opposing anti-Chinese racism from that period outside of articles written by Chinese community leaders themselves. The humanist ideas and principles eloquently put forth by the author remain every bit as relevant today as when it was first published.

  

This volume contains additional essay contributions from K.S. Jomo, Max Lane, Leo Ou-Fan Lee and Sumit K. Mandal on the author and the work.
