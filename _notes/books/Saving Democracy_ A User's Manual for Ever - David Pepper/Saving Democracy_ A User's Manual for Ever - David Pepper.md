**An Ongoing Conversation**]]Introduction

The arc of the moral universe is long. But it bends. . . in the direction of whoever is pushing it harder, for longer, is pushing.

—Me

Meet Rhoda Denison Bement.

She was at Seneca Falls. But it’s complicated.

Rhoda Denison Bement was actually a regular parishioner at the Wesleyan Methodist Church, where the historic convention took place. But she was only a member there because, five years earlier, she’d been banished from the Presbyterian church down the street. At one point, the ferocity of her abolitionist advocacy erupted into a showdown with that church’s pastor, who put her on trial for disorderly and “unchristian” conduct. She was found guilty, banished, and soon joined the church that would host the women’s rights convention a few years later.

Now let’s take a moment and look at the long arc of Rhoda Denison Bement’s life, and the lives of her fellow suffragists.

Born in 1806, she was kicked out of that first church in 1843. Only thirty-seven years old, but so fierce about abolishing slavery she was banished _from an abolitionist church_. Impressive.

The historic convention at her new church home took place in 1848, when she was forty-two years old.

She would then spend the rest of her eighty-two years as both a conductor of the Underground Railroad and an advocate for women’s suffrage. She died in 1888.

The 19th Amendment wasn’t ratified until 1920.

So, Rhoda Denison Bement spent her entire life raising hell for suffrage she would never see, and that America’s women wouldn’t gain for another thirty-two years _after_ her death.

Now think about the generation that _followed_ her in the movement. Consider the teenagers who watched or read about that 1848 convention. Those women would’ve been in their fifties at the time of Bement’s death, and more than likely _also_ did not live to see the 19th Amendment ratified.

Only the _next_ generation of the movement—the teenagers at the time of Bement’s death—would live to see that historic victory in 1920. Most of them, at least. They would have reached their fifties and sixties when they first exercised their right to vote.

Think about that again: Rhoda Denison Bement, her predecessors, peers, and even the generation of women that _followed her_ dedicated entire lifetimes of struggle to join America’s democracy. These would be lifetimes of disappointment, at least in terms of achieving their ultimate goal. Still, they kept fighting. Only the final generation of that movement, building on the foundations of those who’d endeavored and passed away years before, would experience their joint, multi-generational victory.

You may be asking, why do I know so much about Rhoda Denison Bement?

I’ve known about her for decades. You see, I hail from a long, uninterrupted line of fierce feminists. And Rhoda Denison Bement led the way. She was my great-great-great-great-grandmother. One of my nieces is named Rhoda; another’s middle name is Bement.

As proud as we are of that lineage, I know there are countless Americans just like Rhoda Denison Bement, who waged their own struggles for freedom and equality that only future generations would inherit.

Even _after_ the Civil War and abolition—and long after the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments—it took generations of similar heroes to overcome horrific violence to cement civil rights protections into our nation’s laws. It took another generation after that to convince leaders and courts to actually enforce those laws. Again, like Bement, entire lifetimes of struggle. Many ending in disappointment, never to see progress. And countless lives cut short violently amid that struggle.

John Lewis was one of the fortunate heroes who lived to witness the fruits of generations of action and sacrifice, including his own. But even when John Lewis passed away, some of those fruits were wilting before his eyes. Things were going the other way.

What’s the lesson from Rhoda Denison Bement’s life and legacy, and so many others like her?

It’s that the battle for democracy is a **_long one_**.

It’s not about a single election. Or a single politician. Or even elections alone. It’s not limited to individual lifetimes, or even multiple generations.

And no, it’s not an inevitable arc bending in one positive and inevitable, morally righteous direction. It’s always contested—pushing one way for years, then back the other way for years more. If and how it bends comes down to who’s pushing harder, longer.

It’s a never-ending battle. And it continues today.

Which means we are in that same battle now.

If you’re reading this book because you’re concerned about the state of our democracy, the most important takeaway is to see that _you are in the same struggle Rhoda Denison Bement was in. That John Lewis was in_.

_You_ are a participant in that long struggle for democracy. The never-ending struggle.

Once you realize that, everything changes. And it’s time to adjust everything you do accordingly. This book tries to show you how.

And I wrote this book _now_, and I’m glad you’re reading it _now_, because it’s a critical moment for all who value democracy to understand this reality. And then to take concrete action. _Now_.

* * *

Over the centuries, democracy has undergone surges of revolutionary growth, periods of relative stability, and generations of painful and violent retrenchment.

Around the world, and across the United States, we now find ourselves at a precarious moment—on the edge (over that edge, in too many places) of retrenchment after a brief era of stability.

Here is a basic snapshot of what’s happening on the ground in the United States. As you review these raw facts, imagine what we Americans would say if we saw this in another country:

In state after state, a faction of politicians _rigs legislative districts_ to eliminate accountability and guarantee outcomes in its favor. With their election outcomes pre-ordained, few members of this faction face accountability from voters in their _entire careers_.

Some of that rigging _violates state or federal law_, but that doesn’t seem to matter. In fact, it’s rewarded. Successfully violating federal or state law helped that faction seize the majority of the US House of Representatives after 2022.

Once locked into power, this faction of politicians passes law after law that the majority of its constituents _strongly disagrees with_, but is powerless to stop. And the faction takes steps to make it even more difficult for the voters of these states to stop them. This includes routinely _altering election rules_ to minimize the political power of those who most oppose them. It also includes a continual _giveaway of public funds_ and goods to private interests, who funnel a portion of those funds _back_ to campaign war chests—some public, some hidden—that keep those politicians in power.

The faction also passes laws and advances rhetoric that lead to _violence against certain groups_. And they pass laws _limiting the expression_ of those out of power, including curbing how they can protest and what subjects can be taught in schools or shared in libraries. They even censure and expel fellow lawmakers for expressing contrary viewpoints, while stripping power from officials who pose a threat to them.

Political candidates and officeholders from the faction don’t just defy the law, but the _outcome of legitimate elections_—be they elections for political positions, or referenda voted on directly by the people. “Election deniers” are running for offices around the country—and in November 2022, many of them won. They now control the majority of the House of Representatives and many of its most important committees. As writer Sarah Kendzior summed up: “People who attempted to overthrow the federal government are now creating the policies of the federal government. People who are national security threats are now dictating national security.”[^1]

Importantly, the faction’s anti-democratic efforts _build off one another_. For example, as they gained control of the House in 2022, intense gerrymandering played a major role. In those states where the faction controlled the districting process, only one competitive district emerged among the ninety Congressional districts where those who voted against certifying the 2020 Presidential election sought re-election. The voters of that lone competitive district held that member accountable, tossing him from office. In the eighty-nine non-competitive districts, the people had no opportunity to do the same.[^2] Cordoned off from their own electorates—wholly unaccountable for their actions—all those members waltzed back into office and into the majority.

![[f013-1.jpg]]

As opposed to serving as an independent check against such undemocratic and/or lawless actions, many _American courts_ appear as politicized as every other institution. They fail to hold lawbreakers accountable, and often reward and cement into place the actions that are undermining democracy. This is by design in many states, as the faction in power—seeking to eliminate the final check on its power—alters the way that the courts that review its work are selected or elected in the first place.

Beyond the halls of government, _signs of authoritarianism_ are emerging in American society more broadly. Armed intimidation. Violence and domestic terrorism. Nationalism and nativism. Active and repeated disinformation. Corruption. Antisemitism, racism, white supremacy. Other forms of extremism. And much of it being mainstreamed and normalized.

Again, the descent I’ve just described is not occurring in faraway foreign capitals. It’s not the American South in the 1880s and 1890s, when the KKK and Jim Crow emerged to destroy the new democracy ushered in by Reconstruction.

No. This is a cold-eyed view of American politics, in state after state and in the nation’s capital. Today.

And while some view the 2022 midterm elections as a big win for democracy, none of the sobering directions above fundamentally changed. Some are accelerating, just as they did after 2012, 2018, and 2020. As the political analyst Michael Podhorzer explains, viewing 2022 as democracy’s victory only results from a view “distracted from the enormity of what’s happened to this country” since Obama’s victory in 2008, when the anti-democratic backlash began.[^3]

I wrote _Laboratories of Autocracy_ over five months of 2021 because I was alarmed that too few Americans, including its leaders, saw events on the ground for what they are—a broad, aggressive attack on democracy and the rule of law that anchors it. It’s an attack we would see clearly if it occurred elsewhere, but one that we struggle to see within our own borders and in our own backyards. The subtitle of _Laboratories_ was _A Wakeup Call from Behind the Lines_, and I meant it.

Fortunately, polls show that in early 2023 more Americans _have_ woken up to the threat. And are fearful of it. Countless books and cable TV shows focus on the growing risk. With millions watching the January 6 hearings, a retired (and conservative) federal judge warned the country that America faces a “clear and present danger.” The President of the United States devoted several addresses to the risk in the fall of 2022.

But even as more people perceive the threat, there’s a looming fatalism about the nation’s ability to stop it. A gnawing sense that maybe it’s too late, or that nothing can be done. That we may only be one or two election outcomes from the end of our democracy.

A prime driver for the foreboding has been the repeated failure to stop the descent. As clear as the threat appears, as many warning bells are ringing, the efforts to protect democracy don’t appear to work. The attack keeps grinding away, and those who value democracy seem unable to stop it.

_Even when the pro-democracy side wins the elections it prioritizes_, those attacking democracy still plod forward, undeterred. And despite those wins, democracy still feels in the balance in the _next_ election. Just one loss, and it’s over. If democracy is surviving on such thin ice—“saved” every two years through razor-thin margins in certain states—something is deeply wrong.

The fall away from democracy is real, and sobering. But is it inevitable?

I began writing this book in the middle of 2022 because I reject that fatalism. And some of the successes from the November 2022 elections shone a light on how we can overcome these attacks. But even those elections and their aftermath remind us of the ongoing risk and need for vigilance.

American democracy _can_ be resuscitated—its roots planted far more deeply into our soil. American governance _can_ once again reflect the voted will of the broad, diverse electorate that comprises the American majority. We _can_ resolve our differences through politics, and accept the results of fair elections where all Americans have equal access to the polls. Democracy does not need to feel like it’s on life support every election cycle.

Indeed, democracy in America has overcome far greater challenges than those it faces now. Study the abolitionists. Model the suffragists like Rhoda Denison Bement. Look at John Lewis’s lifetime of struggle, and the generations who came before him. To say the least, they started off in a far more imposing place than where America finds itself now.

But. . . that revival will only happen when those fighting for democracy understand the battle for what it is, where it’s being lost and why, and reframe their battle plan accordingly. And it will only happen if every American who values democracy contributes to the fight.

* * *

_Laboratories of Autocracy_ began that project, walking through the hidden breadth, depth, and intensity of the current attack on democracy. After doing so, its final chapters outlined thirty steps we must take to fight back. One of the responses I heard most from readers was—“I skipped to the end. I wanted to get to the solutions.”

So, _Saving Democracy_ skips to the end.

It explains why and how those who value democracy must go on offense. And how they can stay on offense and win on offense. Everywhere.

But it doesn’t do this at thirty thousand feet.

Of course, there is so much those at the highest levels of power can and must do to more effectively protect democracy. This book offers a lot for these leaders to consider.

But they are not my primary audience.

Who is?

Everyday Americans who are disturbed about the state of our democracy. Who are angry, watching an extreme ideology dominate the governance of much of our country even as a majority disagrees. Scared, by its direct impact on them, those they know and love, or the country writ large. Frustrated, after working hard amid a busy schedule to change things but not seeing that hard work halt the decline. Tired, and looking for new answers on what to do. Determined, that we must do better.

If any or all of these describe you, then think of this as _**your** user’s manual for saving democracy_. A combination battle plan and practical toolkit, explaining what you can do, immediately and over time, wherever you are. And let me confess right up front—you’re the intended audience of this book because I firmly believe that, to succeed, democracy needs YOU, collectively, to play the _leading_ role in its survival.

So, _Saving Democracy_ is meant to spur action. _Your_ action. I’ve structured it to challenge and guide each reader—no matter your role in your community or politics or where you work—on how _you_ each can play a more active role in lifting democracy than you might have imagined. And if you’re already active—and frustrated—it offers ways that your hard work can be more effective and rewarding. My hope is that over the course of the book, you will construct your own personal plan to fight for democracy. And when you finish, you’ll be ready to execute that plan.

Along the way, _Saving Democracy_ introduces you to individuals who took on the very roles and activities I’m suggesting you consider in the chapters that follow. Modern-day successors to Rhoda Denison Bement. Their stories make clear that everyone, including you, can play these roles.

And, boy, do we need every last person who cares about democracy to step up. To bring fighting for democracy into what each of us does every day—socially, civically, professionally. Even economically.

That’s the only way we’ll scale up our fight to save and perfect this precious democracy of ours. . . against those who scaled up their battle _against_ democracy a generation ago and who’ve been waging that battle ever since.

So yes, they have a big head start.

Which means there’s no time to waste. Let’s get going.

**The Two Battles**

Why does the side fighting _for_ democracy struggle so much?

The answer turns out to be simple. Painfully simple.

Let me break it down with a basic analogy.

Let me introduce you to Rhoda Denison Bement’s great-great-great-great-great-grandson. My son, Jack. He turned eight around the time that I first wrote these words.

Jack loves soccer.

And even at eight years old, he already understands a core concept: if one team is always on the other team’s side of the field, firing away at the goal, that team will likely win. The longer the game goes on, the _more_ likely the side always on offense will win. And the more games that take place, the more games the side always on offense will win.

![[f021-1.jpg]]

Jack gets this. He prefers defense, and is quite fast (for a Pepper especially!). Whenever the ball crosses over to his team’s side of the field, he races as fast as he can to kick the ball back to the other side. The young man is like a guided missile with one mission in mind: get the ball back to the offense.

So, Jack, at only eight, would quickly understand why those who are fighting _for_ democracy in America have been losing that fight.

It’s slightly more complicated, but the one-sided soccer game Jack so intuitively understands captures what’s been happening in American politics for a generation, and still today.

And if the team that cares about democracy doesn’t figure out quick that that’s the predicament we’re in, and adjust everything we’re doing to reverse it (rush to the ball like Jack does, kick it to the other side, and then keep it there), the other side’s going to keep winning.

Some of the most painful parts of our history, and other countries’ histories, confirm young Jack’s instinct. If one side continually attacks democracy in the places and institutions that shape democracy, and the other side doesn’t engage in that battle, the attacking side wins.

To be blunt, that’s how we got Jim Crow.

And it’s where we find ourselves today.

Before getting to what you and every American can do to effectively battle for democracy, it’s crucial to understand _why_ today’s battle over American politics is akin to the one-sided soccer game that would so trouble an eight-year-old. Then adjust our approach accordingly.

I promise—we’ll get to solutions quickly. But recognizing the dilemma is essential to overcoming it, helps us avoid costly mistakes we are now making, and ensures that all striving to turn things around budget our limited time, energy, and resources most effectively.

Beyond that, seeing that there’s a far better way to protect democracy than what we’ve been doing can be downright energizing. It is for me!

* * *

At the risk of oversimplifying things, I’m going to present the two sides in the grand battle of American politics.

Brace yourself—it’s not what you think.

Let’s call the two sides Team D and Team A.

And let’s zero in on the battle as each team _understands_ it. It turns out, the two teams see the battle very differently, and this means they fight it differently as well.

In fact, there are _two_ battles taking place. The sooner we see that, and come to terms with it, the better. And once you see it, you can’t unsee it. . . I hope.

**Team D’s Battle: Election Outcomes**

Those on Team D support democracy, and desire to live within the confines and rules of a robust democracy. Importantly, two assumptions shape Team D’s political battle.

First, for a generation or more, Team D has generally assumed that American democracy is intact. That it’s stable. “We’re the USA—we’re a democracy.” Simple. Democracy is as American as mom and apple pie. It’s just who we are. Of course it’s here to stay. Right? (Wrong, but we’ll get to that in a few.) Regardless, this assumption of a stable and intact democracy grounds Team D’s battle.

Second, most on Team D are buoyed by a second assumption—they are confident that their policies and preferred directions generally reflect the broader preferences of America’s diverse majority. And from abortion access to common sense gun reforms to a middle-class based economics (as opposed to trickle-down) to public education, polls back them up on this. So, elections on a fair playing field, over time, are the logical vehicle for Team D to implement its policies and overall worldview. Because if given a choice, an informed electorate will choose their preferred outcomes and those who advocate for them.[^4]

![[f025-1.jpg]]

Grounded on these two assumptions—that democracy is stable and that it represents a majority viewpoint—Team D devotes its time, energy, and resources to contesting elections on that assumed level playing field. By winning those elections, Team D can implement its desired substantive outcomes within that stable democratic world.

So those are the basics.

One outgrowth of this approach is that Team D prioritizes the elections it perceives to offer the most effective and efficient path to 1) win and 2) implement its desired outcomes.

Federal elections.

Which naturally leads to a cyclical frenzy of activity and energy every two years—when federal elections take place—and an explosion of energy, passion, and investment for the presidential election every four years.

And it also leads to a relentless focus on the “swing” states and “swing” districts that together add up to those sought-after federal majorities. Win certain states and you win the presidency and the US Senate. Win certain districts and you win the US House. So, the thinking has been that focusing by far the most time and resources on those areas—maybe a half-dozen states, and a few dozen districts—is the most effective and efficient way to win the battle of American politics.

![[f026-1.jpg]]

When Team D wins these federal goals—as it did in 2008 or 2020—it celebrates as if it has won the _entire_ American political battle.

The media, by the way, generally covers politics in this same frame: stable democracy, focused largely on federal elections and battles over federal policy, determined by swing states and districts. And this is largely how everyday Americans see it as well. All other politics is secondary, if that.

(Importantly, even as folks on Team D have come to understand that democracy is at risk, they largely adhere to political strategies that assume it is stable. And even as the media are waking up to the risk, they continue to _cover_ politics through a frame that assumes it is stable.[^5])

**Team A’s Battle: Democracy Itself**

Now let’s look at the folks on the other side. We’ll call them Team A.

Team A finds itself in a very different battle—and knows it. In fact, its entire approach is grounded on the polar opposite assumptions from those made by Team D.

First, this collection of groups and interests correctly understands that the policies they seek are generally unpopular (often toxic) and would not survive long in a world of robust democracy. Whether those policies be intense trickle-down economics and a vision of “economic freedom” that leave most Americans out, extreme social policies that are opposed by a majority or supermajority of Americans, or the long-simmering desire for white-dominated governance in an ever more diverse majority—these groups _understand_ that their views are mired in minority status. As I write in _Laboratories of Autocracy_, they acknowledge this reality explicitly. It’s why Mitch McConnell so regularly shuts down his own members from talking about issues, be it Lindsey Graham (abortion ban[^6]) or Rick Scott (gutting social security). McConnell understands that their stances on these issues are unpopular—even if they form core parts of their agenda.

This keen-eyed understanding that their policies are deeply unpopular shapes their entire battle. Because that unpopularity means that if all this side does is engage in a repeated battle to win elections in a robust democracy (i.e., Team D’s battle), over time, that will surely be a losing battle. In other words, robust democracy is inconsistent with the long-term, sustained fulfillment of their unpopular agenda. And this cold reality—that robust democracy is an obstacle to their agenda, and not a mechanism to achieve it—is the anchoring insight that shapes _their_ battle.

Which leads to Team A’s second assumption: that democracy is _not_ necessarily stable, or intact. That democracy can be undermined, or worse, in all sorts of ways. Sadly, the history of our country and countries around the world confirms that this sober assumption about the vulnerability of democracy is entirely correct.

![[f029-1.jpg]]

So, with those two assumptions in mind, Team A chooses a different battle than Team D.

Theirs is _not_ a battle to win elections in a robust democracy. They know that would be a _losing_ strategy.

_Their battle is to subvert democracy itself, at least enough to lock their unpopular views into place on a sustained basis._

I know. . . this sounds like a really controversial assertion. But the truth is, Team A doesn’t hide that this is its frame of mind. Peter Thiel, the billionaire who bankrolled the Senate campaigns of right-wing candidates like JD Vance, wrote in 2009, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.”[^7] The Koch Brothers have been operating from that philosophy for a generation. And in 2022, the conservative group CPAC held a major conference in Hungary, celebrating the anti-democratic approach perfected by Viktor Orban. Orban followed that visit with a trip to Texas to celebrate with CPAC even more. And in case anyone missed the signal, CPAC plans to return to Hungary again in 2023.

So, what is Team A’s strategy to win their very different battle—an open battle against a robust democracy to impose their unpopular agenda?

Simple: target the places that can 1) advance their unpopular agenda and 2) seal themselves off from democratic accountability for those unpopular policies and stances.

And where can you do that?

Hint: in the United States, those places do not reside in the federal government—at least not primarily. As _Laboratories of Autocracy_ walks through in great detail, they are in states, starting with state legislatures/statehouses.[^8] Along with other positions at the state and local level.

Why?

First, these state legislatures control almost every substantive issue Americans care about, and that Team A especially cares about—everything from the economy, to regulations, the administration of justice, to social issues. So, an investment in statehouses turns out to be returned many times over in the form of tax breaks, deregulation, giveaways to corporations, mass privatization of public resources and assets (i.e., public schools, energy, etc.), anti-worker policies, and other steps. In the right hands, a state legislature offers an outright bonanza for Team A.

And as we witness with never-ending attacks on _Roe v. Wade_, ever looser gun laws, attacks on equality itself, censorship, and the like, these legislatures can ram through a deeply unpopular agenda on social issues as well. Add it up, and almost the entire agenda Team A values can be accomplished via statehouses.

![[f031-1.jpg]]

But crucially, these statehouses also enjoy enormous power to shape democracy itself. For example, they play a major role in setting the rules and processes of elections, state and federal, which can alter who votes in these elections in ways that impact the ultimate outcome. In most states, they wield the power to draw their own legislative districts, as well as those for Congress, which can change outcomes, thwart representation (locking a minority into majority power), and, at its most extreme, remove any accountability for almost every elected member of these legislatures. And state legislatures even allocate the electors who determine the President of the United States.

![[f032-1.jpg]]

In the wrong hands, these levers of control over democracy allow statehouses to construct fortresses of power wholly removed from and unaccountable to the people of these states. In recent decades, especially, they have sealed themselves off from the voting public—untouchable when it comes to their own electorate. This allows them to repeatedly enact measures that serve Team A’s narrow and unpopular agenda, and there’s little the people of these states or anyone else can do about it.

Understanding the immense power these states exercise over both their substantive goals and democracy itself, Team A naturally focuses most of its battle there—the state legislatures and all the accompanying offices that can bolster (or if they were to lose them, undermine) their agenda. An agenda which would, again, face inevitable failure in a world of robust democracy. But an agenda which thrives when conducted in a political world with no accountability.

Now, because _any_ state can help implement Team A’s substantive agenda while stifling democracy and accountability, each state represents power. Control of any state represents enormous opportunity. So, Team A doesn’t limit its battle to a narrow field of federal swing states. It battles _in ALL fifty states_, and it does so _whenever_ there are elections at any level that might impact its agenda, or democracy. Which is, in the end, every year.

![[f033-1.jpg]]

And Team A has also learned that these states can accomplish far more of their agenda when they work in concert with one another—pushing parallel measures all at once, learning and adjusting to various states’ successes and failures. In short, they can provide the inverse role that Justice Brandeis envisioned when he labelled states “Laboratories of Democracy” a century ago.

To be clear, this side also wages a battle at the federal level. In America, the presidency will always be the grand prize. And federal positions can impact regulation, taxation, and spending. But federal elected positions also have roles to play in Team A’s battle against democracy. Both federal elected officials and judges have the power to _block_ the agenda this side is ramming through statehouses. Fearful of that check, Team A must attain at least enough power at the federal level that, using tools like the filibuster (where they can obstruct measures even when in a minority) and federal judgeships, it can stymie the federal government from blocking its relentless advance in states.

But still, this side never loses sight that the heart of its success arises from permanent control of as many states and legislatures as possible. That’s where it gets almost its entire agenda accomplished, while also improving its prospects at the federal level.[^9]

One other thing: because there is so little attention on state legislatures, and so little comparative pushback from the other side at that level, this battle turns out to be a far _easier_ battle than the one at the federal level. Much of it takes place with almost no one paying attention, including the media, which covers the federal battle almost exclusively while local media withers on the vine. Many of Team A’s seats across this battlefield go uncontested. And even when contested, countless campaigns for those seats are so underfunded by those who support democracy, they may as well be uncontested.

Again—it’s Jack’s nightmare. Team A is always on offense on the side of the field that shapes democracy, while Team D is hardly engaged on that side of the field at all.

And because of tools such as gerrymandering and voter suppression that come with controlling statehouses, the battle also grows _easier as they go_. Once Team A locks up a state, seizing power over that state’s democracy, it becomes ever harder for Team D to reassert itself. (Poor Jack is now apoplectic—the more the opposing team scores, the easier it gets for them to keep the ball on his side of the field and score again.)

So, in the end, there isn’t just one battle taking place in American politics.

The two sides are engaged in _two_ fundamentally different battles.

One side is battling for election outcomes, focused largely on the federal level. The other side is battling democracy itself. . . in states. . . everywhere. Always on offense, the battle getting easier as they go.

**The Two Battles Joined: Who Wins?**

Now what happens when these two teams engage in their respective battles, repeatedly and over time?

![[f036-1.jpg]]

Let’s play it out.

Hint: Jack Pepper already knows the answer. It’s why he runs so fast to kick the ball back to the other side, so his team’s offense can get to work.

Team D wins its fair share of _its_ battle for federal seats in swing areas. The House. The Senate. The Presidency. It’s cyclical, of course. But in good cycles and with good candidates, this side wins and celebrates as if all is won. In bad cycles and with bad candidates, this side loses, thinking it has lost everything.

But what of Team A, leading with its state-based battle, usually against less-organized and underfunded opposition?

Whatever happens at the federal level, Team A almost _inevitably_ wins its battle at the state level. And every Team A victory in any state becomes an important foothold—often a permanent gain—in its long-term battle.

Even worse for Team D, Team A often wins _even in years where it loses at the federal level._ And even amid Team D’s federal victories, Team A still uses the filibuster and the federal judiciary to prevent Team D from scoring points for democracy through federal legislation. Ask yourself, who had the better year in 2021 when it came to the long-term battle over democracy, even after Team D _won_ its battle in 2020, celebrating as if it had won everything?

In summary, in _its_ battle, Team A—the side attacking democracy—is _almost always winning._

_Always on offense._

_Almost always making gains, which then secure future gains._

Team D—the side supporting democracy—sporadically wins its more narrow federal battle. It’s even on a roll of late. But it almost always loses the broader battle for democracy because it’s hardly engaged in it. As in 2020, it sometimes loses the broader battle for democracy _even in years when it wins its federal battle._ In other cases, like 2010, it’s still celebrating winning its battle as Team A dominates its own.

Add it all up, and this is a crisis Jack would understand.

Can we?

* * *

The stark reality is that those attacking democracy will keep advancing until Team D engages in the same battle.

With equal vigor.

With equal stamina.

Wherever the battle is taking place. Which is everywhere, starting in the states.

And if the side _for_ democracy doesn’t engage in that same battle, history tells us that the side attacking democracy will succeed.

But crucially, as some bright spots in 2022 showed, if the side _for_ democracy _does_ engage in that battle in the right way, it can still succeed. To answer a question I’m asked all the time, it is _not_ too late.

The rest of this book walks through how Team D must reframe and re-strategize all it’s doing to go on _offense_ for democracy.

And that new frame turns out to be empowering, because it clarifies the most productive ways every reader and every organization can work to save democracy. I’ll review many of those lessons as well.

The bottom line is—there is so much more we can each do. And that together, we can all do.

That we _must_ do.

**Reframing the Battle—Democracy Itself**

[T]he first, the grandest, and most decisive act of judgment which the Statesman and General exercises is rightly to understand. . . the War in which he engages.

—Carl von Clausewitz

In the current battle over American democracy, the pro-democracy side has largely failed to understand the war “in which [we] engage.”

And here is that battle. Based on one reality:

**Democracy is fragile, not stable. It can be lost. And as always, it is under sustained attack. Not just in other countries, but here in the United States. In state after state. And it must be defended.**

History tells us that Team A’s assumption is correct: under sustained attack, democracy as we conceive it can disappear in America just like it can anywhere else. And if it disappears, it can be gone for a long time—as it was under Jim Crow to horrific effect.

And today, while intact in many parts of America, robust and representative democracy is fraying or largely gone in too many other places—replaced by a system of guaranteed outcomes at the state legislative level, deep corruption of the public process, and a complete lack of accountability for so-called “elected” and other officials. The connection between the voting public and those who represent them is shattered all over. In most places, Black Americans are feeling the brunt of this attack more than anyone else.

This development should alarm anyone who cares about democratic governance _wherever_ they live. Because, again, as with Jim Crow, a sustained attack at the _state level can_ succeed in undermining democracy at the national level. For generations.

So, the political battle of our time involves an intense attack on democracy across our country. History tells us that the most critical question in that battle is: will those who care about democracy fight back sufficiently, or won’t they? That’s the variable that determines the outcome.

As a historical matter, the Founders, as they built a fledgling democracy, understood this fight. They knew that the state of democracy itself would _always_ be at the center of the American political battle. Having designed our system through compromise, they also knew where that attack might come from. James Madison explicitly warned about the danger that undemocratic states posed to the nation’s democracy.

Statehouses, in the wrong hands—in undemocratic hands—had enough power to undermine the nation’s democracy. And Madison and others feared that outside forces—corrupt interests, even the monarchy—could use statehouses as their vehicle to undermine the new nation’s democracy.

But Madison didn’t just warn about this risk. He and others understood it so profoundly they wrote into the Constitution a protection phrased like no other. That protection was so important to the Founders, it comes directly _before_ the promise that the United States would protect individual states from foreign invasion.

Now what’s so important that it would appear directly _before_ the need to halt foreign invasions?

The Founders’ answer: protecting democratic governance _in states_.

The risk of an attack on democracy from within struck them as that serious. And the need to defend democracy that paramount.

Or, as they wrote in Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution:

The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of government . . .

_Shall guarantee._ That’s as mandatory as words get in law.

_Republican Form of government_. We know from contemporary writings and academics that by “Republican Form of government,” those words meant that these states must reflect the will of the people of those states. That the people were sovereign.

So long as state legislatures reflected the people of their states through a Republican Form of government, their thinking went, the powers of that state would be used in furtherance of the new nation’s democracy. But once in corrupt, undemocratic hands, those same state powers could be used to undermine the new nation.

Sound familiar?

Centuries later, those who care about democracy need to again see the battle over politics the same way: as a battle over democratic governance itself, beginning in states. And from the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution to our voices and power at the state and local level, we must reshape our battle plan and wield every tool at our disposal to fight and win _that_ battle_._

This adjustment in mindset is even more urgent because that’s exactly how the side battling _against_ democracy has seen and waged it for a generation. Again, they have a big head start.

_So. . . make the adjustment. See the battle for what it is. See it how the other side sees it. How and where they undertake it. Then **match** their battle. Even better, over-match it._

One benefit of this broader frame is it makes painfully clear the strategic adjustments those fighting for democracy _must_ make in order to succeed. And these adjustments shape how all Americans fighting _for_ democracy should rethink that fight, including their own role in it. (Hint: you have a much bigger role than you think.)

Here are seven:

**Strategic Adjustment 1: The Battle _for_ Democracy is a _Long Battle._**

Remember Rhoda Denison Bement.

And John Lewis.

They understood that the battle for democracy is a **_long one_**. A never-ending struggle. And they waged it accordingly.

Once we understand that we are in a battle over democracy itself—like Bement and women suffragists, like Lewis and civil rights heroes—we must change our own timeframe of all we do.

The plans. The strategies. The funding. Our persistence and stamina. The ways we measure success or failure. All need to be in the context of that long battle for democracy.

In countless ways, the failure to adopt this longer-term timeframe deeply undermines the fight for democracy. Political approaches, tactics, and investments solely aimed in pursuit of short-term strategies to secure next-cycle election victories never build a long-term plan or a larger and sustained pro-democracy infrastructure. Tied to the short-cycle mindset, political parties and voter engagement efforts explode in size for months, then shrink down to nothing the rest of the time. Blind to long-term needs, we commit unforced error after unforced error—errors we can no longer afford to make.

Failure to see the long game also means that those in the battle often measure their success or failure based on all the wrong criteria. _Did we win a particular swing federal race in a federal cycle?_ is all we ask, as opposed to whether we advanced the deeper cause of democracy itself. Which means we might unintentionally reject strategies or dismantle programs that may work long-term, while clinging to others that won’t.

The best present-day example of someone who sees the battle for democracy in the appropriate long frame is Stacey Abrams.

If Abrams had only measured her progress by federal results in short-term cycles, she would have quit years ago. But she knew that democracy itself was at stake in Georgia, and that the battle for democracy is a long game. So she pursued a variety of strategies within that long game, and stuck to or adjusted those strategies over a drawn-out period of time.

Her wider lens brought many benefits, but a key one was that Abrams saw success in that long game even as others saw failure. When Abrams came up short in her governor’s race in 2018, in a highly tainted race, she still announced that Georgia had “made progress.” Those using a short-game measuring stick to judge success probably were dismissive—but two years later, Abrams showed us all who was right. Two years after that, she was right again.

What did she see that they didn’t? She was measuring her battle for a more robust Georgia democracy on a much broader and longer trajectory. Viewing her work through that long-game lens, Abrams knew that democracy was advancing via the countless voters she and others had inspired, registered, and protected through her variety of pro-democracy activities. Year in and year out, as opposed to tearing apart a prior election’s infrastructure, she and her team kept building off of an ever-higher foundation. And after 2018, despite her own personal loss, she built yet again, generating results the nation would celebrate only two years later.

That’s a positive example of seeing and shaping the battle for democracy as a long game.

Unfortunately, there are also countless examples of mistakes made—often unseen—when we view politics as a short-term battle over the next federal election. I’ll go through a number of those in this and future chapters.

_Bottom line: the first implication of realizing that we’re in a battle for democracy itself is that it’s a long battle. A never-ending battle. The historical battle since our Founding._

Every strategy and tactic must be designed with that long battle in mind. Every outcome assessed along those lines. And every short-term strategy and tactic must be reassessed within that long-game perspective.

**Strategic Adjustment 2: The Battle for Democracy Must Be Fought in _All Fifty States_.**

Take a moment and go to the map of the United States displayed by the State Policy Network (SPN) website—one of the Team A think tanks that pushes right-wing policies all over the country: it’s at [https://spn.org/directory/](https://spn.org/directory/\).

On this SPN map, you’ll find something interesting. Our great country is not divided into red states and blue states. The SPN doesn’t simply highlight the states that Republicans already control, or that the Republicans need to win to secure the presidency or the Senate majority. To the contrary, every state is the same color. And when you click on each state, you’ll see every single one has at least one state affiliate identified. The most are in GOP-controlled states, of course. But they also exist in states dominated by Democrats.

In Stowe, Vermont, they’ve got the Ethan Allen Institute. In Chicago, they’ve got the Illinois Policy Institute. In Honolulu, they’ve got the Grassroots Institute of Hawaii.

You can see the same thing with a group called the American Legislative Exchange Council, a key arm of Team A that harnesses the power of statehouses to serve their own ends. Their legislative members aren’t simply from red states. They’re from everywhere.

The point is, the broader fight _against_ democracy is being waged everywhere, even in states that are as blue as it gets. Why is that? Because every single state impacts the issues that affect us all every day. Because every single state plays a role in shaping democracy, or undermining it. And because control of _any_ state—whatever impact it may have on the federal map—can bring huge benefits for those undermining democracy.

Another benefit is that any one state can serve as a petri dish for policies and strategies that can then be adopted in other states (through groups like SPN and ALEC). So if one side locks up dozens of states, the power of that network—of that collective control over both issues and democracy itself—far surpasses the independent power of each of those states added together.

In contrast, for Team D—those who assume democracy is intact and therefore play the game of short-term, federal majority math—the map looks very different, but all too familiar. It’s the map we usually see on our computer and TV screens come election time.

It _is_ a map of red states and blue states, along with a number of purple swing states that will likely determine who controls the federal majority. Those purple states have big circles around them; in any year, perhaps a half-dozen states are circled.

![[f049-1.jpg]]

And it is _that map—and those circled swing states—_that largely dictate where the side that supports democracy wages its fight. Whether it’s legal battles or registration efforts or targeted races or where we invest large amounts of political money, this side largely focuses on the handful of swing states in the nation that will determine the presidential election, or US Senate seats and other state-wide offices are contested.

So, while Team A values every state as an opportunity for power (and profit), Team D largely steers clear of “red states” because they bring no value to the federal majority math that anchors their battle. Investing in them is dismissed as a waste of money and resources. Hopeless naivete.

But as I asked in the introduction, what happens if the side attacking democracy is waging its battle in fifty states, but those fighting for democracy are doing so in those small number of circled states? The anti-democracy side is always making gains.

Even worse, to the extent that the pro-democracy side abandons states once they’re painted red for federal election purposes, the anti-democracy side’s gain in those states locks in permanently. And the damage is especially great when these states are always pushing new approaches, always testing, always learning, always sharing (again, via ALEC and SPN among others), never relenting. The more petri dishes, the better. Before you know it, a number of states have adopted new measures with scant resistance, which builds momentum to push those measures elsewhere.

_Bottom line: the defense for democracy must take place in all fifty states. On an ongoing basis_:

First, it’s a matter of principle. _Not a single American_ should live in a state that doesn’t meet the definition of a functioning democracy.

Second, it’s a Constitutional mandate. It may be overlooked, but that Constitutional guarantee of democratic governance in all states is foundational. We must live up to it.

Third, only battling in a handful of states is self-defeating. If you don’t compete everywhere, you’re depriving yourself of potential victories. In 2022, for example, voters in Kentucky, Montana and Kansas voted _in favor_ of abortion access in their states. The people of those states showed they aren’t as extreme as the politicians occupying their legislatures. Poll after poll shows the same thing. But if you don’t engage in candidate elections in those states—because they happen not to be federal swing states—you don’t give yourself a chance for similar victories in the short- and long-term.

Fourth, not competing in countless states renders great damage even in states where you’re unlikely to win. Politics without competition fuels extremism. And extremism unchecked—facing no incentive to moderate—only leads to more extremism. Look around: the decision not to compete in state after state, over time, has fueled an explosion of extremism all over the country. Iowa (Obama), Indiana (Obama), and Missouri (Clinton) were blue not all that long ago; now they are poster children of right-wing extremism.

When you bring a federal swing-state mindset to politics, you blind yourself to all this damage. But once you view politics within the long game for democracy, it becomes instantly clear what an unmitigated disaster it is to abandon dozens of American states to the side that is relentlessly attacking democracy. In the end, it guarantees their long-term success in so many ways, and fuels that downward spiral of extremism.

This required adjustment—committing to fight for democracy in all states—has major implications for how we do so much in politics. Recruiting. Investing. Engaging. Volunteering. We’ll review all that later.

But it also has a profound implication for every American who cares about democracy. It means that you can and must fight for democracy _wherever_ you live.

No more gazing at federal swing states from afar as if that’s where the only important political battle is happening. No more assuming the battle is a long way away.

No, it starts within the state where you live.

**Strategic Adjustment 3: _State Legislatures_ are the Front Lines of Democracy. _Contest Every District_.**

But committing to a fifty-state strategy is still not enough. Once there, we have to make a similar adjustment _within_ states.

First, it’s critical for Team D to finally see that the front line against democracy is in state legislatures. That’s _where_ Team A is relentlessly focused.

To use the soccer analogy above, the players that are always on offense—taking largely unobstructed shots on Team D’s goal—are locked-up and unaccountable statehouses across the country and their gerrymandered members.

![[f053-1.jpg]]

Still today, Team D does not respond rationally to this reality. After the _Dobbs_ opinion, for example, the overwhelming response from national Democratic leaders was to pivot back to federal politics—the Senate, the Supreme Court. That’s too narrow. The law that led to _Dobbs_ emerged from Mississippi. So the response must also be: let’s hold whoever passed that law in Mississippi and other states accountable for doing so. In too many places, those responsible for these laws don’t even face opponents.

_We can’t just insist on a better goalie; let’s start obstructing the shots in the first place, where they’re being taken!_

Second, Team D must also broaden its in-state battlefield to incorporate all corners of states. Not just a few swing areas.

![[f054-1.jpg]]

Of course, when the political battle is framed as simply competing in swing states for a federal majority, then leaving countless statehouse districts uncontested doesn’t appear to matter. So in 2020, most people didn’t think twice about the fact that in Texas, Georgia, Arizona, Ohio, and other states, hundreds of seats went uncontested, and even more were wholly underfunded, so much so that tens of millions of Americans saw no competition for their statehouse district. And in 2022, despite critical elections in so many swing states, it was just as bad.

But once you frame the political battle as being about democracy itself, and once you realize that most of American democracy is shaped in those statehouses, the disastrous consequences of leaving countless districts uncontested, year after year, becomes painfully clear. I’ll explore the extent of that damage and how we combat it in Chapter 5.

_Bottom line: We must field candidates in every district in every state in our country. And we must provide enough support so that even in tough areas, or badly gerrymandered districts, these candidates have the resources to get a message out._

Once again, this imperative carries major implications for every American who cares about democracy. It means that the battle over democracy is not just being waged within the state you live.

But in the community where you live. You are sitting right on the front line.

**Strategic Adjustment 4: _Local Offices_ Impact Democracy in Huge Ways.**

Once we reframe the battle as a long game for democracy, we immediately see the importance of offices up and down the ballot. Beyond statehouses.

And, no, this isn’t because these lower profile, local seats comprise the “bench” of people who might run for federal office some day. The fact that that’s how state and local offices are usually framed betrays Team D’s federal myopia once again.

Far beyond their impact on future federal elections, local offices are crucial in their own right. In the present. Now!

First, most play a direct role in the vitality of American democracy. Many local elections officials and clerks _are_ directly elected. A City Hall can shore up its constituents’ power in our democracy in countless ways—standing up for the very voters who are the prime targets of statehouse-led voter suppression. A school board that insists that its students learn the full, unvarnished truth about American history plays a critical part in a healthy democracy. Equally central are local judges, county commissioners, and other officials who, at key moments, make decisions over the rules guiding democracy in their respective communities. Appellate and state supreme courts often are the last protectors of a state’s democracy. Local prosecutors can hold officials accountable for wrongdoing or lawlessness, including when that lawlessness undermines democracy itself. And as one side is now trying to ban books and censor history, even the elected officials who appoint library boards are playing a key role in our democracy.

Beyond these offices’ direct impact on democracy, effective public service at these levels can provide a stark contrast to undemocratic and disconnected statehouses veering off into extreme directions. In 2019, for example, four Democratic candidates took on incumbent mayors in four small, rural Ohio towns Trump won handily in 2016: Archbold, Ironton, Norwalk, and Coshocton. Each ran on the fact that their towns were failing in too many ways. And each candidate won by 60 to 40 percent or better. Now they’re pushing for change in a way that dramatically contrasts with the work those communities’ legislators are doing at the statehouse.

Unlike the legislatures, most of these local races aren’t gerrymandered, so they’re more winnable. This also means they more accurately reflect these communities than statehouse incumbents cordoned off in rigged districts they know they’ll never lose. But that higher quality representation and service—that contrast—will never be on display if candidates don’t run for and win these offices in the first place.

_Bottom line: Many positions in politics play a sizeable role in our democracy—for good or for bad, depending on who occupies them. And they play a critical service role on so many issues that impact everyday Americans. The broader battle for democracy requires focus on all these offices—and not simply as steppingstones._

**Strategic Adjustment 5: _Always_ Fight for Democracy.**

I want to ban a term: “off-year” election.

It’s rare that a single hyphenated word can do so much damage—but this one does. It’s a full embrace of the federal election myopia that so undermines democracy. And it’s a frame that misleadingly signals to every voter. . . this election isn’t important.

Once you’ve reframed the battle of American politics as a battle over democracy itself, you realize that _every_ election matters, as explained in Adjustments 3 and 4.

Which also means _every year_ matters.

Even “midterm” understates what’s happening. What we call “midterms” are the years when most states elect all statewide officials and statehouses. If you’re in a battle over democracy, nothing matters more than those seats. There’s nothing “mid” about an election that shapes the democracy of your state, and the nation. That’s as “on” as it gets.

And the odd-numbered year isn’t an “off year” at all.

In most places, these years offer a chance to lift community in countless ways through municipal elections, or schools and students and teachers through school board elections, or improve safety and the justice system through judicial elections. All that is pretty “on” if you ask me, or most voters. Communities everywhere are in desperate need of good, capable, service-minded leaders. And each of these elected offices offers an opportunity for someone to perform public service and make a difference in the world. _Nothing_ matters more than that.

But way beyond the direct public service they provide, as described above, most of these offices also play a role in shaping democracy itself. Schools and city halls and courthouses all can lift democracy, or undermine it.

And it’s not just the offices and the power that they wield that matter, but the elections for those offices as well.

Well-run campaigns at any level enhance democracy. As Stacey Abrams understood in her Georgia work, every campaign, done right, is additive. Every door knock, every phone call, every vote, every petition signed—a new foundation to build upon. Each registered voter, each new voter, each inspired volunteer—“progress.” If a person votes in a local school board race in a so-called “off year,” and then in a statehouse race in the next year’s “midterm,” they’re far more likely to turn around and vote in a statehouse or congressional or presidential race two years later.

Along the way, that newly active voter just took herself off the “to be purged” list if she lives in Ohio, Georgia, Arizona, or another “use it or lose it” purging state. This is particularly important in the very communities where states are continuously purging voters from the rolls. A well-organized mayor or council campaign is a great vehicle to re-register voters that Ohio’s secretary of state is working feverishly to purge. Or to help that voter get the newly required photo ID. In short, participation in democracy builds on itself. Disengagement does as well.

Finally, outside of elections themselves, the work to protect democracy must _always_ be happening. “Off-year,” “midterm,” winter, spring—there is never a time we should _not_ be registering or engaging voters, or lifting democracy in other ways. Because of the scale of the task, and the scale of the _ongoing_ attack on democracy, so much of the most important work must be done before an election takes place. And after it is over.

You think Rhoda Denison Bement or civil rights leaders only got fired up come election time?

Of course not. The work must be done _all the time_. Especially when those attacking democracy do it full-time. (Do you think Steve Bannon and the Kochs shut things down for months after an election?)

Awaiting well-funded campaigns to magically emerge and do most of the work—registering and communicating with voters, inspiring them to join early vote lists, etc.—means you’ve waited too long. There aren’t enough resources and there’s not enough time to catch up to all the anti-democratic damage that’s been done in the meantime. Especially if you want to scale your fight to the level where it can change outcomes.

_Bottom line: Just as for those attacking democracy, when it comes to fighting for democracy, there is no “off” year. Or even “off” time._

**Strategic Adjustment 6: _Redefine_ the Teams.**

In 2020, Republicans did far better overall than Donald Trump did. They picked up US House seats and statehouse seats even in places where Trump himself lost. It was those wins that allowed them to attack democracy so fiercely in 2021 and 2022.

Why that mixed outcome in 2020?

Gerrymandering, of course, played a significant role. And because those attacking democracy prioritize state elections, you’d expect them to fare better at those levels.

Still, countless voters showed up and voted for Joe Biden for President, then voted Republican for the rest of the ticket.

Why?

One important reason is that many voters approached their ballot focused on one man: Trump. With a single question: were they for or against him? And many did so because they were using a frame given to them by commentators—and even Democratic candidates.

Not intentionally.

Maybe not even out loud.

But too many who care about democracy were blinded by their antipathy of Trump so that _he_ became the dividing line on the 2020 ballot—because almost everyone _made him_ the dividing line.

Some gave it a label: “Never-Trump.”

That meant politicians on the right who didn’t act like Trump or feel like Trump (and even many who did) scored millions of votes Trump himself didn’t get.

And what have most of those politicians done ever since?

They’ve gerrymandered the hell out of statehouses and Congress in a way that kept them in power after 2022. Suppressed voters. Conducted faux-“audits” of outcomes and spread “the big lie.” Passed extreme laws in state after state. In sum, they’ve worked feverishly to undermine democracy ever since their 2020 victories, where they received votes that Trump didn’t get. Many do all this more politely and with fewer tweets than Trump, but they do it all the same.

Viewing politics through the lens of Donald Trump is yet another result of not seeing America’s political battle as a deeper battle for democracy itself. To be blunt: the attack on democracy began long before Trump decided to run for president; yes, it got worse while he was president, but it would’ve continued in states either way; it would’ve continued if he had admitted he lost in 2020; and it _will_ continue if he were locked up tomorrow.

It’s so much bigger than Donald Trump.

Which means we have to change our current approach away from personality-driven frames like Never-Trump. We must stop spending our days obsessing only about the cartoonish DC villains like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert, or serial conmen like George Santos.

![[f062-1.jpg]]

It’s all too narrow a view—too short-term—of what’s happening in states. It over-focuses on the wrong place, and by doing so, lets too many off the hook who have voted and acted against democracy for years, are doing so right now, and will keep doing so. To be blunt—while not a single bill authored by MTG or Santos will become law in the next two years, hundreds of state legislators as extreme as they are are passing laws in states at a fever pitch with little to no sustained attention.

We risk making the same mistake as we enter the 2024 Presidential election, where some might view Trump as the only threat to democracy. Or, if Trump’s legal troubles finally catch up to him, the risk is that many breathe a sigh of relief as if the attack on democracy is over. When the truth is, it will continue unabated either way.

_Bottom Line: Team D needs to define itself (not necessarily as its message, but as its mindset) as Always-democracy. That’s what’s at stake in the coming elections. That’s what its team members stand for._

A deep commitment to democracy must be the dividing line. Are you for it or not? Do you want to stop attacks on voters, or don’t you? Do you want to win by rigging elections, or not?

Do you stand up against threats to democracy—such as supporting the January 6 Commission, protecting voting rights, or opposing faux election audits and book-banning—or not?

For those who do, embrace them as part of the pro-democracy effort even if major disagreements remain on other issues (which can be hashed out in fair elections).

But that genteel politician who posts friendly photos marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge while voting against democracy at every opportunity? Or writes op-eds bemoaning partisanship while rigging elections in backrooms? Or a GOP candidate for President with more discipline than Donald Trump, but who is banning books and publicly arresting voters? Or the legislator who began censoring history long before the idea ever occurred to Trump himself? Even if such people sound or feel nothing like Donald Trump, he or she is on the wrong team. Act accordingly.

Never Trump? Better than pro-Trump, but doesn’t tell me enough.

Never Democracy? Vote ’em out.

Always Democracy? Welcome aboard!

**Strategic Adjustment 7: _Accountability_ is Everything.**

America faces an accountability crisis.

Lack of accountability is fomenting both extremism and a breakdown in the rule of law at all levels.

In recent years, the most high-profile examples have occurred at the federal level. The Mueller report going nowhere. A phone call shaking down a foreign leader. . . nothing. Open violations of the Hatch Act and other forms of grotesque corruption. . . no consequences. People at the highest levels coordinating January 6. . . nothing, yet. House members voting not to certify the 2020 election protected from the voters through gerrymandering. Lawyers abusing the legal system. Classified documents at Mar-A-Lago. (We finally have an exception with the New York indictment of Donald Trump for hush money payments.)

And what we better learn from recent years is that those with a proclivity to act lawlessly, from Donald Trump on down, are not just relieved by lack of accountability, but _inspired_ by it. It not only spurs them to keep going, but to plunge further into extreme, lawless, and undemocratic behavior. To do it even faster. And they will keep going until they feel or fear real accountability.

Below the radar, this lack of accountability has reached a crisis point at the state level as well. And not by accident—it’s been built that way. Anchoring the success of those attacking democracy in states is that they’ve constructed and live within a political world devoid of accountability. Walled off from the voters, state-level politicians can push forward ever more aggressively without ever fearing consequences. It’s how they can openly defy the will of their voters—in pursuit of extremism and a deeply corrupted agenda—again and again. It’s how they defy the federal or state constitution or other laws or ethics rules with no repercussion.

And it’s why they never stop. When something works, they double down. When something fails, they learn from that failure and keep moving forward. And when statehouse officials with no accountability encounter other officials who themselves face moments of accountability (governors, secretaries of state), they run them over. With no accountability, they simply have no reason to ever back off. . . or slow down. It’s their superpower.

![[f066-1.jpg]]

_Bottom line: There is a desperate need to re-establish both legal and political accountability back into politics. Those fighting for democracy must pursue accountability measures at every level and in every way they can._

That covers the overall reframing we have to do: that we are in a battle for democracy itself. And those are the seven strategic adjustments we must make.

Now that we have that broader frame set, here comes the most important part: where you fit in.Chapter 3:  
**Scaling Up: Dedicating Your Entire Footprint to Fight for Democracy**

Freedom is not a state; it is an act. It is not some enchanted garden perched high on a distant plateau where we can finally sit down and rest. Freedom is the continuous action we all must take, and each generation must do its part to create an even more fair, more just society.

—John Lewis

Don’t skip or speed-read that quote.

Go back. Take it in. Every word.

John Lewis, the Congressman and civil rights hero, repeated them often. And while he uses the word “freedom” in the quote, go ahead and add the word democracy.

Democracy, too, is not a state. “It is an act.” Fighting for freedom and democracy requires “continuous action.” He’s describing the _long battle_ I described in the Introduction, and again in Chapter 2.

As Lewis says, you actually never reach an end point—there’s not some magical moment where you “sit down and rest” as if it’s settled once and for all. Because it never is. Democracy is always contested. Always has been.

And he knew the struggle required a commitment to democracy _everywhere_, and at every level.

He knew it involved action “_we all_ must take.” Success relies on continuous action from _everyone_.

That “action” was John Lewis’s life. Inspiring others to join him in that action was his life.

And his quote is not only about his struggle in the past. It’s about now. He’s talking to us.

So what is John Lewis telling _us_ to do _now_?

That we must make it our life as well.

“We all.” That includes _you_.

John Lewis is also stressing that we—that _you_—are the center of the American fight for freedom. For democracy.

Every reader. Everyone you know. You’re the key.

So, that’s his lesson. And the good news is that it’s so clear.

But what’s the bad news—in the year 2023? Or 2024?

It’s that “_we all_” are not doing enough.

No doubt, you are working hard. After all, you’re reading this.

But there’s also no doubt that you’re frustrated at the lack of progress in our fight for freedom and democracy. After all, you’re reading this.

That lack of progress tells you and me something important. That what we are doing, collectively, is not enough.

We may be working hard, but it’s not at the scale that we need to succeed. And it’s not strategic enough, against a group—Team A—which is not only working tirelessly, but working _highly_ strategically, and at an incredibly large scale. For them, attacking democracy is a billion-dollar enterprise, it’s full-time, and whenever they can, they put the full power and authority of _government_ behind it. They put the _law_ behind it. They invest your tax dollars in it!

![[f071-1.jpg]]

Up against that massive effort, I fear that if we don’t change what we’re doing, it will never be enough. And my guess is you, too, know that’s the reality.

So let’s do things a little differently, shall we?

And fast.

**Time to Force Multiply**

But before we go big—and get to where and how we can all work more strategically _together—_we have to look at what _more_ we can _each_ do.

To paraphrase Carly Simon, this chapter _is about you_. Yes, be vain for the next few pages, because we’re going to take an intense look just at you.

I’m going to challenge every reader to think about what you’ve been doing to lift democracy in your life, and what more you _can_ do beyond what you’re doing.

This is critical because to overcome the immense scale of the attack _against_ democracy, “we all” are going to have to scale up our individual effort, then combine those efforts together into a hugely scaled collective effort.

To say it differently—Stacey Abrams and Michelle Obama and different parties and advocacy groups and candidates are all going to do some heroic things to lift our democracy. But you and I can’t simply wait for them to save us while you and I do the same thing we’ve always done. That’s not gonna cut it.

“We all” have to scale it up in our own lives, as John Lewis instructed us to.

And that means you, the reader, have to scale it up.

And the first and biggest step you can take is a shift in your mindset. There’s one simple decision you must make.

Here it is: **incorporate “saving democracy” into your _personal mission statement_.**

If you’re reading this anywhere near January, make it one of your new year’s resolutions. If it’s July, resolve to do it for the second half of the year and then keep going into the new year.

Just do it.

And how does that one shift make a difference?

If done right, it exponentially scales up your efforts. To borrow from the military, you’re force multiplying.

Too vague?

Don’t worry—this chapter is going to walk you through exactly how it works, starting with the most powerful (and under-utilized) asset in the battle for democracy:

**Your Footprint in the World**

We all have a footprint in this world. YOU have a footprint of impact and influence.

It’s a combination of the many communities you’re a part of and the many things you do. Every day. Every week.

Let’s look at the core elements of your footprint.

![[f074-1.jpg]]

It starts with your family. And it includes your neighborhood. Your church. Your workplace. Your schools (present or past), or your kids’ schools. Maybe your gym, or the restaurant or coffee shop you go to most days. It includes organizations and civic activities you’re a part of—as a volunteer and supporter, or member. These days, for many, your social media activity is part of your footprint as well.

Most of you dedicate something tangible to each element of your footprint.

What, specifically? What do you each “_have_” that you can dedicate to these elements?

Here are a few:

•  your hard work

•  your time

•  your intellect

•  your financial resources (including dollars you spend and give)

•  your reputation and credibility

•  your networks

•  your voice/communications

•  your passion

•  your creativity

•  other skills you’ve developed

and more.

So, you each have a footprint, and you have personal assets and resources you dedicate to the many elements of that footprint.

Now, let’s see where your _political activity_ fits into your footprint. It’s a wide spectrum, of course.

Most Americans’ sole form of political participation is voting. Many vote, many don’t, and it fluctuates by the year. Beyond voting, most don’t participate in our democracy. For them, neither political activity nor lifting democracy is part of their footprint at all. (As wild as 2016 was politically, one study found that less than 4 percent of Americans did any work for a campaign or party that year—a marked decline from prior decades. The number was 17 percent in 1964.)[^10]

![[f076-1.jpg]]

For most whose political involvement _does_ go beyond voting, the activity remains minimal. Maybe they donate some support to a candidate running for office. Or, like that 4 percent in 2016, volunteer a few times in a campaign, or put up a yard sign for one hundred days. Helpful, but still not enough to register even as an element in their footprint. Maybe a toe or two are involved, but that’s it.

![[f077-1.jpg]]

For those rare Americans whose political involvement is more substantial—my guess is if you’re reading this book, that may include you—that activity _does_ amount to an element of your footprint. To use my list above, it most naturally falls into your “other organizations and civic activities” bucket. Or perhaps it falls into your neighborhood/community bucket. Either way, it’s one other element of your footprint. Your big toe is now in on the action. Or your heel. But not close to the whole footprint.

![[f077-2.jpg]]

Even then, most keep that political activity separate from others. It’s an extra meeting on a weekend morning, or weekday evening. It’s an extra Zoom call, or event we attend. It’s a Facebook page we visit and occasionally comment on. A few hours of volunteering here and there, usually close to election time. We rarely let politics spill over into other things we do, in part because incorporating our politics into other elements feels like an unwelcome intrusion. Uncomfortable. Awkward.

And when we engage in that political activity, we usually dedicate just a handful of our assets to it. For the most part, our time and resources, mixed in with some level of passion. By volunteering. Supporting candidates financially. Perhaps using our communications skills (making phone calls, writing postcards, posting online, etc.).

Of course, the most energetic political activists do more than this. For you, it’s a bigger and more important part of your footprint, and you draw upon more of your personal assets to do this work. Lots of time. Lots of passion. Lots of communicating. More financial support. You tap into your network. Especially around peak election time. Well done!

![[f078-1.jpg]]

But here’s my observation. And my fear.

It’s still not enough.

The sum total of individual involvement I’ve just described is not enough to save democracy. Too few people participate at all. Too few include political activity as even an element in their footprint. And for those rare people who do, most _only_ include politics as just another discrete element in their footprint—and the activity ebbs and flows depending on campaign cycles. Which still doesn’t lift it high enough. Not even close.

It’s not incorporated enough into all that we do. We don’t scale it enough.

So how does incorporating “saving democracy” into your personal mission statement change that?

First, framing the activity as “saving democracy” eliminates the hesitance to incorporate it into other things we do. Imagined, executed, and communicated correctly, it takes it from partisan to patriotic.

Second, even for those who participate in politics, it takes the activity from something we do sporadically—around certain political campaigns and years—into something we do all the time. As John Lewis did. As Rhoda Denison Bement did.

Third, and most importantly, once we make it a core part of our mission, we prioritize “saving democracy” beyond being just _another_ thing we do—a discrete element of our footprint. It becomes part of _everything_ we do, as it must.

Why is this so powerful? I’ll address that in a moment, with examples. But let me cover one other piece of ground first.

**What Does Saving Democracy Involve?**

When I talk about saving democracy, what types of things am I talking about? I’ll offer numerous examples throughout the book of ways to lift democracy, but an overview with practical examples now is helpful.

The first step of lifting democracy is at its entry point—registering voters, one American at a time. And non-stop registration is doubly important when state after state is using various tools to purge thousands or millions of voters from the rolls. To reduce the size of the electorate, and reshape it along the way. But depending on your state and the rules in your state, registration is _just_ the first step. Too many people register to vote and then never actually vote, so registration must be just the beginning of the ongoing engagement. Other steps include encouraging voters to request vote-by-mail ballots, or sign up to be on their state’s “early voter” lists, or reminding people to vote close to election day—and how they can do so, early if possible. (I go through all this in more detail in the next chapter.)

The activity I’m mentioning here is not partisan, and it’s not about a particular candidate. There’s nothing partisan about urging participation in our democracy; in fact, that’s as patriotic as it gets. So, there’s no reason to be shy about doing so in all sorts of places and venues.

Of course, another big part of saving democracy _is_ more political. More partisan—sometimes, intensely so. This includes recruiting, training, and supporting pro-democracy candidates for offices up and down the ballot. Organizing and inspiring voters to support these candidates. Taking direct actions to hold officials accountable, or placing referenda on the ballot to directly change laws. Protecting voters and elections processes.

These and other actions are also key steps to saving democracy. We’ll also review them later in more detail.

**Force Multiplying: Using Your Entire Footprint to Save Democracy**

But for now, let’s return to your new commitment **to incorporate “saving democracy” into your personal mission statement.**

By doing so, you just incorporated that new mission across your entire footprint. Political activity isn’t just another activity you do. Saving democracy occupies the core of who you are. You use your entire footprint to get it done.

![[f081-1.jpg]]

By doing that, you are challenging yourself to help save democracy _in every single thing_ you do—no longer just confined to the political activity you separate from everything else. Instead, you now examine every element of your footprint, and add any and all of the above steps to protect democracy whenever you can, however you can. You incorporate them into the “bloodstream” of all or most of your other activities, all the time.

That simple adjustment puts our individual and collective pro-democracy efforts on steroids. It’s a personal force multiplier for democracy, with explosive consequences. (It’s also what the other side is doing.)

A simple analogy underscores the potential impact of this shift:

When Congress passed the Motor Voter Law in the 1990s, staid and boring motor vehicle bureaus around the country suddenly shouldered a critical new mission: registering voters—lifting democracy. Ever since, staff are required to ask all visitors if they would like to register to vote. Overall registrations spiked shortly after the law took effect. And now, millions register or update their registrations through the bureau, due to those simple staff questions.

Why so many? And why register voters at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and not, say, create separate Voter Registration Centers all over communities?

Because in our car-dominated world, these bureaus and their hard-working public servants already interact with millions of Americans every day as part of those visitors’ regular course of business. Customers are walking in for a reason besides politics—often because they have to. Add it all up, and the _BMV has one enormous footprint_. So, adding voter registration to the BMV’s core mission, when the BMV and its workers’ collective footprints include engaging with millions of people who pass through for other reasons, provides a huge boost to democracy.

Simple.

But that begs two questions.

First, for _everyone_: where else could we add saving democracy as a core mission? Take a moment and think of every place and institution in your community that already engage people for other reasons.

Second, for _you_: which activities in _your_ life could do the same thing?

Go back to your own footprint. With your new core mission of saving democracy in mind, think of all the activities you do on a daily basis that overlap with everyday people. Think about which institutions or groups or causes you engage with, which themselves engage people as part of _their_ everyday life. (We’ll write all this down in the coming chapters.)

Your job in a restaurant. At a store. At a law firm. In a doctor’s office. At a social service agency.

Your participation at your kids’ school.

Your volunteer work at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter.

A nonprofit board you serve on.

Your union local.

Your tenant association or community group.

These are all elements in your footprint.

Can they play a role to help save democracy? Can they add saving democracy to their core mission? The answer is almost always going to be yes.

Just one example shows how easy it is:

When the COVD-19 pandemic first hit in 2020, I chaired the Ohio Democratic Party. While registering voters was a critical need, we could no longer do our traditional in-person voter registration work. So I asked the staff member who was in charge of that work—Vashitta Johnson—to come up with an alternative way to register voters. And, boy, did she!

Vashitta knocked on the doors of restaurants, coffee shops, and other small businesses in Columbus and other Ohio cities who were still serving customers. These were largely cold calls. And she asked these businesses to consider including voter registration materials on-site, and encouraging their customers to register to vote. We called them “voter registration hubs.”

And without hesitation, most signed on as hubs. Then went further. Many took ownership of their new pro-democracy mission, not only by helping customers register, but then bringing completed forms to boards of elections and requesting new forms when they ran out. And they began spreading the word to other small businesses, calling Vashitta every time a new “hub” had signed on. It took on a life of its own.

Imagine how many people these restaurants and small businesses engage with over time just through their daily course of business. And now think about how much these restaurant owners empowered voters, one person at a time, when each decided to add saving democracy to her footprint. (Far more than if they had kept their political activity separate, by, for example, registering voters a few hours every weekend as part of a political group.)

In your job, in the other roles you play in life, ask yourself how you can do the same thing.

But don’t stop there.

Now think of places where you donate money, or spend money? Or volunteer time?

Charities you give to. Restaurants you frequent. Where you get your hair cut.

Are these institutions saving democracy as part of their core mission? If not, why not? They should be.

Again, Vashitta knocked on the doors of strangers and asked, and most said yes. Once she did, they took the idea and ran with it. If you’re a regular at a certain restaurant or coffee shop, you can do the same thing.

Next, think of other _relationships_ you have.

Who’s in your network? Friends. Family. Colleagues. Book club compatriots. School alumni. Fraternity brothers or sorority sisters. Union brothers and sisters.

What institutions fall within _their_ footprints?

What public-facing services are they involved with?

To get specific:

Do you happen to know the mayor or newly elected member of City Hall or County Commission?

Do you know a member of the school or library board? Or a museum?

Do you know someone who runs a restaurant, or sits on the board of a nonprofit, or is involved in public housing?

Can they add saving democracy to their core mission, or that of those organizations?

Ask them, just like Vashitta did.

And if they’re not, ask them why not? Because they definitely should be.

Like those restaurants, far more than most political groups we may be part of, so many institutions in your or your network’s footprints are engaging a far greater stream of people over the course of their regular business. So once we add “saving democracy” to the bloodstream of what these institutions do, and what their workers do, it scales up fast. Their footprints are put to work for democracy.

As I’ll explain below, it’s even more powerful when you enlist the places that engage the very people whose voices are being _subverted_ by voter suppression. For example, the businesses Vashitta enlisted were largely minority-owned businesses, serving an urban customer base, so their lift to democracy was especially important given that urban Ohioans have been the target of intense voter purging.

And again, the activity I’m mentioning here is largely nonpartisan. It’s not about a certain candidate. There’s nothing partisan about urging participation in our democracy. So there’s no reason to be shy about proposing it in your workplace. Or where you workout.

In fact, for organizations that care about their workers or constituents or customers, they should _want_ to do it. It _should_ be part of their mission statement—not just because it’s part of being an American, and good for democracy, but because it is in their organization’s interest, and their constituents’ interest, to maximize their representation in our democracy. That’s a big reason those restaurants signed on.

Of course, there are political and partisan activities you can also add to your footprint once you’ve made the commitment that saving democracy is part of your core mission. I’ll walk through more of those in future chapters too.

But the key point for now is that the first big step you need to take to fight for democracy is to add “saving democracy” to your core mission statement, and then brainstorm every way that the people and places and institutions in your footprint can do the same. My guess is you’ll discover you have a far greater potential to lift democracy than you’ve ever realized.

The diagram below starts the process of you doing this—later chapters will guide you as you complete your plan.

As you work through it, identify the central elements of your footprint. Then brainstorm what interactions each element has with people as part of their regular course of business.

Then for each element, and for the remainder of this book, we’ll build your plan from that worksheet. You’ll write in which specific voter engagement activity can be done within each element of your footprint. You can do the same things that Vashitta did, across your entire footprint.

**(Re-)Engaging Voters on a Massive Scale**

Now many of our Christians have what I call the ‘goo-goo syndrome.’ Good government. They want everybody to vote. I don’t want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of people. They never have been from the beginning of our country, and they are not now. As a matter of fact our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.[^11]

—Paul Weyrich, 1980

[E]verybody shouldn’t be voting. . . . Quantity is important, but we have to look at the quality of votes, as well.[^12]

—Rep. John Kavanagh, (R-AZ), 2021

They’re not hiding it.

Read that quote again: “As a matter of fact our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up _as the voting populace goes down._”

This wasn’t a secret memo. It was said as part of a speech, in the wide open.

So no, they’re not hiding it. A core strategy in the attack on democracy is to enact policies at the state level that keep people from voting.

But the goal isn’t simply a smaller electorate. It’s a _different_ electorate. A nonrepresentative electorate. A less diverse electorate. Which is why the measures have disproportionately disenfranchised voters who are part of the broad and diverse majority that people like Weyrich fear will be in the driver’s seat of American democracy if they fully participate.

They are suppressing, as best they can, _the Obama coalition_, and successive generations. Why? Because in 2008, that diverse and modern and representative coalition—anchored in Black voters and other voters of color—knocked them out of power everywhere. Not just at the White House, but in statehouses all over the country. And it was a wakeup call to the far right to do what Weyrich had urged them to do.

So as soon as they got the chance, they went to work.

The scale of the disenfranchisement strategy since has been enormous. It’s full-time. It’s big money. It’s the government itself. And with persistence, precision, creativity, and gobsmacking cynicism, it’s been brutally effective.

In some states the suppression takes the form of massive, ongoing **purging** of voters. Millions of voters removed from the rolls in states like Ohio and Georgia. Removed not because they moved or passed away, but because the government decreed that they don’t vote frequently enough. Unless they figure it out and re-register in time, these purged voters are turned away at the next election. (In _Laboratories of Autocracy_, I show how this purging process alone has decimated the Obama coalition in the urban centers of Ohio—shrinking the population of registered voters in our largest blue counties even as the population of those counties, together, has _grown_.)

In other states, the disenfranchisement comes through ever more **strict voter ID laws**. Yes, most people have some form of photo identification, but recent laws narrow which photo IDs are recognized. For too many who lack those specific IDs, and particularly those who lead challenging lives, the dollars to spend or miles to travel or hoops to jump through to obtain the required form of ID keep them from voting. In some states, this has led to hundreds of thousands of fewer voters—in Wisconsin, the number of people disenfranchised by the strict photo ID law surpassed Trump’s margin of victory in 2016. And as with purging and other suppression tactics, those disenfranchised disproportionately include voters of color and young voters. (No accident, many states refuse to accept student IDs.)

In still other states, it’s been the **rolling back of early vote** opportunities that expanded the electorate, and which voters of color disproportionally utilize. These new limitations often come immediately after elections where those voters participated in large numbers. Attacks on early vote in 2011 (the first opportunity after the Obama victory); bans on drop boxes in 2021.

And elsewhere, there are growing efforts to **intimidate voters** from participating. Intimidation by the government itself, such as high-profile arrests guaranteed to make the evening news. And by private, organized efforts to challenge voters’ eligibility or sit in front of drop boxes, armed with guns—_resources/books//Saving Democracy_ A User's Manual for Ever - David Pepper right out of the dawn of Jim Crow.

![[f094-1.jpg]]

Then there’s one final factor fueling disenfranchisement, which comes from an unexpected place: **modern campaign tactics**. To cost-efficiently expend precious dollars, campaigns and most political organizations hyper-target the voters they now reach out to. This means that once voters are no longer on the rolls, they are left unengaged by a political world doubtful they will show up, and therefore unwilling to make an investment to re-engage them. In a sad irony, Team A’s _government_ strategy of pushing voters off the rolls is rewarded by Team D’s _political_ strategy, which removes those voters from the entire political conversation. That’s right—the standard political response to the shrinking of the rolls is to _accept_ those smaller rolls as the new electorate.

Combine all this together, and we’re seeing the emergence of _two separate Americas_. Not red versus blue. But one that’s politically involved, and one that’s _not_ involved. How big is the latter? In 2020, the “not involved” portion comprised a staggering eighty million people. And in 2022, JD Vance won an Ohio Senate seat with 23.9 percent of Ohio’s eligible population voting for him. Mike DeWine won his governor’s seat in a blow-out, but only garnered 28 percent of the population’s vote.

![[f095-1.jpg]]

And again, those non-voting Americans disproportionately hail from the diverse majority—voters of color, young voters, low-income voters—that made up the Obama coalition and successive generations.[^13] Specifically, in red states (which have aggressively pursued those suppression tactics), Black voter registration and voting both declined between 2008 and 2020, while white registration and voting rose in those same states. Compare that to blue states in the same time period, where Black registration and turnout both rose.[^14] The suppression is hitting its intended target.

![[f096-1.jpg]]

The “loss” of these voters from the political world bears an enormous impact on politics and democracy. It alters outcomes, changes the conversation, and impacts policy. And in many places, it transforms who the voting majority actually is. Which, going back to Weyrich, is the entire point.

**What to Do? Re-Engage**

Given the scale of the ongoing attack on the electorate, those of us who care about democracy face a crucial mission. And as I explained in Chapter 2, it’s a mission that’s on our shoulders all the time—before campaigns take place, right after they end, and all times in between. It’s a mission far _bigger_ than campaigns. . .

_We must re-engage the millions of Americans_ who are currently not involved in politics. We must engage those who will be disenfranchised this year, or next year, or the year after, due to the ongoing, full-time, big dollar, and government-led effort to push them and keep them off voting rolls. And we must engage the sporadic voters who are at continuous risk of full disengagement.

Importantly, this re-engagement isn’t only about voter registration, where efforts today too often begin and end. It’s about driving a never-ending cycle of engagement that includes the following steps:

1. Register Voters. All the Time.

Step one in lifting democracy is registering voters on a mass scale. And to do this far more than we do today.

The good news is that registering voters is quick, easy, can be accomplished online in most states, and requires limited experience or training for those doing registration work.

The bad news is that the scale of what we need to do is enormous. Which means simply registering voters amid campaigns and late in big campaign years is important, but not nearly enough. Leaving it to _only_ campaigns and political organizations is not enough. Leaving it just to volunteers is not enough. Leaving it to weekends and large rallies is not enough.

If we are to match the massive scale of the effort to shrink the electorate, re-registering all the lost voters must occur every day, everywhere. It must become part of the daily stream of interactions we all go through every day.

How? I’ll get to that below. But let me first tell you what _else_ we have to do.

2. Engagement _After_ Registration.

Registration can’t be the end of the engagement, as it too often is. It’s just the beginning.

Once registered, individual voters must be regularly engaged about the value and importance of the political and voting process going forward. And this engagement should not only be about federal and presidential elections, but education about all the races and issues that are on the ballot in all cycles, and how they impact issues people care about.

We have to get voters in the habit of voting at _every opportunity_—which includes the next election, at whatever level it may be, and however it impacts voters’ lives. The less transactional this engagement is, the better. The more community-based, the better. Center it around the voter and the issues he or she cares about, while getting feedback on those issues.

As we’ll discuss in Chapter 7, this is not simply a “get out the vote” process—this is a constant effort at persuasion. _Persuading_ folks who haven’t been in the political world for some time that it’s worth getting back in. A last-minute, frantic knock on the door or impersonal phone call or text is not very persuasive if someone has decided voting doesn’t matter.

3. Overcoming Obstacles to Voting

Unfortunately, the more difficult one’s life is in today’s hectic world, the more challenging the obstacles to voting become. The need for a limited type of photo ID in some states keeps hundreds of thousands of voters from participating, because the logistics and cost needed to get that ID get in the way. In other states, those returning back into the community after serving time either are intimidated from voting because they are confused about the law, or have to undertake certain steps to properly cast a ballot. High-profile efforts to crack down on “voter fraud” dissuade these voters from re-entering our democratic process.

Assisting voters in overcoming these hurdles well in advance of elections is another critical part of engagement.

4. Early Vote

As election cycles near, another key step along the spectrum of voter engagement is communicating to as many voters as possible about the opportunity to vote early, and helping them do so. This includes the opportunity to **request a vote-by-mail ballot** or where and how to **vote early, in-person**. In some states, it includes adding oneself to the **list of voters who receive that ballot** for every election.

5. Vote on Election Day

Finally, all voters should be reminded of the importance of election day itself, and the logistics of successfully casting that vote. Unlike the usual campaign cycle, this can’t be the first time a voter is hearing about the election, but the last of a long series of respectful communications.

6. Post-Election Communication

Following an election, the engagement must continue unabated. We can’t return to a cycle of last-minute pleas followed by two years of silence followed by more last-minute pleas. Again, that’s not a meaningful conversation with voters. Often, it’s viewed as disrespectful—because it so often is.

**How? Start with Your Footprint**

So that’s a quick snapshot of key interactions in the ongoing engagement of voters that must take place.

I know what you’re thinking. That I’ve just outlined an enormous and unachievable task. _How can one organization, be it a political party or campaign, grow so large that it takes on such an imposing amount of work year after year?_

To which I say: forget political organizations for a second. I’m not talking about them.

I’m asking _you_ to do the engagement work I just described. Yes, you, the reader. Because that’s the only way this is going to happen at a scale large enough to matter.

How? This is where the footprint model from the previous chapter makes its return.

We must all—individually, organizationally—take every aspect of our own footprints and use them to engage voters in all the ways I’ve described. And if our individual footprints form the building blocks of this engagement, we can do it.

Let me give a few examples:

Footprint 1: Family and Friends

![[f101-1.jpg]]

Meet Ebony DeLoach.

Ebony is forty-five years old and lives in the Bond Hill/Roselawn area, working class neighborhoods north of Cincinnati. Heading into 2022, Ebony worried about the political disengagement she was seeing within her immediate community, and decided to do something about it. But she decided to go beyond the traditional voter registration work she’d done in the past.

With the assistance of the Ohio Organizing Collaborative, Ebony dedicated a far larger part of her footprint to the effort than she ever had in the past. Let’s call it the “friends and family” approach.

She started with family—three generations of DeLoaches, from their twenties to their sixties. Specifically, she called upon her mother, Helen; her sister, Evelyn; her fiancé, Jermaine Crunchfield; and her daughters, Ebony and Michelle, to work with her. From that nucleus, each member of Team DeLoach reached out to their personal networks about the importance of engaging in the political process. They talked to their friends, work colleagues, neighbors, and others in their network, some of whom did the same with their networks. And it grew from there. Everyone in the wide network they constructed was called a “democracy builder.”

Importantly, their conversations went far beyond simply urging people to register to vote. Each conversation involved explaining why being politically involved was “something that matters to them,” giving very specific reasons why others should get involved. Why it would make a difference in their lives if they did so. Because that local judge will decide X. Because that councilman will decide Y. They had these conversations through the summer and fall.

The Ohio Organizing Collaborative tracked what Ebony and her family managed to put together. Thousands of contacts, many young people, almost entirely Black. The OOC also cross-referenced these contacts with the database of voters that traditional campaigns would use, and found that many of these folks were NOT on those voter lists. Because their starting point was their own networks and not a top-down political list, the DeLoaches were reaching thousands of “unengaged” voters, otherwise left out of the political conversation. The OOC also found that many people that the DeLoaches engaged ended up having multiple reinforcing conversations within the network the family had built, further deepening the overall engagement.

Bottom line: Ebony passionately and smartly used the “family and friends” element of her footprint to lift democracy, and in the process sparked authentic engagement on a massive scale, and with voters too often left out of the political conversation.

You can do the same. Everyone you know can do the same.[^15]

Footprint 2: Where You Serve People

![[f104-1.jpg]]

Remember Vashitta Johnson? And how she engaged Ohio restaurants to register voters, and how they eagerly did so?

Now imagine if folks who owned or worked in restaurants like these took up, in creative ways, most of the steps in the process I described above. They _could_ undertake most of them. They just haven’t thought it’s something they should do. And since they’re in the business of serving people, if they _did_ take up many of those steps, it would make an enormous difference in lifting voters back into democracy.

How big a difference?

Here’s one example: when current Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown served as Ohio’s secretary of state, he worked with McDonald’s restaurants across the state to include a voter registration form on _every food tray_. Now _that_ is scaling up the effort to engage voters.

Here’s another: during the pandemic, Kroger placed an early vote kiosk in each of its store’s lobbies, so customers could take a form to request to vote early after checking out. That too is _scaling_ up big time.

Let me give another example, beyond where we eat or shop.

In 2021, my friend Kim Thomas was elected mayor of Richmond Heights, a city outside Cleveland. In 2019, she’d stunned the political establishment when she first won her council seat—the first Black woman and Democrat to win that district—and then rose to mayor two years later, only the second woman elected to serve in that post.

I _wasn’t_ stunned. I was confident she’d win. Because I’d witnessed Kim lifting democracy for years.

I first met Kim when she ran a hair salon in Cleveland. And with repeat customers and lots of opportunity for personal conversations, Kim understood that she had a robust footprint to lift democracy. So she used her footprint to do exactly that.

She engaged in conversations with her clients about why voting mattered, and registered any unregistered clients. But she didn’t stop there. Part of a broader network of Cleveland hair salons, Kim convinced many others to join her effort. Day in and day out, Kim’s network of salons and stylists would sign on dozens of new voters as part of their regular course of business.

Kim went on to be a candidate and officeholder—but she and _all_ of those salon owners and stylists were already playing heroic roles in our democracy. And it started because they, one person at a time, decided to add lifting democracy to their core missions. They put their footprints to work for democracy.

Now imagine if along the way, Kim and other salons registered voters, then informed voters about the identification requirements needed to vote, then informed voters about how to vote early, then reminded voters about election day.

Think about how many voters that would impact. Now _that_ is scaling it up.

Are you in a service business like Kim’s? Do you run a restaurant or coffee shop? Do you work at one? That’s a powerful part of your footprint. Could you add these types of engagements as part of your service to your customers?

Or are you a regular customer at a salon like Kim’s, or a restaurant? That too is part of your footprint. Is that salon or restaurant lifting democracy like Kim or her network did? If not, ask them to consider it, just like Vashitta did. And remember, Vashitta’s were cold calls and most still said yes. They quickly took ownership of the work. If you’re a regular, you already have a relationship that makes that “yes” even more likely.

Footprint 3: Where You Live

![[f107-1.jpg]]

Around the same time that Vashitta was engaging those restaurants, another of my favorite pro-democracy innovations popped up. . . in people’s yards.

In Columbus suburbs, activists added visible boxes in their front yards (or in other strategic spots, like near bus stops or intersections) that looked like mailboxes. But they were more colorful—red, white, and blue—and included a simple sign: “Register here.” Inside were voter registration forms that passersby could take with them. Many had QR codes on them that people could scan to register on the spot.

Good!

But I’ll go one better.

If you ever knock on doors like I did as a candidate, or more recently as a volunteer, you notice something immediately. Something both frustrating and sobering.

Of the houses you visit, most residents are registered, and vote at least sporadically. Many vote every election. Following the campaign’s guidance, you always knock on these doors. If they’re not home, you leave a reminder to vote. And another volunteer will likely call or knock on that same door later to make sure they got the message.

But when you come upon apartment buildings, even though countless Americans live within, you usually walk right by. Compared to their homeowner neighbors, the residents inside are often people of less means—many living on the edge. Most move a lot. And in states like Ohio, they are the most likely to be purged from the rolls.

![[f108-1.jpg]]

Since these folks are unregistered or only vote sporadically, the campaign and their data-crunchers—under limited budgets and limited time—instruct their volunteers or staff to walk right by. They’re not on the walk list. So, no knock. No conversation. No note. No calls. Which only makes the problem worse.

Those skipped addresses and buildings provide a stark reminder of the downward spiral of disengagement—an entire world of people, many in need, removed from politics. It’s a crisis for American democracy, one which the political machinery largely declines to solve.

But it’s one that _you_ can help solve.

Are you a resident in an apartment building such as this? Is a relative, or a friend, or someone where you work? Then you or they have a powerful footprint you could use to lift democracy—to fill the void left by the budget-crunching political operatives.

Through a small amount of work and creativity, you could create the equivalent of that “registration box” in that skipped building. In a larger building, recruit someone to do the work for each floor. You could lift dozens or hundreds of people into our democracy, so that all those newly registered residents will show up on those walk lists forever more. You could explain to every resident how to vote early, and how to get the early vote application and fill it out. Anytime a new resident moves into an apartment on your floor, you could welcome them by making sure they’ve updated their registration, then know about the opportunity to vote early. Tell them: “we all vote here.”

By doing all that, you likely just ensured that future campaigns won’t skip them in the next election. And if someone now knocks on their door from a campaign (or maybe that’s _you_ knocking on that door), or calls them, data tells us they are far more likely to vote.

Are you in a tenant association in any such buildings? Or do you know someone who is? Or are you part of a nonprofit that serves residents of those buildings, like Meals on Wheels? Does any part of your footprint overlap with organizations that impact these residents?

If the answer is yes, then you have a powerful footprint from which to lift democracy. And to lift the very people who too often are not engaged in our democracy.

Go do it!

Footprint 4: Where You Work

![[f110-1.jpg]]

My wife, Alana, grew up in in rural Adams County, an hour east of Cincinnati and the Western edge of Appalachia. After graduating from North Adams High School, she worked her way through the University of Cincinnati. That work started with babysitting, daycare, and restaurant jobs, but later—both before and after graduating—she worked her way up jobs in the mental health field. First as a receptionist, then as an administrative assistant, then as an executive assistant, then as an auditor of various mental health programs.

When we first married, Alana was the coordinator of a project that brought physical health interventions to those being treated for mental health. (Americans with mental health challenges have a far shorter life expectancy, often because many of their physical ailments are overlooked, or exacerbated by their treatment.)

So in her work, Alana and a team of clinicians and specialists interacted with hundreds of clients on a weekly basis. Her agency interacted with thousands of clients overall.

Want an example of a robust footprint that could lift democracy? It turns out (and it didn’t occur to us at the time), Alana had a huge one, and it encompassed a large group of Americans who almost never vote. Adding simple pro-democracy steps—registration, early vote applications, election day reminders—to the repeated interactions she and her agency had with these clients could’ve lifted them all to participate in our democracy.

Another example.

I got to know a group of amazing Ohio doctors during the pandemic. We called upon them to regularly inform folks how to stay safe. They would hop on Zoom calls, scrubs on, then hop off to go save a life or help a patient. It was our honor to get to know them.

It turns out, these doctors also believed passionately in democracy, so much so that they joined a national program called Vot-ER. It’s simple, but effective: on the back of each doctor’s badge, they’ve added a QR code linking directly to a website where patients can register to vote. They ask every patient if they’re registered, and if they’re not, they ask them if they want to scan the code and get registered. Now that’s powerful. That’s scale.

Like Alana and these doctors, many in the social service field—homeless shelters, soup kitchens, medical facilities, etc.—share a similar footprint that can easily be converted into lifting democracy. Still, far too few of these organizations or the heroic folks who work at them ever do so, even though they’re serving the very people most likely to be kicked out, then left out, of the political conversation. Just like those apartment buildings.

If you work in such a field—or even donate, volunteer, or serve on a board of such organizations—let’s change that!

Footprint 5: Social Media

![[f112-1.jpg]]

These days, most steps to enlist in our democracy are only a click and a few keystrokes away. Worst case, they involve a click, a few days’ wait, then a pen and a stamp.

Either way, that means that everyone can get started through their phones and computers. It also means that everyone can _encourage_ others to do so using the same devices. Once again, your footprint should make this easy.

Most people are on social media. Of those who are, Facebook still dominates, although younger generations are flocking to new platforms. Wherever you engage on social media, that part of your footprint is an efficient place to lift democracy. And I’m not talking about getting into partisan fights with endless arguments and insults back and forth. If that’s your thing, great. (More on that later too.) But you can lift democracy in simpler ways.

Specifically, most states allow for online voter registration, and allow people to check their registration status online. Others allow people to request early-vote applications online. And so on. And the links to do this are easy to find.

Posting a small reminder to your friends and followers to check their voter registration, and including that link on how to register, or request a vote-by-mail ballot, can go a long way. Better yet, encourage them to share that information with their friends and followers.

And if you have kids or friends or colleagues on different platforms than you’re on, give them the same information and ask them to do the same on those platforms. We need young people involved, using their voices and the voices of those _they_ know, communicating in the ways _they know_ are most effective.

Or if your workplace or an organization where you volunteer has an active social media presence, ask them to do the same with their workers or clients or constituents.

In the fall of 2022, one institution did a phenomenal job at this. During almost every NFL game, the NFL ran ads encouraging people to get involved in the elections. Like those Ohio doctors, they even provided a QR code on the screen so that any viewer could scan that code to register to vote. Good for the NFL, putting its enormous footprint to work for democracy.

There is _no reason_ why every major company or workplace or institution is NOT doing this. Indeed, if they believe in democracy, they _should_ be doing this. I offer many examples to model in Chapter 11.

Again, these are all parts of your footprint. Use them to lift democracy.

**Scale Up: Collective Footprints**

Every one of the examples above starts with decisions by individuals to use their footprints to engage Americans who have been removed from the political conversation.

Do you see what a difference a shift in mindset and a little work and creativity can make? Friends and family; where you live; where you work; places you frequent—so many parts of your footprint can be used to engage or re-engage Americans. I hope these examples inspire you to brainstorm all the ways you can use _your_ footprint to do the same. Use the diagram at the end of this chapter to do so.

But that’s just the starting point. Now let’s take it a big step further. Let’s scale it up.

Everything I wrote above applies to organizations as well.

Businesses. Nonprofits. City Halls. Schools. Universities. Churches. So many more.

If one of the more dry bureaucracies in American government—the Bureau of Motor Vehicles—can lift so many into democracy, think of all the ways other institutions can re-engage Americans who have been systematically removed from the political conversation. And many, I believe, have a **civic duty** to lift their constituents—constituents many of them receive public funds to serve.

Just a few examples:

1. Local Government

_City governments_ across the nation should be utilizing every element of their public-facing footprints to re-engage constituents and get them back into the political process. Using their recreation centers, health clinics, senior centers, youth centers, fire stations, libraries, park buildings, or any other service they provide, all cities can and _should_ play this role. And because of the nature of their footprints—both physical and the services they provide—cities are ideally situated to participate in _every_ element of the cycle of engagement described above.

![[f116-1.jpg]]

And I’m not just talking about leaving voter registration papers in a corner of a desk somewhere. I’m talking about staff trained to bring up the issue of voting as people interact with them, then helping them sign on. Example:

_“Sir, thanks for checking in. We see that this is the first time you’ve come to this center. Are you registered to vote? Are you new to the community? If you moved, you’ll need to re-register. We can show you how to register right over here.”_

Or:

_“Do you have a state driver’s license? You don’t? Well, you need a state ID to vote. We can help you apply to get one.”_

That simple conversation needs to happen again and again. It largely doesn’t. For no good reason.

_Counties_ provide other critical services to communities across this country. These include a wide variety of social services helping families and folks in need; criminal justice services; court services; probation offices; public defender work; and so on. These all involve massive interfaces with the public—often the very people who are no longer part of the political world. _All_ of these could be put to work engaging constituents. All of them _should_ be.

In 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order that offers a great model for what every local government could also do. First, the order requires “each agency to submit. . . a strategic plan outlining the ways that the agency can promote nonpartisan voter registration and voter participation.”[^16] Every city and county could ask the same of its departments and agencies. As part of the effort, the Administration then outlined examples of voter engagement work various agencies had already begun: the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and others are all using their vast footprints in creative and effective ways, engaging veterans, newly naturalized Americans, public transit riders, job-seekers, and others. Take a look at the details to get ideas on how governments and agencies in your community could do the same.[^17]

Beyond the locations where they directly serve people, another large part of city and county footprints are the **countless organizations they _fund_** to serve constituents. Again, many of these organizations—nonprofits, public housing organizations, public transportation, daycare centers, health organizations—serve daily, and in huge numbers, the very people who are being disenfranchised. Counties and cities should encourage—or better yet, mandate—that these organizations use _their_ footprints to reengage Americans left out of the political conversation.

Finally, cities, counties and other local governments are constantly **communicating** with residents on a wide variety of matters, another substantial part of their footprints. Those communications can readily be put to work for democracy. In Atlanta, for example, the mayor mandated that communications from water bills to the city’s 311 information hotline provide information on registering to vote.[^18]

Is your city doing this work right now? Your county? Are they fighting back?

Ask them.

If the answer is no, then be sure they start. And have them formalize it through city or county policy staff training, updating intake processes, tracking data on progress, and more.

Then celebrate the hell out of it.

Think about it—mayors often engage in friendly competition about their sports teams. How about a competition among cities over who can register the most voters? And who has the highest overall turnout?

2. Universities, Law Schools, and Other Higher Ed Institutions

There’s no better way to get folks in the habit of voting than when they’re young. And no organization’s core mission dovetails more closely with building a vibrant democracy than institutions of higher education. Young folks also turn out to be in the cross-hairs of those attacking democracy.

So everywhere in this country, when students register for classes, they should be given the opportunity to register to vote. Every damn time! Everywhere. Information on how to register should also be part of orientation packets for new students. Along with how to get whatever ID is required. That’s just the beginning of what all colleges, universities, community colleges, and the like could do to lift democracy. Amid these institutions’ enormous footprints, the opportunities are boundless.

And it shouldn’t only be left to student activists and groups to make this happen. They’re there for four years, or less. A lot is happening in these students’ lives in that time. Turnover in student groups is rapid; leaders usually are in charge for just one of those four years. The **school itself** should use its footprint to build a pro-democracy infrastructure separate from whatever their students also build. Professors and administrators who are there for the long haul should ensure that it is in place—always.

But that’s just for the students.

Now let’s talk about the surrounding communities:

I love teaching Election Law at the University of Cincinnati Law School. And while my students have always seemed to enjoy the class, there’s always been one activity and class I know my class takes a back-seat to. Way, way back.

If a student in my class also takes part in the Innocence Project Clinic at UC, I know where I stand. This is a project that has led to the release of dozens of Ohioans who have been convicted of a crime only to be found innocent later by DNA evidence. Law students do much of the research and leg work that has led to this incredible success. And because they can make such a difference, they are passionate about it. It’s not just a class—it’s part of who they _are_ at the law school. Yes, part of their footprint.

Here’s a simple suggestion for every law school: **_create a pro-democracy and voter advocacy clinic that also taps into students’ passion to make a difference._** Use that clinic for every step of the engagement process. No one is better positioned to help voters navigate the hurdles of rejoining the political community than law students, especially when those barriers include legal hurdles: getting that photo ID, or returning to the community after serving time. No one is better positioned to build the type of partnerships (with court systems and other community organizations) to scale up a large effort in city after city.

These are just the most glaring examples. But there are so many more. Nonprofits, hospitals, labor unions, faith organizations, high schools, fraternal organizations and sororities, and businesses of all sizes. All need to get in the game of using their full footprints to help save democracy.

3. Traditional Political Groups and Voter Registration Organizations

There are some phenomenal voter registration organizations out there. Plugging away, every day, one voter at time. When they have the capacity and funding to do so, these groups are doing vital voter registration and engagement work as much as they can.

The more of this work, and the more funding for it, the better.

Here in Ohio, for example, nothing could be more important than a dedicated voter engagement effort hitting the doors and buildings and streets and “hot spots” of Cleveland, Youngstown, Toledo, Dayton, and other major cities that have seen a drop in urban registration and turnout. And the best approaches to these efforts are those that hire folks from within the community, to engage _others_ in the community in all the ways described above. This work must happen on an ongoing basis.

_BUT. . . all these efforts should do their work along the lines of the footprint model, harnessing the power of every footprint possible._ They should tap into individual social networks like Ebony DeLoach did. They should build relationships across communities in the way Vashitta did, enlisting organizations to use _their_ footprints to engage their constituents, clients, customers, residents, and others. That’s the only way to achieve the scale it’s going to take.

In the same way, _politically-minded activist groups, county and local parties_, and other political organizations should build their engagement efforts with the footprint model as the basis of their work. Specifically, they need to understand that _the most valuable thing_ a group of ten or thirty or fifty members brings to the table _are the ten or thirty or fifty entire footprints_ from which to build a robust community-wide and ongoing engagement effort. And that means rather than simply asking every member, precinct leader, or neighborhood captain to volunteer some time to do this work, they must ask them to take stock in and then use their _entire_ footprint to engage voters. They should train them on how to do so effectively, then facilitate and track them doing so.

You have a footprint in this world that touches so many people, in authentic and unique ways. Take a moment and think through all the ways you can harness that footprint for democracy.

Democracy Everywhere. Accountability Everywhere.  
_Run_ Everywhere!**

A body of men holding themselves accountable to nobody ought not to be trusted by anybody.

—Thomas Paine

“Canceled.”

That’s how the website Ballotpedia phrases it.

The “general election. . . was canceled.”[^19]

Not just any election, but the 2022 general election of Texas State Senator Bryan Hughes. Hughes has an instinct for the controversial, championing bills banning critical race theory, suppressing votes, and regulating social media after Twitter banned Trump following January 6. Nationally, however, Hughes created the biggest stir by authoring Texas’s abortion ban—which infamously includes a private bounty encouraging everyday Texans to sue doctors for performing procedures that were legal at the time.

People from beyond Texas (and other red states) might be surprised to learn that the Hughes abortion law is deeply unpopular in Texas. Only 11 percent of Texans support an abortion ban with no exceptions, such as his.[^20] So you’d think pushing such toxic legislation would risk raising the wrath of the voters and getting Hughes booted from office.

But Hughes actually faced zero risk. After all, his election was “canceled.” Why? Because no one ran against him in 2022. Bryan Hughes ran unopposed.

So when extreme bills come up again in 2023, what do we think Senator Hughes will do? The answer’s pretty obvious. He will toe the same extremist line he always has—the same approach that rewards him with all the power of an “elected” position despite facing no election whatsoever.

I wish Hughes’s was an isolated case. But it’s not.

In Mississippi, the author of the abortion ban that led to _Dobbs_ itself also didn’t face a challenge in the 2019 election that followed that law’s passage.

And the author of the Ohio six-week ban, no exceptions, also faced no opponent in 2022. Keep in mind, less than 10 precent of Ohioans support a ban with no exceptions. That was also the law that sparked national outrage when a 10-year-old rape victim had to travel to Indiana to get an abortion she couldn’t get in Ohio. Still, no opponent.

So, even as toxic abortion bans turned American politics upside down in 2022, the state-level _authors_ of those bans returned to their offices without even opposition. Not a single mailer, or phone call, or knock on a door, explained to constituents back in their districts what they had done. To return to Jack Pepper’s soccer game, these people are shooting at the goal, and no one even _tries_ to stop them. So what are they going to do? Keep shooting, of course. Scoring, too.

But even these three were far from alone.

In Ohio’s 2022 statehouse election, seventeen incumbents with similar toxic voting records faced no opponents. How toxic? All had voted for a bill requiring on-demand genital inspections of girl and teen athletes—that’s how toxic. Yet seventeen out of ninety-nine ran unopposed! In 2020, that number was twenty.

![[f131-1.jpg]]

In Texas, thirty-six out of the 86 “winning” GOP statehouse candidates faced no general election opponent. In Tennessee, thirty-seven of the 75 winning GOP candidates “won” without opposition. Florida, thirty-four out of 85. Add it all up, and even with all that was at stake in these states in 2022, millions of Americans had no choice when it came to who represented them in their statehouse. For those millions, democracy at the legislative level was indeed canceled.

![[f132-1.jpg]]

But it gets _even worse_ than that: these numbers only represent the seats where there was _no opponent_ at all. When you add the even greater number of seats where challengers were _so underfunded_ that they couldn’t undertake rudimentary tasks of a campaign, the numbers are far worse. In Ohio, for example, beyond the twenty unopposed incumbents in 2020, there were an additional thirteen challengers who didn’t raise or spend $5,000 in their entire campaign.

It turns out, Bryan Hugheses are everywhere!

But in a political world that focuses almost exclusively on federal outcomes and largely ignores state-level outcomes, that reality hardly raises a concern. It’s accepted as business as usual.

And that turns out to be a terrible mistake.

**Deep Damage to Democracy**

Once you realize that we’re in a battle for democracy itself—and that the front lines of that battle are the very statehouse seats where politicians like Bryan Hughes are spending entire careers advancing extremism unchallenged—you realize that these numbers aren’t just bad. They amount to _a crisis_, inflicting enormous damage.

Why so bad?

At the heart of a functioning, representative democracy is that voters make _the_ choice. And their collective choice is what legitimizes the government that represents them, and grants it the awesome power to impose laws we all must follow.

That choice also lays at the heart of the role played by the _individuals_ who _serve_ in representative government—people like Bryan Hughes. It legitimizes their exercise of power on behalf of and impacting those he represents, along with the people of the entire state.

But that choice also provides another crucial function when it comes to Bryan Hughes. It constitutes the single most important _moment of accountability_ Hughes and his colleagues encounter as they exercise vast power over their fellow citizens. If the people don’t like what Bryan Hughes is doing, they can choose someone else. And in a healthy representative democracy, the knowledge—and _fear_—that that may happen is the ultimate check on how Bryan Hughes wields that power. That ultimate accountability is supposed to shape the decisions Bryan Hughes makes, and beyond that, his entire mindset about the role he plays. It’s the one direct link back to the citizenry—the connection that puts the people in charge of their government, and renders them a check on _his_ actions. It’s the link that makes Bryan Hughes and his colleagues _public_ servants in the first place.

All that changes dramatically when the Bryan Hugheses of the world never face that moment of accountability. When that link disappears. Without it—without even a _fear_ of that accountability—that one and only check disappears. Representation essentially ends, and, left unchecked, his exercise of power falls away from being _public_ service. Goals are being served, of course, just not _for_ the broader public. The incentives and priorities go elsewhere. (See Chapter 7 for more).

And when dozens of Bryan Hugheses in individual states face no accountability—when so many don’t even fathom facing accountability for their exercise of power—the entire system breaks down.

Unfortunately, as the state-by-state numbers above make clear, that breakdown is happening rapidly. Hundreds like Bryan Hughes, facing no accountability, impose law after law that do the opposite of what their constituents want, fueling a downward spiral into extremism and corrosion of public service. And once these officials grow accustomed to power with no accountability from the people, a dangerous incentive arises to eliminate accountability going forward. No coincidence, Bryan Hughes and his abortion-banning counterparts also champion voter suppression measures with the same vigor as they do abortion bans.

But lack of accountability and the resulting extremism and corruption of public service are not the only consequences of allowing countless seats to go unchallenged, year after year. And while gerrymandering is obviously a major driver of the problem, not challenging incumbents in gerrymandered districts makes the damage far worse. Here’s how:

First, when hundreds of Bryan Hugheses go unchallenged, entire swaths of states _never hear a message from the pro-democracy side_ of the political battle—at least from anyone locally who voters may know and trust. Like Fox News playing on every television set in town, only one side is even in the conversation. Never hearing a counter-message from folks they know, huge numbers of voters become further removed from the broader and more balanced political conversation happening elsewhere. Just as Bryan Hughes gets more extreme, so do many of his constituents.

Second, _turnout suffers_. Studies show that funded, local candidates knocking on doors and communicating locally have an appreciable impact on turnout for _all_ candidates. Can you imagine how helpful it would’ve been to Beto Rourke, or Tim Ryan, or Val Demings, if there weren’t so many uncontested districts in Texas, Ohio, or Florida in the years they were running? If they didn’t have to do all that turnout work themselves? That eroded engagement impacts outcomes and erodes democracy.

Third, if you leave Bryan Hughes unchallenged, he doesn’t have to spend a dime defending himself back home. Instead, _his and other unchallenged incumbents’ resources get funneled into attacking the handful of Democratic candidates running in swing districts_. Politics is a team sport, and when districts go unchallenged, other members of the team directly pay the price. The pro-democracy side suffers as a whole.

What state was the exception to the numbers above—not allowing any Bryan Hugheses to run unchallenged in 2022? Michigan—Democrats there contested every seat. Who had a banner year in 2022? Michigan Democrats—they flipped both chambers and won every statewide office decisively. In 2018, when the Ohio Democratic House Caucus ran a candidate in all ninety-nine Ohio districts, we flipped six swing districts (after not having flipped a single one all decade). In both cases, every incumbent Republican was challenged, forced to defend his or her home turf. As a group, they had to spend their money more broadly. That’s not the only reason Ohio or Michigan Democrats gained seats in those years, but it made a difference.

Fourth, over time, if only one side is running in numerous districts, _broad swaths of that state become further and further disconnected from statehouse activity in general._ While other political offices may be hotly contested, voters don’t hear a word about their statehouse. This only heightens the lack of awareness and accountability for statehouse activity, accelerating the decline from a functioning democracy in the very place where most of our democracy is shaped. Or undermined.

Finally, but crucially, if you don’t run everywhere _within_ a state, _you are depriving yourself of victories you will never otherwise know about._ As those referenda in Kansas and Kentucky showed, the extremism in these and other states is far out of touch with their voters. The corruption in these places is gobsmacking. All this creates political opportunity, but you can only take advantage of that if you run everywhere.

In other words, you never know where your next Kansas victory might be if you don’t even _contest_ Kansas.

_Bottom line: our new normal must be to **field candidates in every state legislative district in every state in every election**, and to provide **enough support** so that these candidates can run a basic campaign and get a message out._

By doing so, you negate some of the damage above. Statehouse incumbents feel some level of accountability. All parts of a state hear the message from the pro-democracy side (and that side is now listening to every part of the state). Turnout and engagement rise. And awareness builds on what that statehouse is doing. And as we saw in Kansas, in some places, you can win outright.

And if you’re doing all this with a long game mindset, year after year, the benefits only compound as you go.

Run everywhere. Sounds like a straightforward goal, doesn’t it? There’s only one problem. . . .

**The Problem: An Infrastructure That Doesn’t Value Running Everywhere**

There _is_ a large and well-funded political infrastructure in this country which stands on the side of democracy—Team D, to repeat my moniker from above. Team D’s infrastructure achieves important, sometimes historic wins. But it has a fundamental flaw—it’s not an infrastructure that _values_ running _everywhere_.

It values running for federal seats in swing states and the few swing districts that exist in a world of gerrymandering. Accordingly, almost all of its resources and attention go to those swing, federal races. And in the process, Team D’s infrastructure leaves countless seats at the state level unchallenged, or so underfunded they might as well be unchallenged.

This means this is _not_ an infrastructure designed to bring accountability everywhere. _By design_, it leaves the Bryan Hugheses of this country free to advance extremism and attack democracy with no political recourse. It allows them to upend national politics with no consequence, term after term. To keep firing away at that goal, unobstructed.

As robust as it may be, it’s _not_ an infrastructure designed to protect democracy over the long term.

To run everywhere, and challenge extremism everywhere, and re-insert needed accountability everywhere, Team D’s infrastructure must change. _To protect democracy in a sustained way, we must build an infrastructure that **values** running everywhere._

At the highest levels, this requires that party officials and structures and organizations and major donors all must do things differently. Political leaders from President Biden on down must value running everywhere. Together, they must build an infrastructure that reflects and executes this mindset, and invests accordingly.

But just as in Chapter 4, this won’t happen at the necessary scale until everyday Americans lead the way. Ultimately, the essential building blocks of an infrastructure that _values_ running everywhere are _individuals_. It starts with everyday Americans, everywhere, taking steps to bring democracy and accountability back to where they live. Not just by demanding it of the powers that be, but by _doing it_ directly.

The good news is that there are practical ways that every American _can_ play this role. And there are some wonderful role models who are already doing so.

Let’s meet a few.

1. Start Where You Are.

Meg Overman is a busy woman. In her mid-thirties and a textbook editor, Meg and her husband are raising her stepdaughter, eighteen, son, twelve, and daughter, three, in Centerville, Ohio, just south of Dayton. That’s busy.

Still, the day after the _Dobbs_ decision came down, Meg emailed her clients to inform them she wouldn’t be available to work on Fridays. She was so livid about the Court’s decision, she told me, “I wasn’t sure what to do, I just wanted to put energy into it.” So Fridays would be her day to fight back.

Meg had seen extreme bills emerging from the Ohio statehouse for years, so she decided to start there. But the recent unconstitutional GOP gerrymander had changed who would represent Centerville in the state legislature. “I looked up who the Republican was, saw his voting record,” and immediately decided to help his opponent in the upcoming election.

There was only one problem: her next discovery was that that incumbent _had no opponent_. Meg was so horrified, she told me, “I couldn’t sleep. I spent three days so angry that there wasn’t even a choice of representative. There was literally no other option.”

And that’s when Meg Overman decided to run for state representative _herself_. But because the primary had already passed, she’d have to do it as a write-in candidate. Still, she went through the formal process of filing as a write-in because she wanted votes cast to formally count.

Over the coming months, she teamed up with various activist groups and organizations (the party apparently wasn’t very helpful) to send thousands of postcards and knock on thousands more doors to convince as many people as possible to write in her name for state representative.

In the end, 4,236 voters cast ballots with Meg’s name written on them. As with most write-in candidacies, that wasn’t enough to win. But still, Meg is glad she did it: “It was just about giving people a moment where they didn’t feel completely hopeless.”

We all should be glad she did it. She gave people a choice, and in doing so, she was a true champion of democracy.

Meg’s decision to step up represents the mindset that everyone who values democracy must adopt: democracy doesn’t start in some faraway swing state—_it starts where you live_, and bringing choice and accountability where you live. So if you find yourself in a statehouse district where an anti-democracy incumbent might go unchallenged, do what Meg did—make it your personal mission to change that.

If you have the wherewithal to run like Meg did, do it. No matter how long the odds, they aren’t as long as she faced, running as a write-in so late in the game.

And if you can’t run, think about _someone you know_ who can. Ask others you know to think about who _they_ know who might run. However you do it, like Meg did, take ownership to give the people of your community a choice, and a reason to vote. Don’t let an anti-democracy incumbent where you live become _your_ Bryan Hughes. Don’t let the voters of your district go through an election cycle where nobody tells them what that incumbent is doing—or what that statehouse is doing. And especially if you’re in a tough district, whatever you do, don’t wait for faraway powers-that-be to solve the problem. You, Meg, and women and men like you in hundreds of districts across the country, are more likely to fill that otherwise uncontested race than a national infrastructure that doesn’t value running everywhere.

So step one ends up being simple math: BH - MO = 0

Today, we have hundreds of Bryan Hugheses exercising power with no accountability. The way we change that is we _identify and enlist_, one person at a time, _an equivalent number of Meg Overmans to challenge them_.

So in the end, there are zero uncontested races left.

BH - MO = 0

2. Support Meg Overman and Those Like Her

So that’s our new normal: a candidate in every district. No more cancelled elections.

But make no mistake—Meg Overman, just stepping up and doing it on her own, is a rare breed. That’s why there are so many Bryan Hugheses.

We need to make it easier and more likely that folks run, especially in tough districts. And the most important step is to make it clear, through word and deed, that we _value_ folks stepping up and running everywhere.

That starts when we all follow Meg’s first instinct, before she ran herself. Don’t just contribute online to someone running for the US Senate in a far-away state. Help whoever is running in _your_ statehouse district.

When that candidate calls you for help, don’t find a way to get off the phone because she’s in a difficult district. _Thank her_ for stepping up. Thank her for doing something far tougher than running in a swing or safe district. Thank her for making a huge difference in your community’s and state’s democracy. From beginning to end—and after—thank her for performing as patriotic an act of public service as there is.

Then help her in any way you can—with your time (volunteering), with your resources, with your network (host a party), with your yard (agree to a sign). Whatever you can do, help. Use every part of your footprint that can help.

And if the Meg of your district never calls, seek _her_ out. Thank her. Help her. If we all do that, every cycle, more Meg Overmans will come forward. They will see that we value running everywhere. They will feel it. More will do it. Remember. . . long game.

To understand how important this is, imagine the opposite experience—which happens far too often. Someone steps up like Meg does, puts her life on hold, and _no one_ helps. Call after call, unreturned. No boost from the party; nor the legislative caucus; nor local organizations; few individuals beyond the candidate’s closest circle of friends and family. Stuck in an infrastructure that doesn’t value their run, these candidates feel that lack of value, painfully, every day of the race, including through deafening silence after they lose. Experiencing all that, most will never run again. If others ask them if _they_ should run, they will tell them (and I’ve heard this myself), “No way. It was awful. No one helped. No one cared. They’ve forgotten about us.” And _that_ is how we get so many Bryan Hugheses, year after year, all across America. As a long game, it’s a disaster.

Bottom line: _value_ running everywhere, starting with the candidate running in your own community. The harder the run, the bigger the thank you.

3. Scale Up from There

Run in every district. Support a candidate in every district.

Hundreds of funded Meg Overmans. No more uncontested races.

BH - MO = 0.

Those are the building blocks.

Now let’s scale up from there.

I know what you’re thinking: _Run in every district? Support every candidate running in those districts? C’mon! Where’s the money to do all that?_

A fair question, to which I offer two answers:

_First, did you see how much money Amy McGrath raised to take on Mitch McConnell!?_ Or Jaime Harrison raised to take on Lindsey Graham? Or Val Demings raised to take on Marco Rubio?

The answers: $88 million, $108 million, more than $70 million. Almost entirely from small-dollar, grassroots donors from around the country, willing—no, fired up!—to give in tough races.

Why?

Because those who care about democracy have been conditioned to _value_ these Senate races. They’ve been told that the way we prevail in our political battle is via these and other Senate candidacies. And the value placed on these Senate races is so deeply imbued and passionately felt that people around the nation shower their dollars into even uphill battles in (for most) faraway Kentucky, South Carolina, and Florida.

Let me be clear: I don’t fault these Senate candidates for raising all that money. They were doing their jobs, inspiring people to help them run robust races. Good for them! And remember, we need to run everywhere.

But when you realize that in those same campaign cycles, there were hundreds of Bryan Hugheses running unopposed for districts in states across this country, and countless other Meg Overmans with under $5,000 in their accounts, you should also be frustrated by the disconnect. I am. When it comes to which candidates we fund, the chasm between the few haves and the thousands of have-nots keeps us from protecting democracy.

But don’t just be frustrated.

There’s also good news—because what Amy McGrath and the others make clear is that when we _do_ sufficiently value something in politics, robust resources and intense passion can follow. We just need to broaden _the conversation about what we value_ if we want to save democracy_—_and, specifically, show pro-democracy Americans and activists that _there is as great a value to running everywhere as there is to taking on Mitch McConnell_. And then we need to create mechanisms that allow them to act upon that value—making it as easy to help the Meg Overmans as it was to get online and give to Amy McGrath.

![[f147-1.jpg]]

Think of it as our pro-democracy budget. Take just 10 percent of what Amy McGrath raised, direct it to statehouse races across _entire_ states, and you could fund a Meg Overman running in _every_ district. Do it year after year (again, long game), and you forever change democracy.

_Which brings me to my second response: let me tell you a story about a little group called Blue Ohio:_

The direct message showed up in my Twitter account mid-November 2021, only weeks after I’d rolled out _Laboratories of Autocracy._ It came from Missouri, amid a flood of communications from across the country—sharing with me that my description about the decline of Ohio at the hands of a rigged legislature mirrors the same painful decline people are experiencing in so many other states.

But Michele Hornish’s email from Missouri was different. Yes, Missouri is going through the same anti-democracy, extremist hell that Ohio is. But Michele’s email didn’t dwell on that. Instead, in the great tradition of the “Show Me” state, she offered a solution. As she wrote, her organization “uses grassroots monthly donations to support Democrats in Missouri running for state legislature. We ensure that even those ‘lost cause’ races with R+20 have some funds to work with—and in doing so encourage more people to, as you call it, enter the arena and run.”

What Michelle’s organization was doing, in other words, was convincing a portion of those grassroots donors to _value_ running _everywhere_ in Missouri—and giving them an easy way to do so.

Seven months after Michele’s email, using her Missouri model as our template, we rolled out **Blue Ohio**. Our mission is simple: create a grassroots community of Ohioans who _value running everywhere_. By October of 2022—only five months after launching—this community already had grown to more than 1,100 members. We host monthly virtual lunch calls, featuring candidates, officeholders, and other guests—we were even joined by Ed O’Neill (“Al Bundy” from _Married with Children_), who’s from Youngstown.

![[f148-1.jpg]]

Again, our mantra is that we _value_ running everywhere across Ohio. So much so, that every one of our 1,100 members contributes monthly, at an average level of $14. And where do those funds go? One hundred percent go to candidates for Ohio’s legislature, using a formula that we call the “bathtub model”—we _start with the most difficult districts and work our way up from there_. That’s how we got to know Meg Overman, and many like her, who’d stepped up to run in very difficult circumstances and districts. In just its infancy, the Blue Ohio community became the single largest supporter of Meg and numerous other candidates. Our members’ funds helped pay for the postage and the postcards and the other materials Meg needed to get thousands of voters to write in her name.

In _only five months_ of existence, in fact, the 1,100 members of Blue Ohio accomplished something amazing. Recall how in 2020 there were thirteen Ohio candidates with less than $5,000 in their whole campaign? In 2022, t_hat number fell to zero_. Why? Because Blue Ohio _values_ running everywhere, and filled the gap for all those underfunded candidates.

![[f149-1.jpg]]

While that was a good start, _this is a long-game strategy_. The goal is to keep increasing the membership of Blue Ohio—from one thousand to two thousand to five thousand. And every month, all those individuals will keep giving to support statehouse candidates, building and building and building. On our current trajectory, _Blue Ohio may become one of the biggest supporters of legislative candidates in the state of Ohio by 2024_.

![[f150-1.jpg]]

Think about that: one of the largest supporters won’t be a company or group looking for private gain. Or political favors. Or payback. Just a community of citizens who are passionate about democracy, and accountability, and who understand that running for the legislature everywhere is a crucial step to advancing both.

And with Blue Ohio and its thousands of members showing that we _value_ folks running everywhere, our hope and goal will be that _more_ will run—that, ultimately, there will be no Bryan Hugheses in Ohio. And far more Meg Overmans—nineteen more, to be exact, because that’s how many Ohio districts were uncontested in 2022. And not only do we want a candidate running in every district, we want them to each have a baseline of support so they can run a solid campaign. Our goal is to keep growing in numbers such that we are always raising the water level in that bathtub, lifting candidates everywhere. Holding extremists accountable everywhere.

What we need in regions and states across this country are individuals coming together to _value_ running everywhere, starting in the communities where you live. And you may not raise the money that Amy McGrath did. But like Blue Ohio, over time, you will raise enough to make a difference, lifting candidates across the entire state where you live.

So, beginning today, take stock in your footprint and do whatever you can to start building that community. And if you want help, go to www.blueohio.org]], learn more, and reach out.

4. Now Scale Even Higher

Run everywhere. Support candidates everywhere, starting with where you live. Every year.

The essential building blocks of a fifty-state, all-district democracy.

But that’s just the baseline—the blocking and tackling of democracy. Now let’s scale it up one more time. Let’s truly go on offense _for_ democracy in states by getting _everyone_ involved, beyond where they live.

Many who care about democracy are fortunate to be directly represented by folks who _are_ fighting for democracy, in states that are healthy democracies. So after those of you in this sanguine situation ensure that that remains the case, we also need you elsewhere. Because your footprint can make a _huge_ difference elsewhere. And because—just as gerrymandered statehouses helped put election deniers in charge of the US House—threats to democracy in some states ultimately spill over to the nation, including where you live.

How can folks help elsewhere?

You’ve already met Rhoda. Jack. Vashitta. Ebony. Kim. Meg. And Michele.

Now let me introduce you to Gerry.

Unlike the others, this isn’t her real name. But that’s how the country best knows her—“Gerry,” from the hit show _Succession_, general counsel for the Waystar Royco media empire with some surprisingly spicy personal traits.

The real-life woman who plays Gerry is Emmy-nominated actress J. Smith Cameron. Like Meg Overman, J. is very busy. When a season of _Succession_ is being filmed, her schedule is erratic—some days are free, others can start at four a.m. and not end until the early evening.

But like Meg, J. is passionate about democracy. So in 2022, she chose to dedicate a significant part of her sizeable footprint to lifting democracy. Viewers would’ve been tipped off to J.’s activism when she brandished a “Bans Off Our Bodies” purse on the red carpet at the Emmy’s. That symbolism was fitting, because behind the scenes, J. is working to _ensure_ fewer bans on women’s bodies.

J. gathered creative colleagues who largely live in places represented by champions of democracy, and they collectively decided to protect democracy elsewhere. Which is when and how I had the privilege of meeting her.

On a Zoom call, I joined J., along with other _Succession_ stars, a variety of singers and actors—even “Buffalo Bill” from _Silence of the Lambs_—and other friends and family members in J.’s wide network. I watched as they deliberated _where_ they would lend their collective footprints to lift democracy. They looked at Michigan, where Democrats only needed to flip two seats to take control of that state’s House and Senate. North Carolina, where Democrats needed to win enough seats to protect the governor’s veto. Arizona, also only several seats from a majority.

Then they considered Pennsylvania. This would be a bold choice, because Pennsylvania Democrats entered the 2022 election needing to win twelve seats—a big lift for one election. But some in the group liked that Pennsylvania was close enough geographically that they could volunteer, on the ground, to help make a difference there. So J. and her group went for it, and voted to “adopt” Pennsylvania.

Over the next six months, amid all the other things on their full plates, Team J. dedicated time, money, and their networks to support statehouse candidates throughout Pennsylvania. They met and lifted candidates just like Meg Overman. This support allowed these candidates to hire staff while running robust digital, mail, earned media, and television campaigns. The financial lift also freed these candidates up to knock on doors and meet their voters—the single most important thing these candidates can do to win their races—as opposed to sitting in an office making fundraising calls all day.

(_Reality check_: one reason “freeing them up” from those calls is so important is because within an infrastructure that doesn’t value running everywhere, the candidates J. supported occupy the bottom of the priority list. In dialing for dollars even in their own state, these candidates would fall far below Josh Shapiro, who was running for governor, and John Fetterman, running for senator, and every other statewide official running, and every member of Congress. In short, for these legislative candidates to even get their endless calls _returned_ would be a rare event. But in 2022, Emmy-nominated J. Smith Cameron, all her friends on _Succession_, and a whole lot of others made _these candidates_ their top priority. In turn, the candidates could use far more of their precious time talking directly to voters at their doors and in their communities.)

But J. and her friends weren’t the only ones who did this heroic work. Across the country, everyday Americans—nurses, teachers, parents, and others—also gathered their networks to donate dollars and time to support legislative candidates in other states.

![[f155-1.jpg]]

In 2022, I joined numerous Zoom meetings just like the one J. pulled together. I watched hundreds of democracy champions help candidates in usually overlooked legislative races. I observed as folks in California and Washington State fought for democracy in Arizona and Pennsylvania. I watched as people who lived in states like Maine and Minnesota rallied to elect state representatives who would protect their rights and freedoms. And I joined groups of activists in New York and New Jersey going to bat for candidates in Michigan, Nebraska, and North Carolina. Call after call, they pushed and prodded and raised resources to help overlooked candidates in states near and far.

And then I watched election night, 2022, as history was made.

In Michigan, where thirty-nine groups just like J.’s had come together to support candidates, both the state House and Senate flipped for the first time since the horrific gerrymander of 2010.

In Minnesota, where seventeen groups pitched in, the Senate flipped, and the House majority held.

In North Carolina, where twenty-eight groups rallied to help, Democrats succeeded in protecting the governor’s veto.

Similar groups also helped those fighting for democracy in Nevada, Maine, and New Hampshire achieve strategic goals.

And back in J.’s adopted Pennsylvania, Democrats flipped the exact number of seats they needed to—twelve—to take back control of their statehouse. The decisive, “tipping point” twelfth seat in Pennsylvania was won by sixty-three votes! Stunning.

In all, 2022 was the first year since 1934 that the party in power in the White House did not lose a single state legislative chamber in a midterm election. Even better, the gains in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and the other states actually reversed that historic trend.

Of course, many factors played a role in that success. And everything starts with the candidates themselves and their teams on the ground. But the fact that J. and so many others rallied to “adopt” and help candidates in the very states and districts that saw the most dramatic, counter-cyclical results (and many of those gains were achieved with razor-thin margins) is not a coincidence.

This didn’t occur by happenstance. This was all organized. A group called **The States Project** made it easy for all of them. They encouraged people to organize “Giving Circles” like J.’s around the country. They provided the analysis that informed decisions about which states to select. Then they facilitated the process of Giving Circles growing, adopting states, raising support, and distributing that support back to candidates in their adopted states.

How did they succeed? It’s a simple, practical formula.

Step one involves convincing participants to _value_ these statehouse races in the first place. As the States Project’s leader Melissa Walker explained to me—“Our job is to convince people leading Giving Circles that these state legislative races matter.” They show how statehouses comprise an “absolute pivot point on power. State legislative majorities are a huge lever for all the kitchen table issues we care about—healthcare, civil rights, environmental policy, education funding, reproductive rights—and a huge lever for federal power because they control voting rights and they draw the congressional district lines that decide who goes to Washington DC.”

They also convince them that their effort _matters._ J. explained to me that a key to recruiting participants was showing them that “this is where your donation dollar goes the furthest. It’s something where you can actually make a difference, and it’s doable.” Melissa echoed her: “It’s cheaper to change the balance of power of an entire state chamber than winning a single competitive Congressional seat.”

Finally, The States Project has created a mechanism that makes it easy to do all this—the Giving Circle model. And at the heart of _that_ success are the individuals themselves—and the ties binding them. Melissa explained: “You’re doing it with your friends and your families and your neighbors. You’re learning together. It’s peer-to-peer. So when one member says it matters, they listen.” It’s a perfect example of groups of people dedicating important parts of their footprints to _value and support_ races that play a direct role in shaping America’s democracy. And when you add up the net impact of all those footprints, it moves the needle.

![[f158-1.jpg]]

Think back to the dollars Amy McGrath raised, and the need to broaden the conversation about how we best save democracy. Just like Blue Ohio, J. and her fellow democracy champions spearheaded that exact conversation. And they took a portion of that pro-democracy budget and invested it at the statehouse level, where it’s so desperately needed. The States Project masterfully made it easy and effective for them to do so.

So consider what J. did, the overall success of groups like hers, and look at your own footprint.

Can you put together a group of ten or twenty or more people who care about democracy? Who can commit some fraction of your collective footprint to lifting democracy where you live? And if where you live feels like it’s in good hands, are you willing to lift democracy elsewhere?

Can you help ensure that five or ten or fifteen percent of the funds that go to those US Senate races are invested to protect the front lines of democracy?

If the answer is yes, get started. Create your own Giving Circle. Adopt a state and start lifting.

Can’t start one yourself? You probably know a friend who can. Or perhaps you’re in a group that can. Work with them to get it going.

**Scaling Up the _Value Running Everywhere_ Infrastructure**

Meg Overman had one piece of vital feedback for me about her last-minute run: “There’s no information out there about what to do if you want to run. That needs to be fixed.”

And she’s right. There are all sorts of barriers to running, starting with basic information of how you do it without screwing up. And this barrier is even higher for folks who aren’t political insiders, who are often the very people who _should_ run for office.

The good news is that there’s an entity working to fix this. It’s called **Run for Something**, and the team there is **recruiting people** like Meg to run for office all over the country. But they need help to scale up their operation.

![[f160-1.jpg]]

Now, once we start running in every district, the next problem that arises is **staffing**. Smart, passionate staff can make all the difference in these campaigns. So how can all these candidates find high quality campaign staff to run the best campaigns possible? Well, there are groups working on that too. One is called **Arena**, and they train and embed staff in campaigns all over the country. They also need help.

Next, as candidates and their staff run in every district in the country, they face a huge learning curve when it comes to using **cutting-edge data and digital tools** to run the most effective campaigns possible. How can we maximize that opportunity, which also will save money? There’s a group for that too—it’s called **Tech for Campaigns**. They match highly skilled tech volunteers with state legislative candidates across the country, and in 2022, lifted a number of candidates to victory in—you guessed it—Michigan (twenty-eight candidates), Pennsylvania (thirteen), Minnesota (twenty-five), and other states.

(What did Jessica Alter and Gina Kim of Tech for Campaigns want me to emphasize about their 2022 success? The long game. “We’ve been in Pennsylvania for six years. Same with Michigan.” They summarize their 2022 wins as “a six-year-long overnight success.” They’re always building. Always learning.)

Now, what if you’re in a district that’s in solid pro-democracy hands, you want to help in a faraway state, but you don’t have a large group of your own to create a “Giving Circle” like J. did? Or you want to **volunteer time** more than raise funds. Well, there’s a group that can help with that too. It’s called **Sister District,** and they can directly link you into strategic districts across the country just like The States Project did.

Another new group called **The Union** connects people all over the country to strategic campaign **volunteer opportunities**. The **Mobilize** website connects visitors to a wide variety of activism opportunities taking place in the moment, or near future.

Now what if you want to help in a statehouse campaign in a state where democracy is under attack, but you don’t have an ability to actually travel to that state and help? And you don’t like making phone calls. Well, there are groups for that too—matching folks who want to pitch in with the races where they can be of most help, and encouraging them to write **personalized postcards** to the voters of that district. **Markers for Democracy** does this work non-stop, every year—many of its most prolific postcard writers are also part of active Giving Circles.

The point of all of this is that there is an infrastructure that is building, organically, from the ground up that _does value_ running everywhere. We need to scale that infrastructure up as quickly as possible. And the good news is that there are countless ways that millions of Americans can help make that happen. By participating. By supporting.

If you have the wherewithal and the interest, look any of them up. See if there’s a way you can join them. Or help them. Or maybe they can help you. Or both.

Bottom line:

Step 1: BH - MO = 0

Step 2: do it again.

Step 3: do it again.

Step 4: do it again.

Together, let’s build an infrastructure to get this done.

**Denying the Deniers: Protecting Election Integrity and Voters on the Front Lines**

[W]e have to be a lot sharper the next time when it comes to counting the vote. There’s a famous statement: ‘Sometimes the vote counter is more important than the candidate.’[^21]

—Donald Trump

We’re going to take this back village by village. . . precinct by precinct.[^22]

We’re taking over the elections.[^23]

—Steve Bannon

[W]e can be especially proud of the City of Milwaukee (80.2% Dem Vote) casting 37,000 less votes [in 2022] than cast in the 2018 election with the major reduction happening in the overwhelming Black and Hispanic areas.[^24]

—Robert Spindell, Wisconsin Election Commission (and 2020 fake elector)

Kari Lake was one scary candidate. J.D. Vance was infuriating. Herschel Walker, baffling.

But despite all the attention they received, they weren’t the scariest of the anti-democracy crop running in 2022.

With one exception, the scariest candidates didn’t get nearly as much attention. That exception was Doug Mastriano—the GOP governor candidate in Pennsylvania. He _did_ earn attention both for his extreme views and his role building up to January 6. But a prime reason he was such a dangerous candidate was that the governor of the Keystone State also appoints the secretary of state. And the prospect that a right-wing election denier might oversee Pennsylvania elections is as perilous as it gets for democracy.

But by late 2022, that same risk grew in states across the country. Sixty percent of Americans encountered an election denier on their ballot that November. And as in Pennsylvania, some of them were vying for offices that would put them in control of an entire state’s election process. In Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Michigan, Minnesota, and other states, full-out election deniers were running for secretary of state. And when I say election denier, I’m talking about candidates who not only amplified the “Big Lie” that Trump won the 2020 election, but promised to de-certify the results of the 2020 election as well as empower in-state officials to reject election results going forward.

So even with the US Senate and House in the balance, by the fall of 2022, those races posed the biggest threat to democracy. Even one or two breakthroughs by election-deniers risked upending democracy going forward. And entering a midterm election when Democrats were the party in control in Washington, history suggested that _at least_ one or two _would_ break through in toss-up states.

Thanks to a herculean effort, that worst case scenario didn’t transpire. In the most remarkable outcome of a night that surprised America, pro-democracy candidates ran the table in states where the presidency had been in the balance in 2020, or will be in the balance in 2024.

Still, in some states—Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin—the margins of victory were razor-thin. And of course, numerous election deniers won at other levels. So rather than celebrating, we should view this as the warning sign and growing threat that it is.

To protect democracy going forward, we need to build on and learn from the 2022 pro-democracy effort so that we never get that close again. And then we have to go even further, and dig far deeper. The coordinated 2022 effort to storm election offices with election deniers was just the first wave, and those secretary of state offices were only the _crest_ of that wave. Below the surface, too many election deniers are _succeeding_ in getting themselves elected and selected to positions that play pivotal roles in the trenches of American elections.

![[f170-1.jpg]]

Everyday Americans who value democracy can and must play a role in fighting back.

**The Challenge: Election Deniers on the Move in States**

So how did we reach a point where outright election deniers came so perilously close to overseeing American elections? The quotes that open this chapter make clear that _this is the plan_. In fact, those at the top of the election-denying world are hard at work placing like-minded extremists in important positions up and down the infrastructure that operates American elections.

At the highest level, organizers tied to efforts to overturn the 2020 election began building a slate of election-denying secretary of state candidates by the middle of 2021. They called themselves the America First Secretary of State Coalition, and Jim Marchant, the GOP candidate in Nevada, emerged as the coalition’s public leader. With high-profile endorsements (some by Trump himself) and financial support through an affiliated PAC, many of these America First candidates emerged victorious in GOP primaries. They campaigned together in the Fall.

But secretaries of state are just the most visible element of America’s election infrastructure. Elections in the United States are a highly decentralized operation, with countless functions and decisions impacting millions of voters occurring at the most local of levels. And following 2020, those under-the-radar posts also emerged as a hub of activity for “Big Lie” proponents.

Not long after January 6, Steve Bannon used his radio show to rally election deniers to sign up for party precinct positions all over the country. In addition to having a voice in party operations themselves, including party leadership and candidate endorsements, these local and county-level partisan positions play a variety of roles over election administration and oversight. Depending on the state, they help decide who is selected as a poll worker, election observer, and even a member of a county election board.

In some states, these new precinct officials built enough critical mass to oust GOP elections officials who’d refused to go along with the “Big Lie” efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Some who replaced them made clear they would not have certified those 2020 results. For example, the GOP election official who defied heavy pressure to certify the vote in Wayne County, Michigan, (Detroit) has already been replaced by an election denier.

At the same time, a loose network of right-wing groups has been recruiting election deniers to serve as election judges, inspectors, canvass board members, poll watchers, and poll workers, which in some states have the power to challenge voters at the polls or resolve disputes that arise. One Trump-affiliated group, the Conservative Partnership Institute, distributes a guide that encourages these recruits to attend as many election office and board meetings as possible, and gives tips on how to best identify and challenge voters on election day.

Released from a consent decree in 2018, the national Republican Party has gotten into the act, training and placing volunteers to challenge voters in largely Democratic areas. Even as they serve as formal poll workers on the inside of polling places, these workers are given “hotlines” to call party-identified lawyers to address voter issues that arise. In Michigan, during a training, the Wayne County GOP encouraged poll workers and observers to defy local election rules.[^25] And these practices only look to grow worse as election deniers run and win state GOP chair and other party leadership positions; in Michigan, for example, the election-denying secretary of state candidate who lost in November 2022 was elected party chair only months later.[^26] Similar takeovers occurred in Kansas and Idaho.[^27]

Together, these actions heighten the odds of election disputes and outright intimidation of voters and election staff on election day, or in the days that follow as final vote counts are tabulated. As one Wisconsin elections official wrote in an email that went public in January 2023, that impact is a not-so-hidden part of the overall plan. Turnout in urban Milwaukee declined, this official crowed, in part due to a “substantial & very effective Republican Coordinated Election Integrity program resulting with lots of Republican paid Election Judges & trained Observers & extremely significant continued Court Litigation.”[^28]

Most of this activity is a new development. Since they are playing a long game against democracy, it will inevitably grow, as they learn from their successes and failures for future election cycles.

So what do we do?

**Standing Up for Voters and Fair Elections**

How did pro-democracy candidates manage to defeat election deniers in almost every secretary of state race in the nation?

Go back to the last chapter. Recall the opportunity I described—that when we collectively decide to _value_ a race, momentum follows. As it did for Amy McGrath in Kentucky, generating millions of dollars. As it did for the States Project from Michigan to Pennsylvania. And as it did in April 2023, when a single race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court emerged as a national, pro-democracy priority.

That also happened, in the nick of time, for those secretary of state races.

In 2018, the candidates for secretary of state were generally low-profile affairs amid campaigns for the US House, Senate, and governor races that garnered far more attention. As one indicator of that support, candidates for secretary of state races in six battleground states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, and Wisconsin) had raised less than $12 million combined by November of 2018. And infrastructure to support these candidates was minimal.[^29]

Four years later, a wholly different story emerged. By November of 2022, candidates in those same states had raised more than $26 million. And who was raising the most? The pro-democracy candidates. As the extremism of the America First candidates became a storyline over the summer and fall, a surge of dollars flowed to those pro-democracy candidates around the country. Both Arizona and Nevada, for example, offered tight races with extremists running on the GOP ticket. But with the attention and late surge, the Democratic candidates—once behind in fundraising—outraised their opponents by three and four times, respectively, in the final months.[^30]

That direct candidate support was bolstered by a robust infrastructure that also went to bat for democracy. The Democratic Association of Secretaries of State (DASS) invested tens of millions in the battleground states, and an organization called iVote also invested millions. Together, these efforts eclipsed the outside spending on behalf of election deniers, as well as _all_ support in prior election cycles.

It’s a case study of what happens when we broadly decide to _value_ races that play a pivotal role in securing democracy. And what happens when we build a robust infrastructure to support those efforts.

The year 2022 must become Team D’s standard operating procedure. We must _always_ value these races going forward: know exactly who is running in these states and where there is a risk of losing, and pitch in however you can.

**Getting to the Front Lines**

So that’s the highest level of America’s election infrastructure operation. But what about the ground floor? We must build a counter-movement to what Steve Bannon and company are trying to construct, starting immediately.

Bottom line: We need people passionate about protecting democracy and voting rights serving in the very positions where Bannon is trying to recruit election deniers. By taking on these roles, those who value democracy can protect it one voter, one precinct, and one election at a time.

While they vary based on what state you live in, here are some of the formal posts that we must populate with pro-democracy patriots:

**1.**  **Poll workers**: poll workers are the essential worker bees of American democracy. Through a variety of election day tasks, they ensure that each precinct runs smoothly and securely and that voters are guided through the voting process. Roles include poll judges or managers, who oversee a polling place, and clerks or workers, who staff a polling place. Poll workers are selected through a variety of processes, depending on the state; in some states, it’s a nonpartisan process, but in others, they emerge from a partisan process.

**2.**  **Canvassing boards**: in many states, bodies called canvassing boards canvass and certify the election results. Members are usually chosen by the political parties.

**3.**  **Election boards**: in many states, elections boards are charged with overseeing and operating elections, guided by state law and regulations. Again, board members are usually determined by party officials and selection processes. In Ohio, there are two members from each party on each county’s board—selected by the respective county parties. In North Carolina, the posts are filled from the top—the two state parties appoint members to a state elections board, which then appoints four members (two of each party) to each county’s board of elections from a list of recommended names submitted by the state parties. The governor appoints the chair of each county board.

**4.**  **Local or county election administrators, supervisors, and clerks**: in some states, these positions are determined by election (either partisan or nonpartisan); in others, they are appointed by election boards or directly by political parties. When these posts are determined by elections, they can be low-profile affairs where a few hundred votes determine the winner. In 2021, in Pennsylvania, for example, many of these seats went unopposed, allowing election-deniers to win just by running, or as write-in candidates. _Nowhere_ should the operations of our elections be overseen by one side accumulating participation trophies while the other side looks on.

**5.**  **Vote-by-mail processing work**: in some states, political parties play a direct role in accepting or rejecting mail-in ballots. In Texas, for example, county-level Early Voting Ballot Board and Signature Verification Committees are appointed by the respective parties.

**6.**  **Ballot adjudicators**: a variety of processes and positions are used to adjudicate ballots that are in dispute due to mistakes, overvotes, misspellings, and other issues. In Georgia, for example, Vote Review Panels (comprised of representatives of the political parties and the election supervisor) adjudicate certain ballots to determine whether and how votes in question should be counted.

Of these formal election roles across the country, approximately 60 percent are partisan (political parties fill the roles); the rest nonpartisan. In most states, it’s a combination of the two.

We need champions of democracy to sign up for these roles for the long haul. We need trained and experienced advocates performing these functions every year, confident enough to stand _for_ fair elections and stand up _to_ whatever nonsense—planned or non-planned—may be thrown their way. They also need to be centered on the interests of the _voter—_willing to stand up _on behalf of voters_ against an election bureaucracy that sometimes favors cost-cutting or efficiency at the expense of voters. (Some of my most frustrating moments as a party chair in Ohio were when Democratic elections officials publicly signed onto GOP plans to, for example, get rid of in-person voting the Monday before election day. They said it made things more convenient—maybe for the bureaucracy, but not for the voter!)

If we don’t step up and serve, an election-denier will—or, just as concerning, the job won’t get done, which may lead to poll closures or disruptions to counting votes and certifying elections.

So if you are passionate for democracy and interested in serving in any of these roles, check with your local political party and/or election board to see how various roles are filled where you live. (See the resources listed below.)

Beyond these posts, there are numerous _volunteer roles in voter protection_ that also require democracy champions to serve. This voter protection work aims to ensure that every voter can vote, that every eligible vote is counted, and that election results are certified according to law. That’s as important as public service gets.

Here are some roles you can play to help make sure it happens:

**1.**  **Hotline volunteers**: state and national Democratic parties operate voter hotlines to answer voter questions and troubleshoot issues that arise on election day or during early voting. The more volunteers there are to staff these hotlines, the smoother elections go.

**2.**  **Ballot observers and monitors**: in many states, state and county parties appoint volunteers to monitor the opening, scanning, processing, and/or counting of ballots, as well as election recounts. These volunteers ensure that vote counting is done according to law and focus on issues such as chain of custody of ballots or, more relevant now than ever, potential disruptions to processing by other partisan observers.

**3.**  **Poll watchers**: these are observers appointed by state or county parties (or sometimes candidates) to monitor in-person voting at polling places—either during early voting or on Election Day.

**4.**  **Ballot cure volunteers**: particularly in high-volume elections, there are often thousands of voters whose vote-by-mail ballot has been rejected because of a technical defect (such as a mismatched signature or failure to provide ID) who are thus required to take steps to “cure” that ballot for it to be counted. Likewise, certain voters who have cast a “provisional” ballot may be required to provide ID or proof of residency to have their vote counted. Ballot cure volunteers contact these voters and assist them in resolving the problem so that their vote will count.

**5.**  **County or local election board liaisons**: long before election day or early vote periods, local boards of elections make critical decisions about a variety of issues. Volunteers can play an important role in monitoring those conversations and decisions by attending local election board meetings, monitoring election administration decisions, and building relationships with local election officials. This work can result in both advocacy and troubleshooting efforts before and during the election itself.

Again, many of these roles are overseen by political parties; with some, nonpartisan groups also get involved. Either way, as Republicans mobilize an army of election deniers to serve as poll watchers (and potentially intimidate voters or disrupt elections), it’s critical that pro-democracy champions stand in the gap for voters and fight back.

Check with your local party on how to get involved in these ways. And when you do serve in one of these volunteer or election administration roles, keep a few things in mind.

**1.**  **Wherever you serve, you’re making a difference.** Anything you can do—even if it’s just taking off work on election day to serve as a poll watcher—is important and helps to advance democracy.

**2.**  **Bring an equity lens to your work and seek out the places of greatest need**—even if that means sacrificing a little more of your time and comfort. Voter suppression and intimidation tactics are designed to have a disproportionate impact on marginalized and vulnerable voters, including voters of color and voters with disabilities. Seek out opportunities to empower voters in these communities. For example, if you choose to serve as a poll worker or poll watcher, consider that the place of greatest need may not be the polling place closest to you but one in an underserved community a little further away. These communities may be more likely to experience poll worker shortages, long lines, poll closures, and voter suppression tactics. By driving a little further, and committing more of your time, you can amplify your impact.

**3.**  **Don’t wait for the November general election** in an even-numbered year to get involved. Primary elections and special or municipal elections can be great opportunities to learn the ropes and get comfortable in these important roles. And protecting the vote can have a significant impact on the outcome of critical local elections, which are often decided by slim margins.

**4.**  **A boring day is a great day for democracy.** Some people get into voter protection work wanting to see some “action”—and they’re disappointed when everything is quiet and going smoothly. The truth is, it’s worth celebrating when the lines to vote are short and voters can cast a ballot without fear of intimidation. So wherever you plug in, go in hoping for a boring day—and know that just by being there and doing the job, you’re playing an important role and helping to safeguard democracy. And your presence may have played a role in _making_ it boring.

**Scaling Up: Year-Round Voter-Protection Infrastructure**

One of the first pieces of news I received when I became chair of the Ohio Democratic Party was that the national party would no longer fund our voter protection director. (That was early 2015—so the 2016 presidential election was already under way.) Later in the cycle, we would of course bring on a new director. But in the meantime, so much of the work to build up the voter protection infrastructure described above was simply not happening.

This on-again, off-again pattern still happens today in most places. Because—yes, to return to a familiar theme—we treat voter protection work as part of the sporadic federal election cycle as opposed to the broader and ongoing battle for democracy. Which means we lose precious time and scale, all while Steve Bannon and others aren’t taking a single day off from _their_ recruiting and training.

We can no longer take those days and months off either. To mobilize a volunteer-powered, voter protection movement at the needed scale, there must be an infrastructure in place that supports it. And that means replacing boom-and-bust voter protection work with a year-round and sustained infrastructure to do the work 24/7/365.

For an example as to how to do this, let me introduce you to Kim Allen:

January 6 was a disturbing day for almost all Americans. We’ll always remember where we were, won’t we?

But it was especially jarring for Kim Allen and so many of her colleagues in Georgia. Because more than perhaps in any other state, January 6, 2021, started in celebration. Only hours before, Georgia had stunned the nation by electing Senators Ossoff and Warnock to the US Senate, securing the forty-ninth and fiftieth seats for Democrats.

So, on January 6, Kim Allen, who’d worked those Georgia elections, went from celebrating a historic victory for democracy in Georgia to watching in horror as insurrectionists attacked our nation’s democracy on live television. And in the weeks and months that followed, those attacks on democracy continued, as Republicans promoted anti-voter laws and the likes of Bannon openly recruited thousands of poll watchers and poll workers to subvert democracy in state after state.

As a leader of the voter protection team at Georgia’s Democratic Party, Kim appreciated the danger more than most. She and her colleagues had worked tirelessly in 2020 to help Georgia voters overcome a maze of voting laws and cast their ballots—in a state ranked the second most difficult place to vote in America. Against all odds, and in the middle of the pandemic, that Georgia team saved enough votes to secure both President Biden’s victory and those surprising US Senate pick-ups.

So watching right-wingers like Bannon enlisting election deniers to become poll workers for future elections, Kim understood that the work to protect democracy was just beginning. Or, at least, _should_ be. But she also knew, as I learned in 2015, that this pro-democracy work has historically started and ended with campaigns. She’d seen voter protection programs close down after Election Day, leaving no dedicated staff at state Democratic parties to fight for democracy year-round.

But Kim had also just witnessed what happened when a state did the opposite. After 2018, Georgia became one of the first states to have a year-round voter protection program. That innovation helped to lay the groundwork for the pivotal elections in 2020—and that ultimately was one of the reasons why Georgia flipped blue when it did.

So, Kim and some of her Georgia colleagues decided to use their footprints to build on that new approach, founding an organization called **Power the Vote** to create permanent voter protection infrastructure.

In the two years since, Power the Vote has funded voter protection staff in five states—Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Florida, and Texas. Those staff are working on the ground to help voters cast their ballots and make their voices heard, while recruiting pro-democracy Americans to take on the very roles outlined above. And in the process, Power the Vote is helping to transform the culture of voter protection—from part-time to year-round, from reactive to proactive, and away from an almost singular focus on federal elections toward boosting elections statewide and at all levels. Always.

This is precisely the type of work we need to do to protect elections full-time, all the time. And it, too, needs to be scaled up.

**Messaging: Going on Offense for Democracy**

It is not light that we need, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake.

—Frederick Douglass, July 4, 1852

The core ideas and views of the side attacking American democracy are deeply unpopular. The side that supports democracy generally represents mainstream, majority viewpoints.

Which begs the question: _Why does the side that reflects the strong majority of Americans on most issues struggle so much in the messaging battle against the side mired in the minority?_

And how can those fighting _for_ democracy fare better in that battle?

Countless books, articles and podcasts debate these questions, putting forth a wide variety of (often conflicting) opinions. I won’t replay the entire conversation here. But let me highlight some key messaging takeaways from experts I respect and successful campaigns I’ve seen—takeaways that can help everyone from everyday activists to candidates win this messaging battle.

**_Their_ Strategy, and the Dilemma of Asymmetric Messaging**

Messaging strategist Rachel Bitecofer summed up the conundrum to me: “a fully radicalized party still holds 50 percent or more of our country’s political apparatus.” From a messaging standpoint, when their radicalism represents a decisive minority on most issues, how do they pull this off?

First, that “radicalized party” keenly understands where the American people stand on most issues—and on _their_ issues. They _know_ that if elections become straight-up-or-down referenda on their views and plans, their fate on election day will be that of the 2022 abortion referenda in Michigan, Kansas, and Kentucky: they will lose. . . everywhere.

Still, as Drew Westen, another messaging expert, explained to me, “they stick to their commitments. . . they are unafraid of taking positions that are minority positions if: 1) they firmly believe them; or 2) they are being well-paid to promulgate them.”

So, committed to a set of ideas that are largely unpopular, how do they effectively communicate _their_ agenda?

It’s actually a simple strategy: they don’t even try.

The fall of 2022 provided a perfect example. After the _Dobbs_ decision risked becoming the centerpiece of the 2022 election, they—the smart ones, at least—_understood_ its unpopularity. So much so that Mitch McConnell told Lindsey Graham not to talk about abortion, and candidates across the country scrubbed their websites of references to abortion bans they’d spent careers fighting for. From ducking tough questions to frantically changing the subject, they did all they could _not_ to talk about it.

In some states, the strategy worked. In others, things didn’t quiet down enough to succeed. Either way, their instinct for silence on _their_ agenda tells us a lot: they want to avoid a direct confrontation on positions they know are political losers.

So if they fall silent on the unpopular issues they care most about, what _do_ they talk about?

Democrats. Democrats. Democrats.

Their gameplan is attacking pro-democracy and Democratic candidates all the time. Ruthlessly. Relentlessly.

Bitecofer calls it an all-out “brand assault” against Democrats. Importantly, they choose messaging attacks that accomplish two goals _at the same time_: 1) to motivate their coalition (both their core voters and voters who lean their way) to show up at the polls on election day, and 2) to “pollute” the impression of Democratic and pro-democracy candidates among true swing voters.

Or, as messaging guru Anat Shenker-Osorio says, they pick issues and attack lines that “keep their base engaged and enraged.”[^31]

Take a step back, and you’ll see that this messaging strategy serves the same goal as the tactics and strategies described in prior chapters, such as gerrymandering and voter suppression. “The name of the game is driving and shaping the electorate in your favor and driving turnout in your party’s favor,” Bitecofer told me. _Because that’s the only way you win when you represent a minority viewpoint._

I saw this up close in the 2018 elections, with the late frenzy over a “caravan of immigrants” heading to America’s Southern border. It was a daily fear-mongering attack on Democrats with a simple goal: to spike Republican turnout in vast red areas of states like Ohio where voters were originally unmotivated. And it worked. That late surge wasn’t enough to stop a blue wave in suburbs that cost the GOP the House (again, it wasn’t meant to be persuasive), but that unexpected spike in rural turnout helped secure decisive statewide wins in states like Ohio, Florida, Missouri, and Indiana—where Republican candidates dramatically overperformed the final polls. (In Ohio, Governor Mike DeWine trailed in the final weeks amid a sleepy campaign, and Democratic turnout in cities was the highest in decades; but that red, rural surge propelled DeWine to a 3.7-point win.)

To use Bitecofer’s language, that “caravan turnout” in red Ohio and elsewhere shaped the electorate in ways the polling hadn’t captured. To use Shenker-Osorio’s language, it “engaged and enraged” as intended.

And how do the Democratic and pro-democracy candidates respond to this type of onslaught? They generally try to motivate their own coalition (again, core supporters and those who lean their way) and swing voters by _laying out policies they are confident are popular with the electorate_.

Author and activist Steve Phillips calls it “popularism.”[^32] Bitecofer calls it the “make shit popular” strategy, hoping to force the other side to act on issues that citizens widely support. And a common tactic accompanying this approach is to “make things as universally popular as possible by not branding them as partisan—we bleach all hint of partisanship out.”

And here’s the problem with that approach, and the overall back-and-forth:

![[f193-1.jpg]]

First, while the far right is furiously ginning up its turnout, a watered-down issue message from the left fails to motivate core Democratic supporters—“voters of color, who are the most reliable Democratic voters and the fastest growing segment of the population.”[^33] This is especially harmful with less engaged voters who need to be _persuaded_ to turn out.

Second, as Bitecofer told me, “if they’re talking about us, and we’re talking about us, _no one is messaging against them_.” As in so many other areas, while those _attacking democracy_ are on messaging _offense_, those who support democracy are not.

![[f194-1.jpg]]

And this explains why the left has not gained much political benefit _even when it succeeds_ in making its core ideas popular. For example, this asymmetry helps explain why states that strongly support a woman’s right to choose are voting _in_ candidates who’ve spent a lifetime backing abortion bans. Or why states whose voters strongly support lifting the minimum wage vote _into office_ those who oppose it. Or common-sense gun reforms. Or health issues like Medicaid expansion.

“They are voting to legalize pot and then voting for Republicans,” Bitecofer sums up perfectly.

**Ten Tips to _Go On Messaging Offense_**

So the side representing the minority is desperately avoiding a straight up-or-down vote on its unpopular core issues. It relentlessly defines the other side in ways that motivate its coalition to show up, while tearing down that side’s standing with true swing voters.

How _should_ the pro-democracy, majority side respond beyond popularism, and “making shit popular”?

Here are some key tips on how to go on offense:

1. Don’t Be Bullied—Remember, _They_ Are the Extremists

I see it happen all the time:

Far-right candidates attack those to their left on any number of issues, often to provoke a response or to change the subject from an issue where they feel vulnerable. Or, as with _Dobbs_, events out of their control thrust a hot-button issue forward. Convinced they may appear too partisan in front of a center-right electorate, Democratic candidates duck the hot topic. They pivot back to those popular “bread and butter” issues and away from the so-called culture war issue. After _Dobbs_, for example, some pundits warned candidates to “get back to the economy.” Some did.

My advice to those candidates and activists more broadly? Don’t get bullied into thinking you’re in the minority. Most of the time, on most issues, _they_ are the ones on shaky ground, not you. That’s why they gerrymander in the first place—and it’s why they scrub their websites. Even when they’ve chosen one hot-button issue to change the subject from another, that hot button issue is often just as unpopular. Banning books, for example, turns out to be _really_ unpopular.

Perhaps they’ve chosen a frame that feels robust. Maybe they’re saying it angrily or with powerful emotion. Maybe this is _the_ most important issue for some very vocal voters and interest groups. Or for Fox News, or talk radio. But time after time, the issues at the center of their agenda—and potentially ones they are attacking on—are mired in the deep minority.

Examples?

•  Banning abortion (unpopular in most states).

•  Even worse for them, banning abortion, no exceptions (that’s why the most perceptive ones were scrubbing their websites and ducking questions; that’s why Ohio officials tried to deny the story of a ten-year old rape victim being forced to go to Indiana to get abortion care).

•  Banning books and censoring history, including history of racial discrimination (Ohio and other states’ polls show that most voters trust teachers to get these judgments right).

•  Banning gay marriage or many forms of LGBTQ discrimination (in the minority at this point).

•  Permitless carry and no background checks (way underwater).

•  Election denying (check out Kari Lake and those secretary of state candidates).

And so on.

It turns out, the instinct to run away from these issues—to get back to “things people really care about” and “making shit popular”—is often a mistake. Many times, voters _do_ care about these issues, and they strongly disagree with the far right’s views. And some of these hot-button issues may be central to motivating the turnout we need to win.

To be clear, you don’t have to accept the way they’ve framed an issue. Don’t accept their terms of the debate. But you also don’t have to run away either. They are often leading with their chin.

What can you do instead?

2. Go on Offense:

**Take Their Extremism to Its Logical Conclusion**

Rather than being chased off by their extreme positions, Westen told me, “We should push them down _their own slippery slope . . ._ all the time.”

Take their stances to their most logical extremes. Their _toxic_ and _indefensible_ extremes.

Bitecofer advises the same: “We need to harvest the popularity” of our stances and use it _against_ extremists standing in the way. Create wedge issues that _they_ have to contend with_._

One concrete example: if you truly believe that life begins at conception, you can’t justify any exception for banning abortion beyond the life of the mother. Which is why most of the abortions bans in gerrymandered states lack exceptions. Given that reality, here’s how Westen suggests confronting today’s anti-abortion politician:

“_I believe every woman has the right to choose the father of her child. You believe that every rapist has the chance to choose the mother of his_.”

Now that’s a wallop. It also happens to be the logical extreme of their position. When I tweeted that simple quote after I first heard Westen say it, it went viral—retweeted more than five thousand times.

Or go to another logical extreme—that ardently pro-life politicians are thrusting themselves into intimate exam room conversations with doctors and patients. In his sole debate with John Fetterman, as soon as Mehmet Oz _accurately_ described that his anti-abortion stance placed the decision in the hands of “women, doctors and local political leaders,” his momentum tanked. The gaffe was so bad—the accurate articulation of his own position was so stark—it reignited the abortion battle around the country. (And to his credit, Fetterman never stopped talking about abortion access the entire campaign. Exit polls showed it was the most important issue in voters’ minds when they voted him in.)

Another Westen example: Once a politician grounds his position in his religious beliefs, as so many do explicitly these days, the response: “Your position is clear. . . you think you can push the rest of America to live by your religious creed.”

And perhaps the highest-profile example of this tactic of late was Joe Biden calling out the GOP position on Social Security in the 2023 State of the Union Speech. They were so uncomfortable, they felt the urge to shout back.

The bottom line is that those battling democracy are usually doing so precisely _because_ their toxic positions are too extreme for most Americans, and wouldn’t succeed in fair elections. Their anti-democracy push and extremism go hand-in-hand. But those on the left too often shirk from the debate over those underlying positions. Or, as Westen told me, “We poke around the edges. We retreat into our heads and think that that’s somehow effective.”

Instead, “We should speak forcefully every time they take these positions.” As Biden did, put _them_ on defense by showing how extreme and out-of-touch those positions really are.

**Focus on Indefensible Public Outcomes**

Beyond out-of-touch extremism, the other messaging opportunity that arises from the attack on democracy is that unaccountable and corrupted government _inevitably_ tanks public outcomes. Outcomes that impact everyday Americans in real ways. Outcomes that can’t be defended.

Why inevitably?

As I review in _Laboratories of Autocracy_ and Chapter 5, the decline of democracy in states results in the locking up of these governments by private interests, who seek private and narrow gain drawn from public goods and assets. With no accountability back to the public, the incentive system of these institutions warps, leading to the corrosion of public service, a broader corruption of the public space, and no brakes to stop the downward spiral.

![[f200-1.jpg]]

And _all of that_ inevitably leads to a dramatic decline in public outcomes for everyday Americans. From decaying infrastructure, to dying small towns, to regressive taxes, to sky-high student debt, to declining public health, to lower wages, to struggling schools. Some of the examples are outrageous: Brett Favre diverting money meant to lift poor Mississippians to build a volleyball stadium for his daughter’s team. Some are horrifying: Ohio’s legislature, awash in Norfolk Southern money, spending years blocking bills to improve safety on the state’s rail system.

_All of these negative consequences and more_ inevitably arise once unaccountable state government has been hijacked by extremists and private interests who aggressively seek gains _at the expense of the public_. Those paltry outcomes are essentially what the private interests are _purchasing_ from the politicians. That’s the grand bargain of these rigged and broken statehouses.

![[f201-1.jpg]]

So to go on offense for democracy, focus on those indefensible outcomes. And how you’ll fix them.

A great example is Laura Kelly’s successful run for governor in 2018 . . . in Kansas. Taking on Chris Kobach, a secretary of state who’d become nationally notorious for voter suppression efforts, then-State Senator Kelly had a treasure trove of material to use against Kobach from all his headline-grabbing controversies.

But when you watch her TV ads (google “Laura Kelly 2018 campaign” and you’ll see them for yourself), you’d hardly know Kobach had served in that post at all.

Instead, Kelly relentlessly talks about _Sam Brownback_, the sitting governor. And she focuses specifically on what she dubs his tax “experiment” and its consequences. . . _the decline of Kansas public schools_.[^34] Brownback had been the darling of the national right-wing by slashing Kansas’s income tax, but the approach disastrously defunded schools across the state—including reducing school to four days a week in some places.

And _that’s_ what Laura Kelly ran on. Even when her ads mention Kobach, they don’t address his controversial record as secretary of state—but that he’ll continue to fail Kansas schools, kids, and families just as Brownback had. On the strength of that message, she won. In Kansas. (She got reelected too, in 2022.)

I promise you, if your state is enduring a hijacked, extremist, and anti-democratic state government, there will be painful stories to tell about public outcomes collapsing just like in Kansas. Indefensible declines that everyday citizens feel directly. That they’re paying for dearly—through their pocketbooks, lost opportunity, lost security, environmental catastrophe, or even lives (e.g., the privatized power grid in Texas). All while someone like Brett Favre or some big business is benefiting.

Find the most potent examples, hammer away, and show how you’ll turn it around.

3. Lead with Values; Connect with Emotion

So those are two major-league messaging opportunities arising wherever democracy is under attack: toxic extremism and indefensible public outcomes. Together, a powerful arsenal of messaging ammunition. And if done right, messages that can appeal to all corners of a state.

But then the next question arises: _how_ do we talk about those things effectively?

Let’s bring Drew Westen back: “They [the anti-democracy far right] always lead with values and we always lead with issues. We are so intellectualized that we talk about issues and policies and numbers ad nauseam.” The problem is that’s not how people make important decisions, like who to vote for.

What _we should do:_ “Lead with your values—once you get people to feel what you feel, they’ll listen to what you say.”

_Start. With. Values._ That’s where the meaningful connection is made.

Westen suggests that when communicating, think about your message along two perpendicular lines.

One line measures the truth of a message.

A second line measures the emotional appeal—the underlying values—of a message.

![[f204-1.jpg]]

A demagogue like Trump occupies one corner of this diagram—always advancing a message with strong emotional appeal, anchored in values shared with his coalition. The fact that it’s almost entirely false doesn’t matter. As Bannon famously said: “[F]lood the zone with shit.”[^35]

Countering that message from the opposite corner—with the truth, but lacking values or any emotional appeal—is a losing, if all too common, response.

What’s the ideal message? Westen: “Tell the truth in a way that’s emotionally evocative and speaks to people’s values.”

What’s an example?

“_I believe every woman has the right to choose the father of her child. You believe that every rapist has the chance to choose the mother of his_.”

Or:

_“We believe health decisions should come down to a woman and her doctor. They believe the decision over abortion should come down to women, doctors, and local political leaders.”_

Polling may confirm that the extreme right’s position of banning abortion, with no exceptions, is one that few Americans agree with. But Westen’s line and Oz’s gaffe offer perfect examples of how to deliver that popular message (truthfully) with an emotional and values-laden punch.

Another simple Westen example: reframe Washington’s never-ending debate over the “debt ceiling.” Many Americans instinctual response to that framing is that debt is bad, so a ceiling on debt sounds like a good thing. Raising that debt limit higher will strike many as a bad thing.

So reframe it, leading with values: call it the “pay your bills act,” Westen suggests. One value Americans share is that responsible people pay their bills. Families too. So should the government.

Or go back to those winning ads run by Laura Kelly. Watch them closely. Through _resources/books//Saving Democracy_ A User's Manual for Ever - David Pepper and words, they _always_ open with _values_. Kansas values, and her values. Kansas communities, families, and kids. Parents. Then she describes the damage done to those Kansas values by Brownback’s reckless tax “experiment”: Brownback “attacked what makes Kansas special,” Kelly tells Kansans.[^36] It was “an attack on who we are as Kansans.”[^37] Kobach will do the same thing, she assures us. Then she promises to fix it.

When you’re done watching the ads, it’s clear that to protect Kansas values, you better stand with Laura Kelly.

Or take a look at Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s 2018 ads. She’s driving down a road in Michigan—a road marked by potholes. Roads like that have damaged her own car, she explains to camera. It’s time, she implores, “to fix the damn roads.”[^38]

This is not a policy message. It’s not saying the words “infrastructure” or “transportation policy,” or laying out complex facts. It’s connecting by packing emotion into her message—with one (damn) word.

Michigan news stations then questioned whether her use of the word “damn” was appropriate. Whitmer’s response: “[T]he fact of the matter is, that’s how people across the state _feel_ about our roads. And talk about our roads.”[^39]

Perfect.

Voters are pissed off, she knows it, and she’s pissed off too.

She’s made an emotional connection.

“Fix the _damn_ roads_.”_ You can just see viewers at home, nodding their heads, mouthing the words back at the television set.

4. Explain How It Impacts _You_ (the Audience)

But Whitmer’s ad also does something else.

Before the money line about the “damn roads,” she talks about _real_ money. The _viewer’s_ money: “[t]he average driver spends over $500 a year to fix their cars. I just replaced this windshield for the second time in two years. As governor, I want to focus on the things that will actually make a difference in people’s lives right now, like fixing the damn roads.”

She’s making the message relevant to every Michigander. _They_ are all paying the price for a broken Michigan. And every viewer who’s had to pay money to fix her car because of the damn roads just figured out _why—_and why it matters to them.

Whitmer explained her choice of roads amid all the topics she could’ve talked about (the big national debate that year was about healthcare): “It’s the most obvious failure of state government that we all confront and that we’re all paying for.”[^40] Exactly—she picked something that impacts everybody, and the ad makes that negative impact explicit.

Same thing with Laura Kelly.

One of her education ads opens with photos of children walking to school. A narrator says, “The moment _you_ send them off, _you_ know a big part of their life is about to be shaped.” Then she pivots back to the Brownback education cuts—he “sacrificed our schools to pay for his big tax experiment. . . . I’m running for Governor to undo that harm. I want parents to feel comfort every day, knowing we’re doing right by their kids.”[^41]

Like Whitmer, she’s making it clear how the paltry outcomes in the state are impacting individual voters, and all parents watching. Risking their/“your” family’s future.

The bottom line: the best messaging makes the connection of how the extremism and poor outcomes aren’t negative in the abstract, but how they pose a “threat to you and yours” (in Bitecofer’s words)—which they do on issue after issue.

Make _that_ impact explicit. Make it personal.

5. _Name_ Who’s Doing It

Bitecofer adds another key element, building off those above—you can’t just say what’s being done to you, “You gotta say _who’s_ doing it to you.”

Not naming who’s doing it lets them off the hook. It’s precisely why voters who strongly support a woman’s right to choose are, at the same time, voting _for_ candidates who’ve spent a lifetime backing abortion bans.

Back to Laura Kelly. Her ads are all about values, and she’s made those values relevant to each viewer. But she closes the circle by naming Brownback in virtually every ad: “Sam Brownback’s massive education cuts weren’t numbers on a spreadsheet. They were an attack on who we are as Kansans.”[^42]Then when she names her opponent, she ties him back to Brownback: “[W]hen Chris Kobach promises tax cuts, he _really_ means he’ll bring back the Brownback experiment and make it even worse.”[^43]

Whitmer does the same in her ads: “I’ve had it with Republicans like Donald Trump blowing up healthcare while your costs go up and up, and because it’s about time we fix the damn roads.”[^44]

You have to “make it about them,” Bitecofer says. But you can’t make it about them unless you make clear who _they_ are.

6. Messaging on Democracy Itself

This is a book about democracy, but so far, this chapter has _not_ mentioned messaging _about democracy_ explicitly. And that’s not an accident: messaging about “democracy” risks running afoul of much of the messaging guidance above.

Rhetoric and debate on democracy and voting can quickly plunge into debates about processes and facts that voters tune out. And for voters who vote without much delay or problem—which is most of them—it may not feel relevant to their lives. It’s someone else’s problem, if they even think it’s a problem. More broadly, when folks lob high-octane accusations about democracy, “hypocrisy,” and “corruption” at one another, many voters tune it out as something _all politicians_ do.

There’s also a double-edged sword in debating democracy directly. A big chunk of voters don’t feel that America’s present-day democracy is serving them well, if at all, so righteous cries about “democracy” don’t resonate. On the flip side, others are so confident in American democracy, they dismiss messages warning that it is under threat.

“I wouldn’t tell anyone to run on the word ‘democracy,’” Anat Shenker-Osorio told me. “Democracy itself as a word is just way too intangible for people.”

Instead, she says, “Run on ‘_democracy issues_’ without calling it that.”

First, wrap the conversation with values, and explicitly, a broader conversation about freedom. “In America we value our freedom.” Make it clear that “one side is trying to take away our freedoms.”

Which freedoms?

•  “The freedom to cast our votes and pick our leaders”

•  “The freedom to decide for yourself who governs in your name”

•  “The freedom to pick your leaders; not the politicians picking their voters”

•  “Freedom about whether or not we have kids.”

Also, don’t settle on an argument that one side is fighting democracy and leave it at that. Make clear that that side is “anti-democratic _to advance an agenda you don’t want_,_”_ Michael Podhorzer told me. Make it about the extremism and paltry outcomes that inevitably arise from the weakened democracy they seek.

And connect elections to everyday issues that are top of mind for voters, who largely worry about getting through their day. Shenker-Osorio: “It’s really about giving people a visceral sense that democracy is where you live, what you get to eat, what’s in your retirement fund, the kind of education your kids will get at school. Otherwise, it’s too abstract for people.”

And whatever you do, “don’t bring process arguments to an outcome fight.”

The 2022 elections provide a good example of all this coming together to defy midterm history—in some races, at least.

Between the January 6 hearings, television commentary, extremist election deniers running for office, and even a presidential speech late in the cycle, there _was_ an extended conversation about democracy over the course of the year. But the _Dobbs_ decision and the debate that followed were key to linking that democracy discussion to deeper concerns about freedom and toxic extremism. It also grounded the democracy and freedom debate in something tangible. _Dobbs_, according to Podhorzer, “chrystalized that this was a political party that wants to take away your right to choose. . . and who knows what’s next.” Shenker-Osorio: abortion became “the salient exemplar of the right-wing ideology to take away your freedoms.”

So connecting it all together was key for those who succeeded. That’s what John Fetterman did. That’s what Gretchen Whitmer did in Michigan. That’s what Raphael Warnock did in Georgia.

In the final days of his successful campaign, Josh Shapiro tied both abortion and voting rights into the broader theme of freedom. “We’re fighting every day for real freedom,” he said in speeches. “Banning abortion isn’t freedom,” he tweeted. “Telling folks that their vote doesn’t count isn’t freedom.”[^45]

And in those states where election-denying secretary of state candidates were on the ballot, their opponents and groups like DASS didn’t limit their ads to democracy or the process of voting. They, too, went broader.

For example, the leader of the election deniers running for secretary of state was Jim Marchant in Nevada. One ad against him asked: “Who would you trust to protect your freedoms? Jim Marchant says he wants to end early voting and vote by mail. To control elections for himself and his allies. Marchant supported an abortion ban with no exception for rape. . . ”[^46]

Across the country, Shenker-Osorio told me, connecting concerns about democracy to abortion “made it clear that this was not crying wolf.”

Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes’ general election ad painted with a broader brush, but accomplished the same goal. The ad opens by touting Arizona values—patriotism and an “independent spirit”—then tags his opponent Mark Finchem as a “dangerous extremist” who would “destroy our legacy,” as _resources/books//Saving Democracy_ A User's Manual for Ever - David Pepper of January 6 appear on the screen.[^47] As Podhorzer recommended above—the ad is making clear that Finchem is “anti-democratic _to advance an agenda you don’t want.”_

These same principles apply in messaging around _voting itself._ Those attacking voting rights are well aware that debates around voter suppression often lead down a rabbit hole of complex processes, myths of fraud, and a confusing mess of facts. They’re good at muddying the waters, or narrowing the debate so most voters don’t care because it doesn’t impact them directly. All of this makes those debates hard to win.

So do what you can to bring those debates back to _values_.

Examples:

On **gerrymandering** (Shenker-Osorio)_: “In America, voters pick our leaders. Our leaders shouldn’t get to pick which voters to hear and which voters to silence.”_

On **suppression** that targets certain populations (Shenker-Osorio)_: “All of us should have equal say in decisions that make a difference in our lives.”_

On **election denialism** (Westen)_—_tie it back to the simple values frame that American does not like or respect sore losers. _“When you lose, you shake hands and move on. We all learned that in kindergarten. What’s wrong with you?”_

And then make clear that attempts at suppression **impact everyone** (Westen):

“The ways that Democrats talk about voter suppression—we are always unintentionally _otherizing_ the people we want people to be concerned about.” Make it about everyone whenever possible. “Tie the process of voting back to outcomes—what will this do to _you_ and the people you care about?”

Examples:

On **suppression** generally: _“Had there been more voter suppression in 2020, we would’ve had Trump as president for a second term. It was that close. If the vote of thousands is taken out of the mix, you lose. So suppressions affects all of you. It affects your choice in the election._”

On **“dark money”:** “_You are having your home taken away because they want to keep making money for oil. Do you want to continue that?”_

On **suppression targeting young voters**: “_Is it really OK to make it harder for your kids to vote? If you and your kid agree on things, and your kid doesn’t get to vote, your vote just got cancelled out._”

And focus on the way specific forms of voter suppression **make it harder for everyone to vote**. Attacks on voting by mail and drop boxes inconvenience _everyone_. Semedrian Smith, the national campaigns director for the Democratic Association for Secretaries of State, told me research made clear that “[f]olks were up in arms about taking away their vote by mail. . . . [Their response:] ‘don’t make my life harder.’”

7. Responding to Dog Whistle Messaging

It’s a tactic that goes back to our nation’s Founding. To advance an agenda that most of the population disagrees with—to “shape” the electorate in your favor—you need to divide that otherwise united majority over something else.

And the candidate for “something else” too often turns out to be race. So time and again, the far right’s attack on democracy comes wrapped in an unvarnished appeal to racial prejudices, stereotypes, fear, and outright racism. Dividing people who otherwise have all sorts of commonalities (like wanting better-funded schools or smooth roads or safe rails) against one another.

For years, we referred to these appeals as “dog whistles.” Lately, the tactics have grown so egregious, they’re just plain whistles—loud enough that everyone hears them. And too often, they _still_ work. And one reason they work is an ineffective response.

For too long, the response to those dog whistles has been silence. Ignore it, and “get back” to the issues. That is a failed strategy.

Why?

Anat Shenker-Osorio explains: “Politics isn’t solitaire. . . . The right-right-wing is going to be race-baiting all day, every day. . . . [T]his idea that somehow we can be silent about race and the race conversation just disappears is a pure fallacy.”[^48]

If we are silent, she explains, “all our voters hear is the racially coded invectives from the opposition.”[^49]

The best response is to actually call the tactic out head-on, then get back to values.

“[C]all out the opposition for what they are doing and _how_ they are intentionally dividing by race and by place in order to aid and abet their plutocracy. . . [A]scribe motivation. . . explain why they are doing it,” and why “that [division] is going to screw you over.”[^50]

![[f217-1.jpg]]

8. Our Meta-Message

For good and for bad, we project powerful messages way beyond the words we use. Drew Westen calls it our “meta-message”—what we communicate from our action or inaction, and the urgency with which we act. That meta-message becomes especially important as rhetoric heats up and the political battle becomes highly charged.

Think about it this way: less political or less engaged Americans are watching fierce back-and-forth rhetorical battles play out on issues as profound as democracy and the rule of law. The words are at a fever-pitch. At some point, unsure of who to believe amid all that rancor, many may tune out the war of words—but they’re still making judgments based on other cues. That’s where meta-messaging comes in. And a meta-message that is inconsistent with a heated verbal message could be the ultimate tiebreaker in who those watching believe.

Here’s an example: Many Democrats spent much of 2021 bemoaning state attacks on voting rights as a dire threat to democracy. (I was one of them—it’s why I wrote _Laboratories_ in the first place.) But a Senate debate and a vote to protect voting rights didn’t occur until January 2022. When it finally came, it felt like the Senate was largely going through the motions. And after that vote failed to overcome the filibuster, no debate occurred for the rest of the term. Hardly earned a mention.

![[f218-1.jpg]]

To many Americans, the meta-message from that long-delayed and half-hearted Senate effort spoke far more loudly than the fierce rhetoric about democracy and voting rights coming from some quarters: _if you **really** think democracy is under attack, you’d do something about it. You’d fight hard! Since you’re not doing much about it, it must not be that bad._

Here’s another: We labelled January 6 an insurrection—an attack against democracy. Members of Congress were involved in its planning, and many voted against certifying the election early the next morning. But those members never faced accountability for their actions—for the most part, accountability wasn’t even _attempted_. Almost all of those involved got reelected, and now they enjoy the majority. As Westen put it to me, “Now we have a House run by coup attempters.”

To many Americans trying to make sense of it all, the meta-message from this sequence comes through loud and clear: _if you really thought they were part of an illegal and criminal insurrection, you would at least try to do something about it. There would be accountability. Since you didn’t even try, it must not be that bad—especially when we see action taken immediately in other countries._

More broadly, we find ourselves in a time where increasingly disturbing tactics are threatening democracy. The violation of laws. Intimidation of voters. Extremism. Violence. Talk of a national “divorce.” Responding to all of this with a “politics as usual” meta-message risks normalizing it all.

Beyond the general role of meta-messages, certain audiences interpret those meta-messages in ways that drive their own future actions.

Whatever words you may use, if a _bully_ never sees you do a thing to hold him accountable, the meta-message sent is clear. Westen, again: “When you appease, the message you send to a bully is that you’re weak, and they’ll go after you again.” That has been a consistent theme of the last decade. Bullies get more aggressive when they detect cowardice and no accountability. They don’t just keep going—_they go further_.

And if you cower to that bully, those watching that showdown also take note: “The message you send by cowardice is that you’re a coward, and no one votes for a coward. People vote for the people who show conviction in their firmest beliefs.”

Finally, think of the audience that tends to agree with you, but is unsure if it’s worth leaving their comfort zone to get in the fight. If _they_ see cowardice, or hesitation, most will decide it’s not worth the risk, or their sacrifice. If the champions of the cause aren’t going all in, why should they?

As a contrast, think about the meta-message sent by John Lewis. Or Rhoda Denison Bement, so incensed she was banished from her own church. And so many like them. Their lifetimes of action were consistent with their fierce rhetoric. They never stopped. They took risks. They never backed down. _That_ conviction and persistence and courage comprised a robust meta-message, and legions joined them in what began as impossible fights.

And in April 2023, look at how the nation responded to the “Tennessee Three” when they stood boldly against the gerrymandered Tennessee legislature that voted to oust them. They fought back fiercely, and woke up the country about how broken these legislatures are. The same thing happened after Michigan State Senator Mallory McMorrow spoke up so forcefully in 2022.

Democracy is under attack. In tone and action, and in everything we do, our meta-message must be consistent with that growing threat, along with the words we use to describe it.

9. “Mobi-suasion”: Persuading Voters to Show Up

Above, I explained that the far right uses messaging to _shape the electorate_. To get its coalition “engaged and enraged” so it shows up and numerically overwhelms the other side, which in many places is larger.

Too often, Democrats and those fighting for democracy take a different, less effective tack: they push more sanitized messages to persuade voters in the middle, then frantically knock on doors and make calls late in a campaign to remind their own coalition to show up. They separate message from mobilization.

This approach is based on an assumption that those coalition members are primed to vote—already persuaded of voting’s importance—and if they just hear enough reminders about election day and who the candidates are, they’ll show up.

But for too many of those voters, this assumption doesn’t hold. Unfortunately, many live challenging lives—and are disengaged precisely _because_ they don’t believe voting will change much in their lives for the good. (Lived experience has likely taught them that lesson.) Or because the issues they see bandied about in politics won’t make much difference for them. So voting—especially in states that have added obstacles or legal uncertainty to the process—just doesn’t feel worth the time, money, and effort. And those milquetoast messages and frantic door knocks do nothing to change that.

“You have to treat them as _persuasion voters_,” Stacy Abrams explained to _Politico_ after Georgia turned blue in 2020.[^51] “Only your message is not trying to persuade them to share Democratic values. Your message is to persuade them that voting can actually yield change.” Change generally, and change in their own lives.

Almost the entire explanation of the outcomes in 2018, 2020, and 2022 comes down to fluctuations in turnout. So core messages must reflect that need to persuade folks to turn out—both at the macro-level, and the micro-level (doors and phones). Some call this need “mobili-suasion” (Tech for Campaigns’ CEO Gina Pak) or “mobi-suasion.” (Shenker-Osorio). Whatever you call it, do it!

And this need also places an enormous premium on. . .

10. . . . Repetition

Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.

There is no greater power in messaging than repetition.

And it’s not just because people hear the message more often, or are more likely to hear it at all.

Done right, repetition changes _how_ people hear the message. And from whom they hear it.

Shenker-Osorio explains: “[t]he number one most persuasive tool in our arsenal. . . is something that we call social proof. . . .[P]eople do the thing they think people _like them_ do. . . . Whatever [people hear] repeated most frequently becomes ‘common sense. . . .’”[^52]

Which means “there’s nothing that we can say that is as persuasive as what people see other people doing.” And saying. If you keep hearing it around town, “this must be what people like me think”.[^53]

This dynamic explains how strong opinions on issues can arise overnight, or shift quickly, as they did on marriage equality. Or that caravan cooked up by Donald Trump and Fox News:

_If everyone in my town is talking about that caravan—in restaurants, at the store, at the barber shop, at work—then it must be real and it must be something I should care about._

The importance of repetition puts a premium on creating and using messages that spread: “[a] message is like a baton that has to be passed from person to person to person,” Shenker-Osorio says.[^54] “[I]f your words don’t spread, they don’t work. . . And if your base is unwilling to carry a message. . . [and] no one in your base is going to say it, then the middle’s not gonna hear it.”[^55]

Back to Tip 9, this same repetition/social proof dynamic also plays a key role in persuading folks to turn out and vote: “Voters need to feel like voting is a thing that ‘my kind of a person’ does. It’s an habituated behavior.” So it’s key to “create the environment that this is a thing that everyone is paying attention to—this is a thing that everyone is thinking about.”

Formal studies confirm her observation: “There is a great deal of literature relating the habits of voters to other potential voters in their familial and social circles. . . . Connectedness matters. . . . The main finding in this line of research indicates that voting can be contagious; the more people in your network who vote, the more likely you are to vote.”[^56]

Which leads to two needs:

Once again, to create the most effective message—one likely to spread widely—it’s not good enough to win over the moderate middle with a milquetoast message. It may be appealing when heard in a vacuum, but it doesn’t _spread_. You need a message that your core coalition finds so compelling, it repeats it endlessly. The magnetism of the message is what gets that baton passed around. Sadly, that 2018 fake news about a caravan possessed that exact feature. On the other hand, messages that signal that “you’re a B-version of your opponent do not,” Shenker-Osorio told me.

Second, to ensure a message spreads, “[w]e have to actually do the _work_ of organizing,” Shenker-Osorio says.[^57] “[O]rganizing is the only route to messaging. . . . [T]he unsexy work of going door to door to door, phone to phone to phone, text to text to text, talking to people.”[^58]

Sure, media outlets and TV ads and podcasts and streaming videos can help. But, consistent with the rest of this book, the most important part of spreading the word so that’s it’s heard from a variety of people is that every American who cares about democracy must use her footprint to communicate. And organizations must empower every member or constituent to do the same.

Which brings all this messaging advice right back to you.

**Your Tools to Pass the Baton**

The good news is, in this day and age, there are so many ways Americans can use their footprint to communicate their story or amplify others’. Every American can pass that baton in more ways than ever before.

Your Voice

Your direct voice is the single best tool you have. One-on-one. In groups. Casually. Formally. On the phone. At doors.

Whatever the method of delivery, research confirms that “[p]ersonalized methods and messages work better. Across a number of mobilization experiments, one consistent finding is that more personalized messages are more effective in mobilizing voters.”[^59]

Which is to say, your own voice matters. Your authentic voice. Use it.

Your Written Word

**Letters to the Editor:** people still read them, and they now are often shared online as well. Keep writing them, using all the tips and tools above. One breakthrough frame in one letter to the editor can do a lot of motivating or persuading. Yet another baton.

**Postcards:** personalized postcards have become a great way to cut through the impersonal mail that usually arrives in your mailbox. Each one can be that baton if done right.

Memes, Visuals, and Videos

When it comes to the message ammunition I describe above, memes, visuals, and videos can convey powerful messaging, and they often get shared more readily than simple words.

I often film myself filling out whiteboards breaking down an element of democracy. It’s amazing how the addition of that simple visual leads to more views and shares. Similarly, pictures and videos I’ve shared of decaying towns in Ohio have quickly gone viral around the country because they capture the decline of towns seen in so many states. They generate an emotional response more than most descriptions I could write—so much so that people share them widely with their own messages added.

When we all have cameras in our phones, there are so many ways to document and share powerful stories. And when it comes directly from you, it’s more authentic. Don’t overproduce it. Just make it naturally—your lens, your voice—and get it out there.

Gina Pak, CEO of Tech for Campaigns, says research confirms the effectiveness of self-generated content: “Is it authentic? Does the messenger look like the population you’re trying to appeal to? Can you communicate effectively the message you’re trying to get across?” If the answers are yes, it works, Pak told me. So get started.

It’s no accident that user-generated content is one of the most effective tools that the private sector now harnesses to market products. It’s one consumer talking to other consumers. It’s word of mouth. It’s “social proof.” It’s baton-passing in a personal and authentic way.

Your Meta-Message

Finally, think about your own meta-message.

Amid the growing extremism, and the broad attack on so many of our pro-democracy norms, silence is exactly the meta-message those attacking democracy want from us. A collective shrug communicates that we are OK with it all. That we see it as normal. That we accept it.

Beyond silence, being overly polite in the face of outrageous actions can also send the wrong meta-message. On some occasions, as Frederick Douglass said when asked to speak on July 4, “It is not light that we need, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder.”[^60]

I consider myself a civil, polite person. That’s how I carried myself in office, and in almost all of my social and professional encounters. But if I testify in front of a group of people trying to rig democracy to advance their extremist agenda, my tone is going to reflect my anger. I’m going to draw upon my Rhoda Denison Bement roots. I’m not going to leave them with the false impression—through my words or tone—that what they are doing is within the spectrum of “normal” politics. Nor do I want those watching me to think that either.

Again, the wrong meta-message impacts three audiences: those doing the attacking see it as an invitation to keep going, because there’s no resistance and no accountability. Those who are less engaged read from the meta-message: this is all no big deal. No one seems alarmed. This must be the new normal. Those tempted to fight back: if even the die-hards aren’t fighting, I won’t either.

Don’t let any of those audiences come to those conclusions.

**Use Your Entire Footprint**

While door-knocking and letters to the editor and phone calls really matter, those are generally shotgun-style communications. Again, it’s within _your own footprint_ that your communications will be most impactful.

So think about all the channels in your footprint you can use to communicate.

**Friends and Family**: remember the DeLoaches. They affirmatively chose to have face-to-face conversations and other communications (lots of texting) within their networks. They told their own stories about why voting mattered to them, and why they hoped those in their social network would expand the conversation from there. An incredible effort all started from their individual voices. And in their network, they accomplished the repetition that really matters. Within a wide network, they built an echo chamber of “social proof” that changes behavior.

![[f229-1.jpg]]

**Neighborhoods:** from formal party precinct executives to active community members, working your own street, block, and community is a tangible, achievable footprint within which to communicate.

**Residents:** live in an apartment complex? Start talking. Start communicating.

**Church:** start a conversation with fellow parishioners.

**Workplace/Unions:** many workplaces lend themselves to conversations about how to lift democracy—amongst the workforce, or with customers and clients. Example: I’ve seen law firms in Ohio—who represent large numbers of victims— send out letters to all those clients explaining what’s at stake in an upcoming election.

**Social media:** Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, LinkedIn—use whichever ones you’re on to get the word out. Most who follow or “friend” you do so because they know you and/or respect your view. So all of these channels can contribute to the “baton” model described above within a network of people who already know you. The more people hear the same thing repeated within and across their various networks, the more impactful it is.

**Become an “Information Warrior”**

Long-time activist Simon Rosenberg was part of the famous 1992 Bill Clinton “war room,” which helped propel the former Arkansas governor to his underdog presidential victory. The goal of that twenty-five-person war room, Rosenberg says, was “to win the information war every day.”[^61]

That still must be the goal today. Every day.

On one hand, winning every day has gotten harder, because as Rosenberg describes, a “networked and amplified” far right has constructed “systems to move their arguments out into the ether 24/47/365.”[^62] Y’know—Fox News, OAN, talk radio, social media, podcasts, and the like. And their willingness to propagate disinformation into the world has only grown more extreme, especially when they profit from it.

On the other hand, winning every day has gotten _easier_. Because while a mere twenty-five people huddled in that Clinton war room thirty years ago, technology today allows _millions_ to be in our war room _for_ democracy.

Even better, _you_ are in that war room if you choose to be.

“[W]e have to start becoming conscious about being information warriors,” Rosenberg says.[^63] “[W]e have to reimagine the war room today [as] millions of Democrats networked, wired together, amplifying messages, and being much louder than we are now. . . . If four million people on our side reach another ten to twenty people every day, that’s forty-, fifty-million contacts a day. . .That’s loud.”[^64]

But this won’t happen on its own. And it won’t happen through political campaigns alone, on which we’ve become over-dependent.

“[I]t has to become something intentional for us on our side,” Rosenberg explains. “They’re operating every day. . . . _We_ have to operate every day.”[^65]

Individually, “we need to get much more serious about being in this thing 24/7/365. . . . [M]ake these arguments to your networks and your communities, and together. . . we can drown out the right-wing noise machine.”[^66]

Intentional.

Every day.

To your networks and communities.

In other words, use as much of your footprint as you can.

**Statehouse Advocacy: “You are more POWERFUL than you think”**

Each one of us must realize the necessity of our personal interest, not only toward our fellow citizens, but in the government itself. You must watch, as a public duty, what is done and what is not done at Albany. You must understand the issues that arise in the Legislature. . . .

—Gov. (NY) Franklin Delano Roosevelt  
First Inaugural Address, 1929

After Donald Trump was elected, countless Americans decided to do _something_.

In January 2017, millions of women marched in Washington, DC. More than one hundred thousand Americans returned months later for the March for Science. Others protested immigration crackdowns at airports across the nation. Folks joined or formed local grassroots groups around the country, protesting their members of Congress on a weekly basis. Some ran for office for the first time; still others collected signatures to reform state constitutions. And so much more.

In those months, Toledo native Rachel Coyle decided that she, too, would do something. But her choice of _what to do_ was different than most.

Before the Trump presidency, in her early twenties, Rachel had worked both at the Ohio Statehouse and on campaigns. So she learned up close of the immense power that legislatures have over issues everyday Ohioans care about, and over democracy itself. But she also learned something else: too few people understand that state legislative power, or how legislatures work day to day.

So when Rachel decided to “do something” after Trump won, it was to address _that_ problem. She and a friend and colleague told themselves: “Hey—we could teach people about the statehouse. That’s a skill we have.” Specifically, watching political angst boil up all around in early 2017, they designed a simple training program to help. They called it “How Things Work at the Statehouse.” Given how few people paid attention to statehouse activity, they booked a meeting space next to a Columbus bar—capacity, fifty people. They then advertised the session through activist circles and via social media.

Within days, one thousand people signed up.

They kept the original location for that first session, while scheduling the next 950 people to attend sessions in larger locations in the weeks that followed. And from there, the original idea of a one-time training evolved into a roving series of sessions all over Ohio. The first takers were the same activist groups that had sprouted up in response to Trump. Word spread, and more requests from those groups came in. Then traditional county party organizations and clubs reached out, followed by other organizations with a variety of public and civic agendas—the ACLU, Moms Demand Action, Junior League chapters, and others. Rachel has now led hundreds of trainings across the state. Until recently, she did this all as a “hobby,” scheduled around her paid political jobs.

Her training sessions not only explained how Ohio’s legislature operates, but how individuals and groups can most effectively advocate there. Along the way, Rachel started a Facebook group—which now boasts more than ten thousand members—expanded her Twitter account, and opened new Instagram and TikTok accounts. In time, the initial concept of training blossomed into a permanent advocacy infrastructure aimed squarely at the long-ignored Ohio legislature.

Needless to say, Rachel provides an inspiring example of one person using her footprint to mount a major-league fight for democracy. And what she has built occupies critical but often overlooked turf in that fight—turf we need to claim in every state in the country.

Why is Rachel’s statehouse advocacy so important? First, she’s drawing desperately needed attention to a level of politics where so much of the attack on democracy is taking place, under the radar. Second, she’s bringing the voice of everyday people to an institution that too rarely hears that voice. And third, she’s bringing some measure of direct accountability to an otherwise gerrymandered and unaccountable world.

**Rachel’s Takeaways**

What Rachel told me she’s learned along the way is helpful to every American concerned about the state of our democracy:

**First—**_“You are more POWERFUL than you think. . . . Your voice is a lot louder than you think it is at the state legislature.”_

Why?

Most statehouses rarely hear from everyday citizens. Rachel recalls her days as a staff member: “I saw how few people called our offices. Our phones would sit silent for hours. But I also saw how one person who got angry and called a lot could get something done, because so few people contacted us. And when people did make noise, they often got what they wanted.”

State legislative offices are far smaller than those in Congress—for the most part, one or two staff members answer calls, open emails, and check messages. A savvy advocate can get to know those staffers on an individual basis (Rachel’s advice—be polite), which can make them far more effective.

Then throw in the fact that these are politicians who rarely face opposition back home, or critical media coverage (if there’s coverage at all). Which means “they’re very uncomfortable with public pushback.”

Add it all up, and even as an individual advocate, YOU can make a difference when you advocate at the state legislative level. Make it an organized effort, even more so. “It doesn’t take many voices to have them feel like the whole state is calling.” Like they’ve stepped into something big. Something viral.

And for those of you who feel outnumbered in red districts, know that your voice carries special weight in state-level advocacy. Legislators from conservative areas don’t expect calls from their own districts. “They always tell themselves that all the pushback is from liberals from the big cities.” When you and your neighbors show up from a red district, you disrupt that comfort.

**Second—**_“They don’t like the attention. So bring it to them.”_

Done right, unwanted attention can kill bad bills.

Despite being outnumbered in the legislature, Rachel can point to numerous bills that died in part from powerful advocacy efforts.

Remember that awful Ohio bill from Chapter 5 requiring genital inspections of young athletes? Spirited advocacy and media scrutiny stirred up national headlines as the bill emerged from the House. So much so, state senators didn’t want to touch it, and it died. Numerous attacks on public education, along with book bans and right-wing school curriculum bills, have suffered similar fates, abandoned after loud protests and widespread, well-covered controversy.

Bills impacting the economic well-being of everyday Americans can also die quickly if exposed. One Ohio legislator—himself a landlord—introduced a bill allowing tenant evictions on weekends and holidays. Rachel and her team flagged it early, smartly labelled it “The Scrooge Act,” and defeated both attempts to get it passed—once in the House, once in the Senate.

But these moments don’t happen on their own. It takes energized, well-executed advocacy to push a controversial issue or bill into the public spotlight. Phone calls. In-person testimony. Press conferences. Rallies. Letters to the editor back in districts, then amplified on social media. Even direct citizen responses to legislators’ tweets, or comments on posts legislators make on social media (“they are very conscious of those”), can make a difference. Add it all up, and “they feel like the whole state is watching.” And that negative attention can make the difference.

One lesson: pushed to defend bad bills by the media, legislators (again, not used to criticism) often make things far worse when forced to defend their handiwork. A young Ohio legislator tried to defend her school curriculum bill by suggesting to a local reporter that “both sides” of the Holocaust would be taught—and the days of national scrutiny that followed killed that bill. A state senator tried to defend slashing rural broadband by saying Ohioans in rural areas didn’t know how to use computers. . . and that was the end of that bill.

Of course, Rachel and other advocates did what they could to make these blunders go viral, knowing every _other_ legislator would see the scrutiny and run for cover. But to put them on defense in the first place takes proactive advocacy. Silence at the front end usually means there’s no story at all.

One of Rachel’s tips to doing all this well is that “early awareness is key.” So, keep an eye on committee agendas, and sign up to receive them automatically if your statehouse provides for that. The earlier you can frame an issue and start planning your response, the better.

**Third—**_“If you don’t, someone else will”_—Advocacy Shapes the Narrative

Savvy advocacy at the legislature—where the statewide press corps is camped out—can shape the broader narrative of the state, far beyond individual pieces of legislation. And if _you’re_ not doing that narrative-shaping, Rachel warns, someone else will.

The pandemic provided a clear example of this. In early 2020, Ohio was cruising along with a bipartisan response to COVID, led by a Republican governor and a popular health director. Ohioans were glued to their television sets for daily briefings, paying close attention to every new health order and heeding advice on how to stay safe. Legislators were largely muted in their criticism of that proactive, science-driven response. Ohio—the people and its politicians—felt united.

Then one day in mid-April, seventy-five protesters rallied outside the statehouse, protesting masks. Footage of them angrily banging on statehouse doors and windows quickly went viral. Several more protests followed. At most, they numbered in the low hundreds. But they, too, generated coverage across the state. “It made it seem like the whole state was anti-mask when really, only a few dozen people originally showed up,” Rachel told me. “And then it became the whole narrative.”

And once that became the narrative, the politics and policy at the legislature flipped. Legislators pushed back hard on the governor, with some even threatening to impeach him. The governor’s tone changed, as did the strictness of his policies. Soon, anti-vax, anti-mask hyper-ventilating predominated the statehouse conversation, and Ohio’s health director was protested—even threatened.

Ironically, a poll months after these protests showed that more than 60 percent of Ohioans _still_ supported a mask mandate in the state.[^67] But that small group of protesters flipped the overall narrative and shaped all that followed.

The lesson is clear. Advocacy by even a small group of people can set the overall narrative on critical issues. This presents huge opportunities to shape the narrative through advocacy at statehouses. But also presents huge risks if you leave that shaping to an extreme minority, which is too often what happens today.

**Fourth—**_“A lot of bills come from citizen ideas”_

In addition to stopping bad bills, citizen advocacy can generate and support positive legislation that lifts people and advances mainstream values. In Ohio, citizen advocates don’t have to write bills directly—they can call the legislative office, suggest the idea, and that office can then request that a bill be drafted up. Citizen suggestions become law more often than people would think.

**Fifth—**_“If you can’t stop the bad thing, you need to make them look bad while they’re doing the bad thing.”_

Rachel’s trainings prepared attendees for disappointment. Terrible bills _will_ pass despite loud voices speaking out against them. It happens far too often.

But even then, the advocacy work matters: “If you can’t stop the bad thing, you need to make them look bad while they’re doing the bad thing.”

Silence is their ally. It breeds the broader atmosphere of zero accountability and zero transparency. So even when extreme bills pass, loud opposition still makes a difference. In the state capital, and potentially back home. Even in defeat, advocates can shape the narrative.

**Sixth—“**_You Aren’t Alone”_

Advocacy through groups is uplifting for the advocates _themselves_. Especially if you feel outnumbered in a gerrymandered district, you realize that “you aren’t alone. There are thousands of people who agree with you.” And on so many issues, when you speak up at the statehouse, you are actually speaking _for the majority_ of your state against a loud but vocal minority. You are performing invaluable public service by providing that voice.

Tip 1 from Chapter 7 was that the majority needs to stop getting bullied into thinking it’s in the minority. Collective and public advocacy is a key part of doing this.

If you are part of a political group at any level, or an institution involved in public issues, public service and/or advocacy at any level, _add state legislative advocacy as an element of that work_.

“Every single issue that these organizations care about is being impacted at the statehouse,” Rachel cautions. But many still aren’t focused there.

Then keep up with that legislative activity: “Have at least one person in the group or organization monitoring statehouse committees. Have that person report back to their organization at regular meetings.”

Then advocate whenever necessary.

**Fighting Censorship and “Memory Laws”**

The path to save the nation is very simple. It’s going to go through school boards.[^68]

—Steve Bannon

The war on history is a war on democracy.[^69]

—Tim Snyder

Throughout 2021 and 2022, the Ohio Board of Education (a combination of appointees and members elected from districts) pushed one right-wing crusade after the next. Even with the national ranking of Ohio’s schools plummeting from fifth to the mid-twenties over a decade, far-right school board members dedicated meeting after meeting to culture war debates.

Then something interesting happened: the voters weighed in.

Two of the far-right board members faced reelection in November 2022, and a third seat was open. Three candidates—two former teachers themselves—ran for those seats promising to end the culture wars and get back to improving public education. And even though Ohio Republicans had a big night overall, all three of these Democratic-endorsed[^70] candidates flipped those seats. Those wins flipped control of the elected majority of the board in a way that blocks the right-wing nonsense going forward.

As surprising as they were, those victories followed a trend from a year before. In the Fall of 2021, a well-coordinated, well-funded effort emerged across Ohio to elect far right, anti-CRT, anti-vax candidates to school boards. It only became clear late in the cycle how robust this effort was, and I feared it would sweep candidates to victory everywhere. But despite enormous advantages, most of those candidates lost in Ohio—even in conservative areas. Similar outcomes have occurred in other states.

The bottom line: censorship, book-banning, and the politicization of curricula have emerged as the latest front in the attack on democracy. But what happened in Ohio shows that you can successfully fight back.

And we must.

**Censorship and “Memory Laws”: A Danger to Democracy**

As the experts on authoritarianism warn, censorship and authoritarianism go hand in hand.

To the extent the censors and book banners target an already marginalized group of citizens, that censorship is an extension of the broader attack on that group, often previewing far worse to come. Silencing a group’s voice accompanies eviscerating its rights in law. Banishing a group’s narrative erases its identity. Putin’s war against Ukrainians provides a horrific case study: long before physical invasion, the Russian government worked to erase independent Ukrainian identity from Russian history texts.

But censorship isn’t just about the group under attack—it’s about the group doing the attacking. It’s about “the feelings of the powerful that are to be protected,” scholar Tim Snyder writes.[^71]

And when those in power whitewash history of its darkest moments, they do far more damage than simply distorting the past. Patterns in history often repeat themselves. The same tools and tactics are used to attack democracy and rights over the generations. So cleansing history of its worst elements dangerously conceals those patterns and tactics even as they make their inevitable return. Which is why censorship of history is as much about the _present_ as the past. As Snyder says,

The new American memory laws have been passed by state legislatures that, in the same session, have passed laws designed to make voting more difficult. The memory management enables the voter suppression.[^72]

Scary.

And dangerous enough that we must battle both the suppression _and_ the censorship.

**Fighting Back**

All the strategies from previous chapters apply to this battle. Specifically:

1. Get To the Front Lines

The rise of censorship opens a new front line in the battle for democracy: school boards, library boards, and other institutions that make decisions about curriculum, content, and our collective memories. Just a single member can be the difference between banning Toni Morrison, Margaret Atwood, or Isabel Wilkerson because one parent or protest demands it, or allowing kids and families the freedom to choose for themselves what to read.

And make no mistake, the extremist right sees it this way. They know they can turn once under-the-radar, nonpartisan positions into battering rams for their “memory law” agenda. And just as with statehouses, secretaries of state, and elections officials, they are organizing to seize as much power on this new front as possible. National right-wing groups are recruiting, training, and providing technical assistance for school board candidates across the country—while other efforts encourage and guide “grassroots” movements against school boards.

That’s the bad news.

The good news is that the effort can be beaten back if _we_ engage on that front line as well. Because we too have advantages.

First, unlike statehouse races, these local races take place within the boundaries of school districts. Which means they’re _not in gerrymandered districts_ where outcomes are often preordained.

Second, these races are generally _nonpartisan_—party ID is not listed on the ballot. This creates opportunities for hard-working and dedicated candidates and coalitions to overcome partisan politics in their community.

Third, these races often take place in _odd years_, when turnout is lower. Which means well-organized turnout efforts can have a major impact on who wins.

Fourth, and most importantly, those who oppose banning books stand _on the side of the people_. As much as the far right may brainstorm, plan, and fund a book-banning agenda, that agenda (like most of their agenda) remains underwater with everyday Americans. Deep underwater.

One poll in Ohio from late 2022 made this clear:[^73]

•  Most Ohioans _trust teachers_ to teach students in an unbiased way (63.1 percent to 30.2 percent).

•  Most trust that Ohio’s current curriculum exposes students to _appropriate_ concepts and ideas (56.6 percent to 32.1 percent).

•  Most _disagree_ with the idea that parents should have direct control over which books are available in school libraries (40.2 percent agree—53.8 percent disagree).

•  Most _disagree_ with the idea that parents should be able to stop schools from teaching topics they don’t like (38 percent to 56.4 percent).

•  A supermajority supports teaching about the history (74.9 percent to 20.4 percent) and impact (75.3 percent to 20.6 percent) of _race and racism_ in the United States.

National polls show similar preferences.[^74]

It turns out, most people don’t want someone else’s parents or some outside group telling their own kids what _they_ can read, or what ideas they can consider. I sure as hell don’t. Like me, most trust teachers and schools and librarians to do the job, and they vote accordingly.

More broadly, for the same reason people don’t want extremists taking over secretary of state offices (to then advance an extremist agenda), they _really_ don’t want extremists taking over the school where they send their kids to learn every day. That’s an even more personal impact.

And of all the community institutions out there, few enjoy broader support than public libraries. I can’t remember seeing an attack on public libraries end well for the person or entity who waged the attack.

So the top goal in battling this new wave of censorship is to get to the front lines of that battle, where victories are just waiting to be won: state and local school boards, and positions that determine who leads public libraries.

_Value_ these races as central to the broader battle over democracy.

Leave no seats uncontested. Anywhere.

Leave no incumbent extremists unchallenged. Anywhere.

Take it as _your_ personal responsibility to fill these seats wherever you are. And if the candidate taking on that run is _not_ you, help him or her in any way you can.

2. Don’t Get Bullied—Advocate!

But don’t stop there. Because we have another lesson to learn from what happened in Ohio.

In the Fall of 2022, _before_ the surprising board of education elections, every board meeting was jam-packed with everyday Ohioans. So crowded, people had to sit on the floor or stand in an overflow room. For four straight months, up to one hundred Ohioans packed these meetings to testify against an anti-LGBTQ resolution that was before the board. Seeing the buzz of activity, both print and television media converged on the meetings, quoting many of the witnesses in their coverage. Continuous social media tracked the meetings as well.

Many of those testifying were part of a broad coalition called Honesty for Ohio Education. The group first emerged organically in response to bills in the Ohio Statehouse to eliminate the teaching of “divisive concepts” in Ohio schools. An initial e-mail chain grew into weekly Zoom meetings, then a website, and ultimately into a robust coalition and operation training and organizing advocacy on education issues.

While the coalition initially focused on the legislature, Cynthia Peeples—the group’s founding director—explained to me that they soon realized they had to go deeper: “Even if bills did not make it across the finish line at statehouses, we saw that these attacks were still happening at state education boards and local districts—at all of the different access points to public education.” So “we decided to trifurcate our efforts,” concentrating on local and state school boards.

Which, for the Ohio Board of Education, meant months of high-profile and packed meetings. Over time, a body most Ohioans previously knew nothing about was dogged by the (accurate) impression that all they were doing was fighting a right-wing culture war. And given that Ohioans wanted them to be doing the exact opposite, that narrative mattered. Which means the non-stop advocacy that shaped that narrative _really_ mattered.

Like the activists of Honesty for Ohio Education, we have to publicly push back against bans and “memory laws” wherever and whenever those decisions are being made.

Rachel’s tips from the prior chapter come in handy once again:

**First—**_“You are more POWERFUL than you think. . . . Your voice is a lot louder than you think it is at the legislature.”_

That’s even more the case at the local or state school board. Across the nation, parent- and student-driven efforts to stop book bans in schools are succeeding, including in conservative and rural areas.

It’s also the case with book publishers. In 2022, the Florida Freedom to Read Project came together to connect and support parent-led groups standing up against book-banning across the state. Freedom to Read discovered that one publisher—Studies Weekly—had modified its account of both Rosa Parks and Fred Korematsu (who challenged the Japanese internment policy during World War II). Specifically, the publisher had removed any reference to race or racism in its accounts, as if Rosa Park’s battle was a personal dispute over seat preferences(!).[^75]

Freedom to Read called out the changes, they were confirmed by the _New York Times_, and Studies Weekly reversed the change.

Bottom line: no one—schools or corporations, including publishers—should be caving to a book-banning agenda. Your loud voice can help ensure they don’t.

**Second—**_“They don’t like the attention. So bring it to them.”_

Even better, you don’t have to drive to the state capital to show up in person at a school or library board meeting. Neither does the local press—newspaper or TV.

Advocacy work can change outcomes, according to Peeples: “We did see, around several issues, even the extremists respond to public pressure.” Indeed, the two bills banning “divisive concepts” both ultimately died under the light and heat cast by Honesty for Ohio Education and other groups.

**Third—**_“If you don’t, someone else will”_

Remember Rachel’s story about the mask protest during the pandemic? The same thing is happening all over the country regarding book bans and censorship. We’ve all seen it: protests and angry testimony at school and library hearings, demanding that certain books be removed. The far right’s goal is to use loud voices to “bully” these bodies as the majority sit at home in silence. They want to create the false impression that they speak for the community. Too often, it works.

Don’t let it.

Don’t let your community—or your local school board—be bullied. If large numbers of residents show up—saying that “all children deserve the freedom to learn the truth of our past, and we trust teachers and ourselves to make these judgments”—_you_ are the ones speaking for the community. And you will straighten out that false narrative fast.

**Fourth—**_“If you can’t stop the bad thing, you need to make them look bad while they’re doing the bad thing.”_

Honesty for Ohio Education didn’t win every battle. That anti-LBGTQ resolution they opposed so fiercely ultimately passed in December 2022, although significantly watered down from the original version.

But the vociferous advocacy left a clear impression about the state’s school board across Ohio. Extremist. Distracted. Dysfunctional.

That negative frame was key in the surprising election results of November 2022.

**Fifth—“**_You aren’t alone”_

Cynthia Peeples explained that once Honesty for Ohio Education informed district residents about a right-wing effort to take over a local school board, many immediately stepped up, asking, “What can I do to help stop it?”

People are empowered when they realize they’re not alone.

3. Go on Messaging Offense.

As people run for these offices or advocate before them, go back to the experts’ words of wisdom from Chapter 7.

Start with values. Take the extremists’ position to its logical conclusion. Don’t ignore the dog whistle. Don’t get bullied. Name the villain:

“_You and your kids should have the freedom to make your own decisions about what they read and learn. And we trust teachers to help provide those choices. Some outside group or solo parent shouldn’t dictate that._”

“_All children should have the freedom to learn the truth of our past. [Candidate X] wants to divide us so that doesn’t happen, and then dictate that your child is only taught what they want.”_

Freedom. Parents. Kids. Trust teachers. Given where most Americans already stand on these values and issues, there are so many ways to message them effectively.

4. Use Your Whole Footprint

In 2022 and early 2023, no state more aggressively targeted schools and libraries for censorship than Florida. The governor opposed a new Advanced Placement course in African-American Studies until certain authors and topics were removed. And a combination of laws subjected millions of books to state review,[^76] while threatening teachers with criminal charges if the wrong books appear in their classroom libraries. Many emptied their shelves rather than risk prosecution.

What a nightmare.

Along came a Chicago publisher called Haymarket Books, announcing that it would provide free e-books on Black history in the very places where they’re being banned. Now that’s using your footprint to lift democracy and freedom.

The American Library Association, equally alarmed by book-banning around the nation, has dedicated its sizeable and respected footprint to fighting back as well. Just as it did back in the McCarthy era, the ALA has created a nationwide effort—United Against Book Bans—to help all Americans stand up to censorship. They provide a toolkit with message guidance, tips on how to best advocate with decision makers, guidance on organizing petition drives, and the like. (If you’re looking to put together an effort in your community, check out their website.[^77])

Good for the ALA. But so many more need to get in the game. We have to respond to every attempt to ban books and discourse with an immediate and forceful pushback. And never give an inch.

One example: the Florida bans initially swept up children’s books about baseball players and barrier breakers Roberto Clemente, Jackie Robinson, and Hank Aaron. Authors immediately spoke out. But so should Major League Baseball—its own Hall of Famers, caught in a broad net of censorship!

How could MLB use its footprint to battle back? Pass out copies of the banned books to kids as they arrive at baseball stadiums across Florida. Even if the books are reinstated, keep passing them out.

And what can you, as an individual, do about all this?

So much.

Start by diving into some of the very materials that you see being targeted (groups like the American Library Association track what books are being banned). Check out the books and writers that explore the history of our country that they are so eager to water down; read the novels that capture the gut-wrenching emotions of our darkest times and tell the stories of those who overcame them. Some of these books will change your life—they have mine. Then share the title and your thoughts with your network, on Facebook, in your book club, or wherever else.

As those polls from above show, most Americans want to understand our full history—not have it be kept from them. I’ve seen this myself. As I mentioned in Chapter 7, I often use videotaped whiteboards to teach lessons about democracy and America. And I quickly detected a trend: the whiteboards about the very parts of our history they are attempting to whitewash are _by far_ the most shared and viewed videos I make. My most-viewed video—a basic description of the history of white backlash following moments where Black Americans made progress—reached almost one million views.

Americans want to know our history. Stand up to anyone trying to deny them that.

**Joining Forces—Combining Footprints**

It is from numberless diverse acts of courage such as these that the belief that human history is thus shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.

—Robert Kennedy, 1966

I have aimed this book at the individual reader for a reason. Often, books on politics and democracy instruct leaders, institutions and the country writ large what they must do to save democracy. And there is so much.

But my worry is that those thirty-thousand- and even fifteen-thousand-foot suggestions leave everyday Americans feeling like there’s nothing _they_ can do to protect democracy. And that they must wait for a group or leader to come along to save the day.

The truth is the opposite—every single person can take steps to protect democracy immediately. More importantly, _unless_ millions of everyday Americans take those steps, the scale of the effort won’t be big enough.

_So I hope you begin that work as soon as you put this book down._

BUT. . . look closely at some of the best examples of successful work from prior chapters: Blue Ohio. The States Project. Markers for Democracy. How Things Work at the Statehouse. Honesty for Ohio Education.

**Teaming Up for Democracy**

The most effective efforts to lift democracy are the ones that empower individuals to play an activist role _while_ bringing people together. _If done right_, collective efforts scale things up exponentially, and put the work on much firmer footing for the long haul. And the _effect grows more powerful the more pro-democracy work takes place beyond the traditional work of campaigns and political parties_:

1. Combining “Footprints”

The most powerful effect of group efforts to lift democracy is that they bring together _all the footprint_s of those participating to the cause. But they only reach their full potential if they take advantage of those full, collective footprints.

Any group that’s working to lift democracy—be it a party precinct or ward club, a nonprofit or an informal group of activists—should start its work inventorying and leveraging its own footprint, and the footprint of every single member of the group. And those footprints go _far_ beyond asking for members’ money or time, which are the two things most people are asked to contribute today.

Take stock in every footprint. Leverage them all.

2. From Feeling Alone to Social Proof

This is tough work. In some places, folks feel outnumbered (even when they’re not) and overwhelmed. Many are understandably intimidated by the hostility of the other side. When people come together, as Rachel Coyle described, folks no longer feel isolated. That alone lifts morale. It’s energizing. Sustaining.

Along those lines, whatever group you form, come together monthly or weekly. Blue Ohio has a monthly virtual lunch, catching up on the latest issues at the statehouse and generating game plans for advocacy; we bring in guests from across Ohio—often candidates and legislators—to let the group know what’s happening and how they can be most helpful. A group of phenomenal women in Virginia host a Power Lunch every Friday, doing the same. Trust me, each lunch is a show! Various coalitions in New York, including both Giving Circles and Democracy Marker chapters, have regular meetings, catching up with candidates and other guests from across the country as they raise dollars and write postcards to support them. The States Project Giving Circles meet all the time, just like J.’s did. There’s so much power and energy and morale that’s lifted through these regular meetings. As Melissa Walker said above: “You’re doing it with your friends and your families and your neighbors. You’re learning together.”

And when participation grows large enough, across multiple groups and communities, the impact compounds even further—from simply “not being alone” to reaching the powerful and necessary “social proof” threshold described in Chapter 7. Recall Anat Shenker-Osorio’s lessons from above: that the most persuasive tool in our arsenal is social proof. That people do the thing they think people _like them_ do. That “nothing we can say is as persuasive as what people see other people doing.”

Non-stop and visible activity of one large group or multiple groups builds that social proof across entire communities: _people like me are playing an active role in saving democracy. So I better as well._

3. Permanent Infrastructure, Grounded _in_ the Community

One of the greatest benefits of forming groups of pro-democracy activity while also incorporating such work into groups already serving the community is that, together, they form infrastructure that’s permanent, not cyclical. And these efforts reach far deeper into communities, often reaching the very voters left unengaged by the traditional political process.

Brian Miller, the executive director of Nonprofit Vote, an organization that trains nonprofits on how they can lift voters and democracy, told me: “We cannot rely on political parties to do this, or candidates. They only have so much money and only so much time. They’re going to prioritize people who have a history of voting. If you’re a low propensity voter, you’re not going to be contacted.”

Ironically, this former party chair agrees. If we over-rely on campaigns and candidates to do this work, a whole lot of Americans will be left out, just as they are now. But “[n]onprofits have a fundamentally different mission,” Miller says. “They empower the communities in which they serve, and give voice to the communities they serve.”

Churches. Local nonprofits. Community-based institutions. Unions. When these groups engage community members, “someone _that they know l_ooks them in the eye and says, ‘your opinion matters.’ The person at the local food pantry. The person at housing clinic you attend.” That voice is more trusted, eliciting a more robust response.

![[f269-1.jpg]]

Studies confirm this. Community-based nonprofits doing registration work are more than twice as likely to engage low-income voters and voters of color, and 1.5 times as likely to reach young voters.[^78] First, because they’re on the ground and already serving those folks. Second, because they’re not using a narrow political screen to choose who they engage.

And while they play key roles, parties and campaigns grow and shrink amid campaign cycles. Which means if we leave most of this work to political operations, valuable time is lost. Continuity is lost. But once incorporated into their broader missions, community-based organizations and groups can do this work all the time, not just during campaigns. It also means these groups can plan and assess their efforts with the long game in mind.

4. Beyond “Swing” States

Another reason to ground pro-democracy work beyond political parties and campaigns is because that party/campaign infrastructure is inevitably shaped by the federal swing state frame of today’s politics. Which means that while that work will be robustly supported in states and districts considered swing-state priorities, it will too often be left barren in places that are not.

To wage pro-democracy efforts everywhere, it must start with groups of committed people grounded in their own communities everywhere.

**Scaling Up, Again: Coalitions**

Now, go one step further:

Build c_oalitions_ of groups and institutions. For democracy. In every community.

Community and regional leaders should do on an ongoing basis what many already do when the US Census effort comes around every decade. Counties and cities organize herculean communal efforts—often through committee structures, involving the very organizations I mention above—to ensure that their respective populations are fully and accurately counted. They focus especially on segments of the population who are hardest to reach. They do this for many reasons, including that an accurate population count ensures communities get the funding they are entitled to for services they provide.

![[f271-1.jpg]]

_If **funding** inspires a robust community-wide Census count effort every ten years, a fully inclusive **democracy** should serve as an equally compelling inspiration for an “all hands on deck” coalition for democracy._ Bring a wide range of governmental and community-serving organizations together, take stock in all their footprints, and agree upon roles they can all play to engage constituents and lift democracy. Meet regularly, measure outcomes and learn from one another. Always grow.

This is especially needed in states like Ohio, Texas, and others, where government officials at the state level are working hard to purge the very voters who live in these communities. The civic leaders of these targeted communities’ officials should feel an obligation—a duty—to _fight back_ on behalf of those they serve and represent. And if they combine forces to lift their constituents back into democracy, they will build one hell of a sustained, pro-democracy, pro-voter coalition that doesn’t exist today in most places.

**Political Parties—_Stepping Up Engagement_**

For all the reasons described above, democracy is on much firmer footing if the Democratic Party or campaigns aren’t doing the lion’s share of the work. The reality of political party operations and funding just leaves too many gaps, which become especially dangerous when one side is attacking democracy nationwide and all the time.

Yet Democratic Party structures at the local, state, and national level still have a critical role to play. In fact, there are some roles that _only_ they play, so they better do them well.

First, they are the only entities allowed to _directly coordinate_ with candidates for office. So if the goal is to run and elect officeholders who champion democracy both as candidates and once in service, that unique ability to coordinate is key. Which means a strong and effective party is key. Likewise, unlike nonprofit and governmental organizations, they also can _directly advocate_ for residents to vote for those candidates.

Second, parties have access to powerful _national and in-state tools_ that allow them to engage and organize a wide variety of _voters_ and communities. These tools may not reach the entire electorate, but who they _do_ reach is critically important. So they better do this well.

Third, well-run parties have a _sizeable infrastructure_ of dedicated members and volunteers, many who have institutional roles and responsibilities. This, in theory, allows them to mount _robust engagement_ and turnout efforts. More on that in a moment.

Fourth, the Democratic Party has a _political brand_, along with a robust messaging infrastructure. What the party and its candidates say and do motivate millions of people. Even the letter “D” on a ballot connotes something to every voter as they decide who to vote for. So that brand and messaging better be strong. (And that’s one other reason to run everywhere.)

These and other roles all underscore the critical functions parties can play at different levels. And on the positive side, the best-run parties do great work. In Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Georgia, and elsewhere, well-run parties have been instrumental in pro-democracy wins, while averting costly setbacks. These parties are mission-driven, robust, and professional operations that engage voters and lift candidates. They are transparent and led by outstanding leaders. They are well-funded, receiving support from across the country. At the heart of campaign cycles, they work with candidates up and down the ballot to build enormous get-out-the-vote efforts; and outside of those cycles, they don’t disappear.

On the flip side, in too many places, much of this critical party work is _not_ happening at the scale needed. In many places, it’s for the reasons summarized in Chapters 1 and 2—failure to see that we are in a battle for democracy that must be waged in every corner of all fifty states. The federal swing-state frame leaves too many parties in red states underfunded, understaffed—often run by a part-time chair and a single staff member—and far too small to do even the most basic work needed. And in states considered so blue that they’re “safe” for federal purposes, the same problem emerges at great cost—just look at New York’s disastrous underperformance in 2022. Some state or local parties remain under the thumb of a single political leader, operating the way parties operated generations ago, which too often undermines the mission of engaging voters and lifting democracy more broadly.

Big picture, the well-run state and local parties should serve as role models for all fifty states. And there should be more incentives and deeper funding support for parties beyond “swing states” to operate at that same high level. Some good organizations are working hard to make this happen.

Needless to say, a whole book could be written about this. . . and that is not this book.

But there is _one thing_ you can help parties do right away, wherever you are. . . .

**Engage Voters from Precincts/Wards Up**

There’s one aspect of political party work that may be the most overlooked in all of politics. Which means there’s a single shift that could bring life to every county party in every state in the nation. And that shift isn’t reliant on national forces and big dollars and grand, top-level plans to happen. In fact, back to the theme of this book, this is a shift _you_ can help make happen.

They go by different titles. In Cincinnati, we call them “precinct executives.” Elsewhere, they are called “committeemen” or “committeewomen.” In other places, “ward chairs.” Whatever they’re called, they are the basic unit of each city or county party structure in the country.

These are elected positions—or appointed by a county party if there is a vacancy. As members of the executive committee of the city or county party, these posts play a formal role in the operation of the party, in its endorsement process, and in the selection of its leadership. Often, that governing role is what drives folks to run for these roles, or why they’re recruited to do so.

But here’s the thing. . . each precinct executive (to use the term where I live) also, formally, represents a specific voting district of their community. _That_ precinct or ward—a handful of specific, contiguous blocks of a community—comprises the most basic building block of the entire nation’s political geography. Fortunately, these precincts usually include hundreds of voters—a manageable number. In cities, highly concentrated—which means walkable. In rural areas, more spread out—but still drivable. All callable.

![[f276-1.jpg]]

Now, amid all the postcards and digital messages and fancy TV ads aimed at voters, do you know what single change would forever lift turnout and alter outcomes in American elections more than any other?

Simple: _if every Democratic precinct executive or committeeman or committeewoman in this country **took ownership** of the precinct she or he is elected to represent_. If they all made the simple decision to engage and organize the manageable number of residents living in those small geographic regions.

It’s that straightforward.

But, in my experience, almost none do this. Precinct executives dutifully go to meetings and pitch in in other ways, but only a tiny percentage actually work their precincts. Even worse, many precinct and ward positions sit vacant. Add it up, and the lack of engagement at the precinct level marks the single most wasted voter engagement opportunity in American politics.

Why don’t precinct executives take ownership of their precincts?

In many cases, it’s because no one ever asks them to. No one ever sets that basic expectation, or gives them a _job description_ of what the role _they ran for_ means, or could mean if they did it well. No one lays out even the most basic tasks that could make such a difference in the role they chose to occupy.

Tasks as simple as:

1.  recruit a street captain for every street of your precinct, who then takes ownership of that street.

2.  recruit an apartment building captain for every building of your precinct.

3.  engage every public-serving business in your precinct, and get them in the game if they’re interested—(i.e., do what Vashitta did).

4.  task every one of those captains to engage and get to know the voters on their street or in their building—long before actual elections—and whenever new folks move in.

5.  bring residents together on a regular basis, both captains and anyone from the precinct who is interested; or send them regular emails.

6.  do a sweep of the community months before each election to ensure folks are registered.

7.  do the same for early voter opportunities.

8.  do the same for election day voting.

Or go even bigger: create a standing precinct organization—ten, thirty, fifty members—that comes together regularly, then uses the footprints of all its members as the basis of broader work. With that group, build a long-term plan for the precinct.

![[f278-1.jpg]]

One of the greatest benefits of robust precinct organizing is that it, like community-based organizations, fills gaps otherwise left by political operations. First, it engages people far earlier than last-minute knocks on doors; those late knocks are no longer stand-alone transactional moments, but the last of a steady series of engagements. Second, the conversations are more authentic, led by a neighbor—not a stranger. And third, the precinct strategy can target _all_ voters, with extra focus on disengaged and suppressed voters, as opposed to the far narrower approach of most campaigns.

Doesn’t this all sound pretty straightforward? Common sense? What a political outsider would assume is already happening?

In my experience, almost _none_ of this happens _anywhere!_

Which is why I say, again—if every single Democratic precinct executive _took ownership_ of her precinct, doing this work, outcomes would change. Heck, if 50 percent of Democratic precinct executives did so, outcomes would change. Thirty percent, still a big change.

What does it take to make this happen?

It takes people _deciding to do it_—deciding that our democracy matters enough to make these critical roles about engaging the community, and not just going to insider meetings. And it takes leaders asking them to do it—setting that new expectation that _you own your precinct._

Once party organizations and individuals have decided to take that ownership, then do the following:

1.  write up a basic job description for the precinct executive role;

2.  share it with every new precinct executive as soon as they’re elected—set the expectation from the outset;

3.  organize early training for precinct executives on how to do the described job;

4.  have the broader city or county organization establish goals and deadlines for what each precinct should achieve by when;

5.  do the work;

6.  do it so broadly and actively that you build the social proof that _this is what you do_ if you are a precinct executive. This is the new expectation—the new normal; and

7.  build a long-term plan.

So wherever you live, know that you’re sitting on the greatest untapped opportunity to change outcomes in American politics:

1.  If you’re a precinct captain, _own_ your precinct. That is _one hell_ of a footprint.

2.  If you’re not involved in the party, but you’re a registered Democrat and you’re sitting in a precinct that’s vacant, run for it next time and do this work. See if you can get appointed to it in the meantime.

3.  Whether you’re involved in the party or not, if the precinct you live in is not being organized by anyone, figure out who the precinct executive is, track them down, see what they’re doing, and offer to do the organizing work that needs to be done. Of course, build a _long-game_ plan for the precinct.

![[f281-1.jpg]]

Whatever you do, start the conversation and work to make this happen. Wake up this dormant infrastructure.

Can this really work, you may be asking? Yes it (we) can! It’s exactly what the early Obama campaign did when people organized house parties in communities across the country; they didn’t see active precinct organizing where they were, so they did it themselves. That model drove one of the most historic campaigns our nation has ever seen.

This is the lowest hanging fruit out there to save democracy.

Let’s care enough to grab it.

Memo to Corporate America: What happened to Disney is the future. Your future. So don’t be next.

And what happened to Disney?

The company invested dollars into extremist Florida legislators; in 2022, those legislators passed an extreme bill (which became known as the “Don’t Say Gay” law); Disney constituents (employees and customers) spoke out against the company for supporting those politicians; Disney spoke out against the bill and suspended political contributions; and then the politicians turned around and punished Disney for having spoken out. And the firestorm has never ebbed. (Those same politicians now want to dictate Disney content, and Disney—to its credit—is now fighting back.)

In _Frozen_, the snowman Olaf famously said_:_ “Some people are worth melting for.” But those Florida extremist legislators definitely were _not_ among them. It’s a lesson that all of corporate America needs to learn, and fast.

Investing in statehouses that have become Laboratories of Autocracy is a horrible investment. Especially for companies with a broad-based customer or employee base—one that reflects the diversity and mainstream views of our nation—your investment will lead to laws and politics that attack your own constituents directly, while offending many more. And that means _your support_ of those extremists will also ultimately offend them. Nothing you say to defend your investment will suffice. And when you try to walk it back, you’ll be attacked by the extremists you helped empower.

What’s the solution for companies like Disney?

Get out of the autocracy business! The sooner, the better.

Instead, put your money where democracy is.

We all should. And we can all make that happen.

**Autocracy is Bad for Business**

Disney’s opening move in the Florida saga—contributing to extremist legislators—is standard operating procedure for too many American businesses. Of course, they don’t see it as investing in autocracy. It’s government relations 101—contributing to incumbent politicians who can help them when they want something. They’re banking on that relationship coming in handy, session after session. And the way these places work, they’re right to think that.

But given the decrepit state of these legislatures, investing in autocracy is exactly what they’re doing. Their dollars are propping up extremists in state after state, which means they are funding attacks on democracy as well as a downward spiral into extremism. And at some point, the systems they are helping build will come back to haunt _them._

Here in Ohio, the pattern plays out time and again. Just a few examples:

After _Dobbs_, Ohio corporate behemoths like Procter & Gamble and Kroger announced that they will fly their employees to other states for abortion care. These are two of the most high-profile members of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. Where did the Ohio Chamber and other business groups invest millions in the Fall of 2022, _after_ these company announcements? To support candidates for the Ohio Supreme Court who, in surveys, all said those women employees had no Constitutional right to privacy. These three GOP candidates also voted to uphold gerrymandered maps that will lock in anti-abortion extremism in Ohio.

And thanks in part to the Chamber’s efforts, all three of those candidates won. That’s right—the Ohio Chamber spent millions to elect candidates who will force its own members to fly workers out of state for abortion access going forward. Make that make sense—you can’t.

Another example: after the anti-vax bug swept through Ohio’s statehouse, the Ohio Chamber had to undertake a feverish lobbying effort to stop a bill that would’ve prevented private businesses from requiring vaccinations—not just for COVID, but _any_ vaccinations. That’s right, their top lobbying priority was to stop the statehouse they prop up from banning vaccine requirements in their own workplaces.

More broadly, leaders of most Ohio companies consistently say that “workforce” is their largest challenge. It’s a never-ending struggle to find educated and skilled workers for the future, either who are raised in Ohio and stay here, or that they can attract to Ohio from elsewhere. And do you know where so much of these companies’ political dollars go? Into the pockets of politicians who are making that workforce challenge that much worse by 1) tanking the quality of Ohio’s public schools and 2) driving future generations of Ohio to other states because of far-right culture wars those generations are repelled by.

These are just a few examples of a big picture truth: a healthy democracy is good for business, and a subverted democracy harms business. As the pro-democracy business group, Leadership Now, argued in a Supreme Court brief in the _Moore v. Harper_ case: “a system of government that incorporates strong adherence to the rule of law, a system of checks and balances, and elections that reflect the will of the voters, is highly correlated with a thriving economy.”[^79]

So how do we get businesses and business groups at all levels to see that investing in autocracy is not just bad for the country, its states, and its people. . . but bad for business itself?

As with everything else in this book, it starts with you.

**Our Democracy Budget: Putting Our Money Where Democracy Is**

There are few more influential parts of our footprints than where we spend our dollars. As contributions to causes, as daily spending, or as longer-term investments. And our collective decisions on how we expend those dollars can make an enormous difference in lifting democracy.

For those who already dedicate some of your hard-earned money to political causes (ie. candidates, parties, etc.), my hope is that once you see that we’re in a battle for democracy itself, you’ll convert your political spending into a _“democracy budget.”_ (For others who haven’t given before, start your “democracy budget” from scratch).

Once you frame it that way, you’ll see that beyond simply giving to federal “swing” candidates every two years, there are numerous other ways to invest dollars as part of a more strategic long game that lifts democracy. So, think through that budget as you would any other. Beyond traditional federal candidate giving (which still matters), consider a mix of options that lift democracy over a longer time-frame (I’ve mentioned many in prior chapters), and budget accordingly. And yes, many of these also are tax-deductible contributions, so your dollars go further. When you make this shift, also know that a broadening of investment in these directions also shifts the incentive structure of Team D’s political players to adopt a broader pro-democracy approach. (Ie. if there’s only money flowing into swing-state federal races, that’s where most of those working on Team D will inevitably focus).

![[f290-1.jpg]]

But beyond the money we intentionally spend on politics, we also need to take a look at all the other money we spend on a daily basis. Because in ways we don’t appreciate, the money we spend as consumers flows downstream into politics far more than even our direct political giving does—three times more, the organization Goods Unite Us estimates.[^80]

So every day, we face a simple choice. We can spend and invest our dollars to lift democracy, or we can spend in a way that funnels dollars into the drive toward autocracy and extremism.

![[f291-1.jpg]]

Each of us, in any way we can, should _maximize our pro-democracy spending and minimize our extremism spending_. Let’s reward those institutions who are doing the right things by democracy; and let’s keep our money out of places that are propping up autocracy and extremism (because that means _our money_ is also propping up extremism). By doing this, as well as communicating those decisions, we can create a broader incentive structure to support democracy. In case this sounds quaint or theoretical, the Disney example shows just how powerful that incentive system can be.

How do we do this?

First, individually, we do it little by little, every day. Goods Unite Us analyzes where various companies spend their political dollars—which they derive from _your_ dollars. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has tracked which companies gave to politicians who refused to certify the 2020 election, after many had promised not to. Other organizations like Color of Change bring similar transparency, highlighting corporate spending that contributes to extremism and racial discrimination. Some journalists, like Judd Legum, do the same. So take a look at these and other resources (listed at the end of this chapter) as you spend. See if your spending aligns with your political views, and democracy. Adjust accordingly.

As you spend dollars at the local level, remember Vashitta’s work to enlist restaurants to become “voter hubs.” Every time she’d tell me about a new hub doing pro-democracy work, I’d tweet out “thank you,” name the restaurant, and encourage people to frequent that business, eat their great food, _and_ get registered. Do the same thing however you can. Whether it’s a salon like Kim Thomas’s or one of those restaurants, or far bigger enterprises, patronize businesses that are doing the right thing by democracy. Thank them when you do it. For small businesses, in particular, if playing an active role in lifting democracy adds to their customer base, it gives them one more reason to do it. It’s not just good for their customers, but good for business.

On the other hand, if you see that a business you frequent is propping up extremists, take your business elsewhere. And make it clear why you chose to do so. You don’t need your hard-earned dollars boosting extremism, especially when that undermines the other work you do to lift democracy.

Or if you’re asked to give to a nonprofit, ask them if they use their footprint to lift democracy or register those they serve. If they don’t, ask them why not. Encourage them to do it, and say you prefer to give to institutions that also lift democracy. That that’s part of your core mission. Help them see that it should be part of theirs too.

Or if you understand that the dying local media is a major factor in allowing these statehouses to become hotbeds of extremism, invest a few dollars in subscribing to the local paper. Nonprofit journalism is also emerging as a viable alternative in many states—like the _Texas Tribune_ or the _Ohio Capital Journa_l. Nonprofit reporters are bringing sunshine and accountability to statehouses that otherwise would have neither. Put your money where democracy is by supporting these vital institutions. We don’t want them just to tread water—we need them to grow far more robust as traditional newspapers disappear or get gobbled up.

Wherever you can, tie how you spend your dollars to democracy. You don’t need to change everything you do. But each time you spend, ask yourself—are you lifting democracy, or untintentionally investing in its demise?

If saving democracy is part of your core mission, this is a natural extension of that. On the other hand, it makes no sense to spend dollars in a way that undermines all your other pro-democracy work.

If we all do this, it adds up.

**Then Scale It Up**

Now lift that approach one level higher.

If you’re in a political group, and you take up Rachel Coyle’s advice to include a state legislative focus, add the following project to your list. Take a close look at which corporations, trade groups, and other associations prop up your state’s extremists through their dollars or endorsements. You’ll likely be stunned by what you find.

One of the most egregious examples I cite in _Laboratories of Autocracy_ involves a legislator from Greater Cincinnati named John Becker. This guy comes out of extremist central casting. He wanted to impeach the governor for his science-driven response to COVID; pushed a bill mandating a physiologically impossible surgery to “correct” life-threatening ectopic pregnancies; wrote that Ohio should withdraw from the United States; and opined that the 14th Amendment should not be recognized. And so much more.

Batsh!t crazy stuff, right? A true extremist.

Well, over his four terms, Becker was endorsed by the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, the Ohio Society of CPAs, the Cincinnati Area Board of Realtors, and was honored as a “Friend of Agriculture” by the Ohio Farm Bureau. So, in layman’s terms, we have everyday accountants, businesses, farmers, and realtors all propping up an extremist. Even the Ohio State Medical Association endorsed him—a guy trying to force doctors to perform an impossible surgery on Ohio women whose lives are in danger!

As Disney did, these groups consider endorsing extremists like Becker to be business as usual. But _we_ need to call it out for what it is—unacceptable! And just as Disney did, every one of them should hear loudly that mainstream Ohioans will no longer let it continue without pushback. Your advocacy group should make all that highly public and crystal clear.

Even better, each group should hear from its own members about it. The Chamber should hear from its business members, which means employees and customers should say something to those members. The Realtors should hear from realtors. The Farm Bureau should hear from farmers. The CPAs should hear from accountants. And the Medical Association should hear from doctors, nurses, and others in healthcare. And any businesses that support the likes of Becker should hear from customers, clients, depositors, shareholders, and employees that their support for an extremist is seen and not appreciated.

This all means that you should look into the footprints of every member of your advocacy group to see how each might carry that message through as many of these influential channels as possible.

Even a small amount of noise can change outcomes. The protests against Disney were not all that big, as the number of employees who “walked out” in protest was in the hundreds. But their action drew enough unwanted attention to spur Disney leadership to reverse its indefensible support of extremists. Your group can have the same effect, especially if you use your collective footprints.

We need to create a new normal: no more supporting anti-democracy extremists. No more investing in autocracy. And make clear that customers, workers, and constituents are watching, acting, and spending their dollars accordingly.

Help make that happen in your individual decisions, and help make that happen as part of the groups you’re in.

**What Does “Putting Your Money Where Democracy Is” Look Like for Business?**

So as we encourage organizations and businesses to stop investing in extremism, and invest in democracy instead, what are we suggesting they do?

There are so many options that could make such a difference.

First, businesses can and should invest in efforts, reforms, and initiatives that lift democracy. Above, I cited a brief by an organization called **Leadership Now**. This is a national coalition of businesses and business leaders who are alarmed about the decline of America’s democracy. And they are advancing a wide variety of initiatives and reforms to help change that trajectory.

For example, they have created a “Democracy Report Card” for states, measuring the strength of democracy in American states in the same way that businesses conduct risk analyses before doing business in foreign countries.[^81] Not only does this raise business awareness about the decline of democracy and growing business instability in states, but it creates an economic incentive within states (and among the business communities of these states) to get their act together when it comes to democracy and the rule of law.

Leadership Now also provides guidance on how corporate lobbying and political giving can better align with the deeper values a company espouses, or its ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals. And they encourage businesses to apply their lobbying muscle in states (and Washington) _for_ democracy, and not just more narrow corporate interests. For example, American Airlines loudly opposed a Texas voter suppression bill, and its opposition helped water down the worst of that bill. When companies large and small speak out against such laws, in unison and on a regular basis, it makes an enormous difference. On the other hand, when legislators suppress votes and gerrymander districts to empower extremists, silence by business signals that they don’t care—or worse, that they support it—even when their own workers and customers are the ones being attacked. That silence is no longer acceptable.

Leadership Now also guides state chapters of business leaders on reforms—nonpartisan primaries, independent districting commissions, and the like—that can brake the downward spiral away from democracy. Active business support of these types of nonpartisan reforms would make an enormous difference in making them happen.

But as with individuals and groups, the most powerful step businesses can take to lift democracy—and what we should be looking for them to do as we make our own spending decisions—is _using their own footprints to advance the cause_.

Like Leadership Now, a group called **Civic Alliance** helps companies do just that. What are the types of things both groups encourage companies to do?

**First**, create a _voter friendly workplace_. First, by encouraging their own workers to vote by communicating information about upcoming elections, how to register, and the like. Even better, by taking meaningful steps such as paid time off (Gap Inc. and Pinterest), opening late or closing early (Best Buy), giving “voting time off” (Etsy), etc., to make voting as easy as possible for their workforce. All this sends a signal to their employees, customers, and constituents that voting is so important, they’re willing to invest in it. It communicates that part of their _mission_ is that their own employees take part in democracy.

**Second**, encourage their own workers or other constituents to serve as _poll workers_ or in the other posts described in Chapter 6. Many already do so. Old Navy and Target, for example, paid their employees to serve as poll workers, while LinkedIn recruited both its employees and members to do the same, focusing on areas where poll workers were in high demand. Similarly, the NFL partnered with veterans organizations to encourage thousands of veterans to volunteer as poll workers in the 2022 midterms.

**Third**, encourage _consumers and customers to register, vote, and be engaged in other ways_, again using their full footprint to do so. Like the McDonald’s, NFL, and Kroger examples from Chapter 3, there are countless ways that companies can encourage, inspire, and directly help their customers participate in democracy. Some of my favorite examples:

•  **Lyft** offered 50 percent off rides to polls and drop boxes in 2020;

•  **Zillow** created a service where renters moving into a new apartment are prompted to update their voter registration;

•  **Under Armour** started a “Run to Vote” campaign, partnering with local community organizations to communicate the importance of voting, and using its retail outlets and website to provide customers with information on how to vote; and

•  In some states, companies lend high-profile locations to serve as voting sites—in 2020, for example, forty thousand Georgians voted early inside the **Atlanta Hawks**’ State Farm Arena, making it the largest-ever voting precinct in Georgia history.

These are just a few examples of a growing movement of companies using their footprints to lift democracy. Goods Unite Us provides a long list of companies they call “Democracy Defenders” who do this in creative and powerful ways. Take a look at them, then spend a few minutes brainstorming other possibilities, and you quickly see _how much more_ can be done:

1.  Take the **Vot-ER** model from Chapter 4, where ER doctors use a QR code on their badges to help patients register. . . and expand it to all sorts of popular products. Let’s say—a message on every package of Pampers: “Vote for your kids’ futures; check your registration here,” with a QR code next to it. Sky’s the limit here!

2.  Take the **NFL** example, running ads about voting during games that include a QR code linking fans to voter registration information. . . and expand it to all sorts of other content. How? Civic Alliance provides a toolkit on how media companies and content creators can incorporate voting and civic participation into media content they are already putting out in the world.

3.  Take the **McDonald’s** example, a voter registration form on every tray. . . and get a wide variety of restaurants to do the same thing. National chains. Local mom-and-pops. You name it. And no need to stop at restaurants—all retailers could do what **Kroger** and **Under Armour** did in 2020.

At the local and regional level, build business coalitions to do this activity together. Local businesses and business groups should band together with other community efforts (from the prior chapter), all using their footprints to lift democracy and voters in the community they serve.

Get out of the autocracy business. Put your money where democracy is.

Do it yourself in your day-to-day spending. And if you work for a business large or small, advocate for ways that it can do the same. You’ll be part of an ever-growing movement.

Harness the power of groups to create incentives to invest in democracy. Make it clear that you’re watching and rewarding the businesses and business groups that are doing so.

If enough of us do it, we build the _social proof_ that almost everyone’s doing it. Of course, certain companies will still invest in the extremists. But let’s set a goal that they become the rare exception and not the norm. Let the MyPillows of the world be the only ones left in the autocracy business.

Make lifting democracy the norm.

**The Big Stuff**

[W]ithout the voices from afar, there would’ve been no chorus of liberty.[^82]

—Jon Meachem

In _Laboratories of Autocracy_, I review a number of the big-picture actions and reforms that national, state, and local leaders _must_ pursue to successfully protect democracy.

They include:

**Federal Legislation to Protect Democracy**

The single most powerful guardian of democracy and voting rights is the federal government. The authors of the US Constitution and its Amendments gave Congress explicit power to play that role, and when Congress has done so, America’s democracy reached its highest points. Those authors would expect federal leaders to exercise that power again now.

At the next opportunity (I had hoped for 2021-22, but now our goal must be for after 2024), Democrats in the House and Senate _must pass_ both robust _voter protections_ and _prohibitions on partisan gerrymandering_ nationwide. The Supreme Court’s rulings gutting the Voting Rights Act require a strong Congressional response. And the Constitution’s Guarantee Clause makes clear that protecting democratic governance in states is a sworn constitutional duty of every federal official—and not something the filibuster can legitimately block.

The federal government also shoulders an obligation to protect core rights—such as a woman’s right to choose, and union organizing—that are now under attack in states and in the courts.

**A Political Infrastructure that Values Running Everywhere**

National Democratic leaders must broaden and deepen the party’s political infrastructure to do the pro-democracy work I call for in this book—engage everywhere, run everywhere, hold extremists accountable everywhere. We have to get beyond the federal, swing-state, two-year cycle mindset. We have to get on offense _for_ democracy, and match what the other side is doing at all levels, all the time. That starts with a nationwide and state-level infrastructure designed and funded to do so.

**Accountability**

Those who have the opportunity to hold political lawbreakers accountable must do so far more aggressively than we’ve seen in recent years—from the Department of Justice enforcing federal law to state attorneys general, county, and city prosecutors enforcing state and local laws.

In many red states, where attorneys general and even some courts are part of the same extremist movement as the others in state government, self-policing is gone. So those who can step into the breach and uphold the rule of law must do so whenever possible.

From the feds to local prosecutors, judges, and justices, to professional organizations such as state bar associations, many are still too gun-shy about bringing needed accountability. Their passivity normalizes the lawbreaking and invites more lawlessness.

**Turn Blue States into Laboratories of Democracy**

Whenever those who support democracy control the levers of power in a state, they must operate as a laboratory of _democracy_—protecting rights that are under attack and passing pro-voter laws that enhance democracy. There should not be a blue state in America without automatic voter registration, same-day registration, an extended voting period, no-fault vote by mail, and similar reforms.

New Democratic majorities in Michigan and Minnesota took steps such as these shortly after they took over in 2023, sealing their states off from future attacks while establishing best practices for the nation. Virginia did the same under Governor Ralph Northam. As the New York 2022 election results made clear, failure to enact pro-voter best practices when we have the chance does damage both within states and beyond.

**Go Right to the People**

The 2022 abortion referendum in Kansas shows that rigged and extremist legislatures are way out of step with their voters. Michigan’s success in ending partisan gerrymandering via a statewide ballot initiative shows that the people want to end the practice of politicians picking their voters. Ballot initiatives on substantive issues like lifting the minimum wage and expanding Medicaid also have fared well across the country.

Bottom line: In states that allow it, going directly to the people on democracy reforms—such as independent districting commissions, nonpartisan primaries, and ranked choice voting—and the protection of core rights and economic security, offers the best hope for meaningful change. And each victory builds momentum for future progress.

**End _Citizens United_**

The flood of corporate dollars flowing into elections at all levels—often hidden in a maze of dark-money groups—creates a huge imbalance between those attacking democracy and those fighting for it. In many states, these dollars emerge from the corruption itself—rewarding politicians (or dark money groups that support them) with a portion of the public funds they are giving away to those corporations. It’s a sickening cycle: the corruption ends up paying to build the political firewall that keeps the politicians securely in place, who then transfer even more public funds to the private.

The dark money system also opens the floodgates for foreign money to flow into American politics. Autocratic governments elsewhere would like nothing more than to undermine American democracy, and our weak campaign finance system is the Trojan horse that gives them an easy entree. This risk will only grow with time.

Robust campaign finance reform is desperately needed to protect American democracy.

**The Media and Disinformation**

While Americans generally have to pay dollars to access the truth, they are inundated daily with _free_ disinformation. It’s a dangerous mismatch we must confront.

More deeply, the struggles of traditional media to stay afloat, combined with the rise of right-wing propaganda and disinformation disguised as media, pose a threat to democracy long-term. Propaganda echo chambers have played a key role in the decline of democracies in countries as Hungary.

Government and private sector leaders must effectively grapple with these challenges.

**Taking on Monopolies and Oligopolies**

The accumulation of monopoly and oligopoly power over so many sectors of American industry, combined with the use of dark money and media, only further undermines American governance. As FDR said, “The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself.”[^83]

Federal leaders must apply far more stringent anti-trust standards to traditional and new economic players—not just for economic reasons, but to protect democracy itself.

* * *

As we eye the long battle to secure democracy, these are just some of the larger institutional reforms and actions that federal and state leaders must undertake. Many volumes are dedicated to these and other suggestions.

But there’s a reason we’ve been talking about these potential reforms for a generation with hardly any progress. They’re big, and they’re difficult. They face massive resistance in a political system designed to stop big picture reform in its tracks. Sometimes, as we saw in 2021-2022, even some Democratic leaders don’t fight for big-picture change as hard as they should.

Which is where the action items in this book come in.

First, the main thrust of this book is that _we can’t wait_. The rest of us—those _not_ in national, state, or elected or appointed office with the power to take these steps—can’t simply wait for such leaders to do the big things we need them to do. Whatever they do, and whenever they do it, there is so much _we_ can and must do in the meantime to lift democracy. So, no more staring at national leaders as they contemplate solutions from above that come far too slowly, if ever—we must champion solutions from the ground up all that time.

Second, as we do _our_ work on the ground, _we still must push for those big changes_. We have to make clear to national and state leaders that this is not the time for politics as usual. That we and _they_ are in a battle for democracy itself. That this is the fight they’ve signed up for by seeking office at this fraught time. And that we _expect_ them to see that, and to fight that battle just as we are.

Which means your activist advocacy is essential _even with_ leaders with whom you generally agree.

As historian Jon Meacham explains in his podcast “It Was Said,” of course it took members of Congress and Presidents to enact big changes like the Voting Rights Act. But the _only reason_ those and other historic reforms made their way to the President’s desk is because Rhoda Denison Bement and John Lewis and millions whose names we don’t know willed that progress through decades of struggle and sacrifice:

[W]ithout the voices from afar, there would have been no chorus of liberty. The reformers’ work of resistance—long, hard, almost unimaginably difficult work—led to progress, and a broader understanding of who was included in the phrase, “We the People.”[^84]

It’s therefore on us to undertake that “long, hard” “reformers’ work of resistance.” The first eleven chapters of this book provide the strategies and tools to push loudly for these reforms now.

Just a few examples:

**Protecting Democracy through Federal Legislation**

Take the democracy coalition or advocacy group you have built in your community and use it to engage your United States Senator or House member. Let them know that you _expect_ them to fight for voting rights and anti-gerrymandering protections as the _first thing they do_ if we succeed in taking back the House and maintaining the Senate in 2024.

If these leaders are Democrats, make it clear that you want them to fight as hard for those reforms as State Senator Wendy Davis fought in Texas, when she spoke for hours on end to stop an attack on abortion access. Make clear that you want to see a meta-message from every Democratic Senator and House member that reflects the urgency of the moment. That you expect them to make a robust argument that the filibuster has no place blocking legislation that protects democracy itself. That they should make that argument day and night if they must. You want to see, from them, the “fire” that Frederick Douglass called for, and that patriots like the “Tennessee Three” and Mallory McMorrow unleashed when it was necessary.

Protecting democracy must come first. They must fight for it, on everything from voting rights to gerrymandering to campaign finance reform.

**An Infrastructure that Values Running Everywhere**

Do the same thing when it comes to pushing state and national parties to broaden their infrastructure so we value running everywhere. Demand it.

But beyond demanding it, if you’ve already done much of the legwork by building it from the ground up, you’ve already constructed the foundation of what you’re asking for: the awareness, the support, the connective tissue. You’ve made it far easier for national and state leaders to extend that infrastructure from the top down as well.

**Accountability**

If you are asked to support a county or local prosecutor candidate, make clear that you expect them to use that office not just for business as usual, but to hold political lawbreakers accountable at all levels. Communicate that same expectation to sitting officeholders.

This is not a stretch. Much of the lawlessness occurring in politics violates state or local laws. Actions such as intimidating voters, various forms of corruption, and the like.

Here’s one example: Did you know that it’s a felony in most states to interfere with the delivery of ballots sent by mail? Where were local prosecutors—_Democratic_ prosecutors—when it came to investigating the actions of Postal Service leaders in 2020, who dramatically slowed down the mail, amid a pandemic, at the very time that Americans were casting votes by mail? At a time when Donald Trump was attacking vote-by-mail in daily speeches? These actions warranted investigations of potential state felonies.

Let local prosecutors know that you expect them to look into crimes such as these that threaten the health of democracy itself. That you don’t expect business as usual.

Say it loudly.

**Turn Blue States into Laboratories of Democracy**

If you’re in a state where Democrats control the levers of power, use your collective voices to demand loudly and clearly that your state become a laboratory of democracy on pro-voter reforms. Do all the things Rachel Coyle suggested, but do it on behalf of pro-voter and pro-democracy legislation.

If your local governments aren’t doing all they can to lift democracy, advocate for that to happen as well.

Fight for it.

**Go Right to the People**

So many of the successful ballot initiatives in recent years emerged from broad grassroots efforts to lift democracy. That’s how much of the progress in Michigan was forged—from the bottom-up, not the top-down. Grassroots and good government groups successfully led the effort to twice amend Ohio’s Constitution to curb partisan gerrymandering, and those initiatives each earned more than 70 percent of the vote (only to be violated later by lawless legislators).

Bottom line: John Meacham’s right. Our history is instructive. Almost all of the big picture and institutional reforms we need in this country will only happen when a wide and loud “chorus of liberty” demands them from the bottom up.

However you can, join that chorus.

**THE BIG STUFF: RESOURCES**

In early 2023, a group of local and state leaders called the **New Deal Forum** developed a “Democracy Playbook,” outlining numerous recommendations that all Blue States should take up: [https://newdealforum.org/policy-groups/democracy/democracy-playbook](https://newdealforum.org/policy-groups/democracy/democracy-playbook\)

**“What Are You Going to Do?”**

In the summer of 1955, in the hills of Eastern Tennessee, Rosa Parks attended a workshop on how to forge social change from the ground up.

At the end of each training session, the trainer asked those in attendance the same question:

“What are you _going_ to do?”[^85]

Six months later, back in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks delivered her response—in words (“I don’t think I should have to stand up”) and in action (refusing to stand up).

Her reply changed the nation.

_“What are you going to do?”_ It’s as simple as a question gets. But your answer can change the world.

“What are you going to do?”

Vashitta Johnson answered by enlisting restaurants to become “voter hubs” all over Central Ohio.

Ebony DeLoach answered by enlisting three generations of her family to engage their entire network to register and vote in the next election.

Meg Overman answered by running as a write-in candidate in a gerrymandered district.

Rachel Coyle answered by teaching thousands of Ohioans how to advocate at the Statehouse, stopping some really bad bills in the process.

J. Smith Cameron answered by joining an immense national effort that struck an enormous blow for democracy in 2022.

So, go ahead and ask yourself. . . what are _you_ going to do?

Knowing that we are in a battle for democracy itself. . . what are _you_ going to do?

Knowing that that battle is taking place in every corner of this country, including right where you live. . .

Knowing that that battle must be fought continuously, and not only amid the ups and downs of federal campaign cycles. . .

Knowing that the core strategy in the battle _against_ democracy is to systematically reduce political engagement by everyday Americans all around you. . .

Knowing that a key element in winning that battle is restoring accountability at all levels of politics, which means running everywhere and holding extremists accountable everywhere. . .

Knowing that this battle is far bigger than Donald Trump—that it started before he ever ran, and will continue long after he’s gone from the scene—and that many who are attacking democracy do it far more politely, subtly, and effectively than he does, _right near you. . ._

And, knowing that there is so much _you_ can do to help win this battle, and that the scale of the attack on democracy _requires_ that we all do more. . .

Knowing all of that. . . what are _you_ going to do?

I hope your answer is to find your inner Rhoda Denison Bement.

I hope your answer is to resolve that saving democracy is now part of your core mission, and to dedicate your entire footprint to the cause.

I hope you see from the plan you’ve put together throughout this book, and from the examples set by Vashitta, Meg, Kim, Michelle, Ebony, Rachel, and others, that there is so much you can do, right now, to lift democracy. Far more than you ever have. And in ways that are absolutely necessary.

And I hope your answer is to start that work _now_. And spur others to do the same.

**The Opportunity of this Moment**

Why now?

First, because it’s a long game, the other side has a big head start, and we’ve been fighting this battle the wrong way for too long. The sooner we fight it the right way, the better.

But as I wrap up this book in April 2023, _this_ moment in time offers unique opportunities to get started.

For the first time in a long time, people are waking up to the threat democracy faces. Many are no longer under the illusion that democracy simply sustains itself. That broader awareness—that needed realism—is critical.

Also at this moment, momentum is building around the very type of focus and infrastructure it will take to protect democracy. Stacey Abrams and others showed the way with what they built in Georgia. Run for Something is showing the way by recruiting candidates everywhere, and Tech for Campaigns is showing the way by helping so many of them. We saw that new focus, energy and infrastructure fuel those secretary of state and statehouse victories in 2022. We see it in Rachel Coyle’s advocacy work at the Ohio Statehouse, in 1,100 people joining Blue Ohio in only five months, and in Kim Allen’s Power the Vote. We see it during NFL games, on doctor’s badges across the country, and in numerous ways other companies are using their footprints to lift democracy.

So we’re not starting from scratch. Thanks to some visionary and persistent leaders, and a surging army of democracy champions, there’s long-needed infrastructure growing from the bottom up. It’s working, and it’s gaining momentum.

And it’s growing at the exact moment where we can win the messaging battle we’ve lost for too long.

Think about it. . . in the next few years, the image of the GOP will be of Marjorie Taylor Greene making a mess of the US House. All extremism, all the time. As with too many statehouses, no good public outcomes—not even attempts to address them. She and her cohort of extremists will look just like those losing secretary of state candidates looked in Arizona and Nevada, but under a far brighter spotlight and with the whole nation watching. Then throw in Trump and other extremists battling it out in the presidential primary. Over who can most ruthlessly ban abortion. Who can ban the most books. Who can veer the furthest from mainstream American values. Despite Mitch McConnell’s and others’ best efforts, their toxic extremism will be out in the open.

All the while, the disastrous public outcomes of governance with no accountability continue to play out before our eyes. Brett Favre’s volleyball courts. Derailments and chemical spills due to lack of regulation. Crumbling schools and towns. A GOP that, unlike every American, risks economic meltdown because it refuses to pay bills its own policies racked up.

The ads write themselves.

If we go on offense in our messaging, we can fully expose those attacking democracy for what they are: extremists delivering terrible results for the American people wherever and whenever they are in charge. While we make clear that those fighting for democracy represent the mainstream values of everyday Americans, and are fighting for the outcomes they care about.

So that growing infrastructure, and that sharp contrast, offer an enormous and immediate opportunity.

BUT. . . we squander that opportunity if we repeat what we’ve done for a generation. If we only harness that advantage and momentum in a few swing states to win the House, Senate, and presidency in 2024. As if that’s the entire battle.

Instead, we must take advantage of the moment by going all in for the broader and longer battle for democracy we now understand that we’re in.

What does that look like?

It means that our ’23 and ’24 pro-democracy work is not simply about the presidency and a few federal offices. It’s bigger, and deeper, and broader.

It means we don’t waste time gawking as the GOP primary plays out in 2023 and early 2024. But as their candidates careen into all sorts of crazy places, we’re doing the pro-democracy work required to make gains in ’23 (hello Virginia!), and to prepare for ’24.

And in preparing for ’24, it means we build for a battle for democracy everywhere—where the other side is waging it, and where democracy is shaped. By engaging voters through all of our footprints. Recruiting candidates in every district, and giving them meaningful support. Protecting voters. Becoming information warriors. Putting our money where democracy is. Bringing accountability wherever it is needed. And beginning now to build an infrastructure that values running everywhere. (Below is a quick sketch of what that might look like.)

It’s go time. Democracy is on the line.
