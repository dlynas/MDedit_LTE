1 INTRODUCTION:  WHERE DID IT GO? | The Rigor of Angels: Borges, Heisenberg, Kant, and the Ultimate Nature of RealityINTRODUCTION:  WHERE DID IT GO?Shortly before 10:00 on the evening of May 21, 1927, a plane dropped out of the clouds northwest of Paris. After flying over the city and twice circling the Eiffel Tower, it headed northeast toward the normally sleepy airfield at Le Bourget. No one could have been more surprised than the plane’s single pilot, an unknown American who looked more boyish than his twenty-fi ve years, to see the teeming crowds awaiting him. When he landed his plane at 10:32 that night, the young man had been flying for more than thirty- three hours. By the time he fell asleep early the next morning— after fighting free from the crowds that pulled him from his plane, talking to the crush of international press that had gathered to cover his unprecedented feat, and taking a hot bath at the ambassador’s residence in Paris—h e had been awake for more than sixty hours.1By becoming the first human being to fly alone across the Atlantic, Charles Lindbergh went from an unassuming postal pilot to the world’s most famous person—l iterally overnight. His accomplishment was an example of extraordinary skill and courage, one that  xii many others had failed to achieve in the years and months before, often perishing in the process. But the crowds at Le Bourget, and later in New York, and indeed everywhere Lindbergh would go from then on, weren’t just celebrating one man’s exploit.For underlying Lindbergh’s undeniable skill—h is flawless navigation alone and at night; his constant adjustment of altitude; his nerve- racking battle with fatigue—w as a magnificent edifice of science and engineering that had just propelled a single human being in little more than a day across a distance that had previously required weeks and even months. This was an extension of the stunning human capacity for knowledge that had in recent centuries navigated the globe and built the railroads and would eventually place a man on the moon. A triumph of engineering, to be sure, but also of the laws of motion that Sir Isaac Newton had put to paper more than two hundred years earlier, and that had been powering humanity’s remarkable progress ever since. For in tracing that path from Roosevelt Field in New York to Le Bourget, Charles Lindbergh had moved a greater distance in a shorter time than any human in history. Little could he know that barely a thousand kilometers from the airport where he landed that evening, the very idea of what it means for an object to move through space was being turned on its head forever.as lindbergh was making his historic flight, another young man was being driven to distraction in a quiet dwelling in Copenhagen. That was where the Danish physicist and Nobel laureate Niels Bohr waged a daily war of attrition against his twenty-fi ve- year- old German assistant, Werner Heisenberg, dismantling the young man’s most recent paper in a relentless series of bombardments.While not yet the full professor he would become later that year when he accepted the chair of theoretical physics at Leipzig, Heisenberg had already laid the groundwork two years prior for what would be formalized by the end of 1927 as quantum mechanics—a  xiiimathematical model of hair- curling complexity whose power is such that it continues to hold today, almost a hundred years and at least that many profound discoveries later. Heisenberg would himself win the Nobel Prize five years later for one of the two watershed papers he had written as a twenty- three- year- old. But the current battles with Bohr were about a new discovery, one that would shake the foundations of science and thought and be forever attached to Heisenberg’s name.The debate revolved around the ultimate nature of reality. Classical physics had always assumed that objects followed the same laws of motion no matter their size. However, in 1913, Bohr had demonstrated that inside the atom electrons behaved rather differently than macroscopic objects, in that they occupied distinct orbits around the nucleus and appeared to “jump” from one to the other.2 The problem was this: If I jump from one step to another on my stairs, everyone will grant that I continue to exist along the way. Paradoxically, however, electrons show up in their new orbit without seeming to have traveled in between. Moreover, they seem not even to exist until they are detected, at which point they “decide” where they have been all along. It was as if Charles Lindbergh didn’t exist while crossing the Atlantic, and only came back into being when he was sighted over France.on a saturday afternoon of the previous year, a deliriously happy young poet arrived at a party in Buenos Aires. Erudite, foppish, and timid, Jorge Luis Borges, known as Georgie to his friends, was attending a birthday luncheon for a fellow writer at the boating pond in Palermo Park. The source of Borges’s delight was on his arm that day, a rising novelist and poet of Scandinavian descent named Norah Lange.It had been a good year for Borges. The Buenos Aires literary scene was starting to pull back from its sycophantic adulation of the European avant-g arde, whose once risqué leaders were wealthy, set-xiv tled, and now far more likely to be feted and pampered by the bourgeoisie than to shock them. This shift favored Borges, whose poetry at the time tended toward the romantic and locally flavored. While thoroughly cosmopolitan, his tastes were anchored in Argentina to the point where he and his literary compatriots would shower disdain on the musicians who dared to play faddish new forms of tango at the famed Café Tortoni.In this group of friends Norah Lange shone like a lodestar. As one of the companions would later recount, deep into a night of drinking they would slip out to the corner bar “with the goddesses of that Wagnerian paradise.” Upon returning, “Norah, she of the long flaming hair, would regain her throne and scepter, extend both hands to silence the uproar, and proceed to recite . . . , her poems never failing to calm the storm and induce a sunrise of the purest emotion.”3 Indeed, in some of those poems we can sense her ardor for her lover and mentor Borges, which she likens to the “dew drawn to a freshly opened rose.”4Borges, for his part, felt alive like never before. And his writing reflected that. The words of a poet, of any writer, had to amount to a fusion of souls, imparting the truths of one’s innermost experience; writing was to be “a full confession of the self.”5 Even under a fictional facade, the author’s autobiographical substance would be “like a heart beating in the depths.”6 Indeed, it would be fair to say that the relationship with Norah had provoked some uncharacteristic writing on Borges’s part. Carlos Mastronardi, a fellow writer and friend, would later recall that for one of the few times in his life Borges seemed to have little desire to be anyone other than himself. As Borges wrote at the time in an essay with the distinctly un- Borgesian title “Writing Happiness,” he couldn’t imagine “the negation of all consciousness, of all sensation, of all differentiation in time or space.”7 Mastronardi’s surprise was justified. His friend had a well- deserved reputation for morbid obsessions and had publicly mused that a human being’s sense of consciousness and identity over time was little else than a desperate illusion veiling xvan existential void.Sadly, for Borges, if not for literary posterity, this reverie was not to last. On that spring afternoon at the party beside the lake, Norah shared a table with another writer, Oliverio Girondo, whose ease at conversation and charm with women contrasted starkly with Borges’s own awkward demeanor. As they chatted and drank, a tipsy Norah upset a bottle of red wine. Oliverio, never at a loss for words, leaned in and quipped, “Blood will flow between us.”8 The woman who came on Georgie’s arm was soon dancing with Oliverio. She would leave with him as well.immanuel kant was obsessed with his bowels. During the summer of 1776, when elsewhere revolution was in the air, Kant couldn’t take a shit. A hypochondriacal bachelor in his early fifties and an established professor at the local university, he was in most respects entirely healthy. Indeed, he would live for another twenty- eight years, far longer than most of his friends and colleagues. Still, Kant’s digestive worries were a matter of great consequence. As he took his daily walks that summer, he had yet to publish a single one of the seminal works that would later earn his place as the founder of modern philosophy. His inability to get his gut in order was causing him to have confused thoughts— a considerable obstacle for someone aiming to put philosophy’s house in order. Finally published five years later, those thoughts would be complicated enough for those who would endeavor to read them, but in his current state of distraction Kant could barely make sense of them himself.Not that Kant wished his philosophy to be abstruse. Unlike some traditionalists who railed against the idea that the human mind should be planted with more ideas than those needed for each person to become adept at his or her calling, Kant believed in the democratic diffusion of knowledge. That same year the conservative thinker J. G. Schlosser wrote, “Why do you castrate oxen and colts when you prepare them for the yoke and the cart, yet wish to xvi develop the totality of human powers in men similarly condemned to the yoke and the cart?”9 Kant wholly and passionately opposed such prejudice. To deprive a human being, any human being, of the opportunity to cultivate his or her own mind was to undermine the free use of reason that Kant believed an essential part of being human. To achieve that universality, though, Kant’s own philosophy would require both clarity and precision. Already the lecture he gave on the occasion of attaining the rank of magister years earlier had been titled “Of the Easier and More Thorough Presentation of Philosophy”— evidence of his conviction that education should be universally accessible, yes, but also a source of irritation to the generations since who have naturally found Kant’s major philosophical works to be rather tough going.It was the first of those works, published in the summer of 1781, that would lay the groundwork for all philosophy to come. The volume in question, the famed Critique of Pure Reason, is a doorstop of a book. As Kant’s fellow philosopher and frequent correspondent Johann Georg Hamann remarked upon receiving the proofs, “Such a fat book is neither fitting for the author’s stature nor for the concept of pure reason, which he opposes to such lazy- assed reason as my own.”10 But in its impressive heft Kant had distilled several decades of thinking about the very limits of human knowledge and, specifically, how a failure to recognize and take account of those limits would produce mind- boggling paradoxes, paradoxes that had been bewildering human beings for millennia.the middle- class son of a classics professor, Heisenberg excelled at pretty much everything. Athletic, a committed scout and outdoorsman, and a talented pianist, he could have chosen any number of academic or artistic paths. But of all his talents, Heisenberg showed a particular aptitude for math. At sixteen he was already tutoring local university students in the subject. And it was his prowess with a pencil and an iconoclastic attitude toward long-a ccepted xviicertainties that led to his first landmark: a backbreaking latticework of calculations able to account for the strange disappearances and reappearances of fundamental particles.To Heisenberg’s chagrin, in the year after he published his groundbreaking paper laying the cornerstone of quantum mechanics, an older, more established physicist published a theory he called wave mechanics. For the theorists who were wrestling with the herculean “matrix algebra” Heisenberg’s approach required, the urbane Erwin Schrödinger’s elegant and relatively simply calculations were a relief. Even Heisenberg had to admit Schrödinger’s equation was easier to work with. To Heisenberg’s great annoyance, however, Schrödinger wasn’t willing to let the math stand on its own. Instead, he insisted on using the language of classical physics to try to visualize what was going on at the quantum level.Brash and headstrong, Heisenberg averred that quantum mechanics constituted an entirely new physical model; if its conclusions seemed strange or even paradoxical, so be it. Schrödinger would have none of this. He believed his elegant equation described real, physical waves and that electrons, photons, and other particle-l ike manifestations of matter or energy appeared like frothy wave caps on a tumultuous sea. If we don’t know exactly when and where such a cap will present itself, that’s merely because we can’t see sharply enough to make out the water beneath the surface, not because the wave isn’t there.Both Heisenberg and Niels Bohr disagreed, believing quantum discontinuity was real. But where Heisenberg was ready to jettison the continuous model of classical physics altogether, Bohr wanted to hold on to it and find a way to make the two modes communicate. This was the source of their arguments from late 1926 into the spring of 1927. In fact, the strife got so intense that in February, Bohr and his wife decided to go skiing. Without Heisenberg. It was during those weeks of relative solitude that Werner had his breakthrough.xviii back in buenos aires, Borges nursed his broken heart. The months since Norah rejected him had been one long onslaught of recurrent humiliations. Oliverio had decamped for Europe, leaving behind a love- struck Norah and luring Borges with desperate hopes of reconciliation. But his almost daily attempts to call on Norah, which play out in a roman à clef she published less than a year later, served only to remind him how cold her heart had turned to the man for whom she had once written the most impassioned poems.Norah dealt Borges a fatal blow on a late April day, in the form of a review she published of his latest book of poems with the icy title “Thinking of Jorge Luis Borges in Something That Does Not Quite Manage to Be a Poem.”11 The despair that ensued waxed philosophical. Where before the final rupture Borges had rhapsodized about the confessional transparency of writing, the bond it could fuse between two lovers, he now sounded his first notes of skepticism. Far from a medium of communion between two souls, language had become a “hemisphere of lies and shadows,” the “fickle and contingent” meaning of words constituting “the general tragedy of all writing.”12 He now believed the promise of transcending the fundamental opacity of words was but a fantasy, a power only angels possessed, forever denied to those he termed “never-a ngels,” the ultimate and irreducible status of mortals.13The loss of his beloved changed Borges. Soon he would publish his last poem for many years, during which time he would turn almost exclusively to the short-f orm fiction and essays that would earn him his place in history. It would be more than thirty years before Jorge Luis Borges would be snatched from the relative obscurity of Buenos Aires by receiving, along with Samuel Beckett, the 1961 International Publishers’ Prize, in an instant transforming a depressive Argentine nebbish into one of the world’s most lionized and influential writers. For now, however, he snapped out of his temporary reveries and returned to a more potent suspicion that the self’s experience of permanence and solidity in time and space was illusory.xix In short, he started thinking about tortoises.in the months prior to Heisenberg’s stay at Bohr’s house in Copenhagen, physicists had been aware of a nagging problem. It seemed that their models could home in on the location of a particle quite well; they could also describe its momentum with impressive accuracy. Maddeningly, however, they didn’t seem able to do both. As Heisenberg’s friend and colleague Wolfgang Pauli put it, it was as if one of your eyes could see a particle’s momentum and the other could see its position, “but if you open both eyes at the same time you will go crazy.”14One cold winter evening while the Bohrs were away skiing, Heisenberg took a walk in a park not far from their house. It was on this walk that he came upon his solution: the image of a discrete object moving through time and space that had been so successful for classical physics—i ndeed, that would manifest itself in Lindbergh’s famous flight later that very spring—s imply didn’t apply to the behavior of reality at the quantum level. It wasn’t merely that the physicist isn’t able to see a particle’s position and momentum at the same time; astoundingly, the particle doesn’t have a momentum and a position in any meaningful sense until the physicist decides to measure one or the other.Werner knew he was onto something. But he was sure Bohr would have objections, and he desperately wanted to get his ideas out into the world. After a rapid correspondence with Pauli, who reacted enthusiastically, Heisenberg took advantage of his mentor’s absence and feverishly wrote an article he submitted on March 22 to Germany’s leading journal of physics. A few weeks later he wrote a summary for nonspecialists in which he explained that quantum phenomena required us to put aside Newtonian mechanics. When it comes to quanta he wrote, “the more precisely we determine the position, the more imprecise is the determination of velocity.”15This fact had profound consequences for the most basic assump-xx tions of the classical scientific worldview. Since Newton had exposited the laws of motion, scientists had accepted the notion proposed most famously by the French mathematician Pierre- Simon Laplace, that perfect knowledge of an object’s position and momentum and the forces acting on it in the present will yield perfect knowledge of all its future permutations. Heisenberg’s discovery put this determinism to rest. As he put it, “In the strict formulation of causal law— if we know the present, we can calculate the future—i t is not the conclusion that is wrong but the premise.”16 The uncertainty principle, as it came to be known, showed with inescapable, mathematical precision that such full knowledge of the present moment wasn’t just hard to pin down; it was actually impossible.the tortoises that populated Borges’s imagination were twenty- five hundred years old. One afternoon in Athens, a young philosopher named Socrates came to the Agora to meet a venerable thinker, Parmenides, who was visiting from the far- off land of Elea. Parmenides had brought with him a tall, handsome acolyte named Zeno. Zeno had become known for a brief book he had written to demolish all those who would seek to oppose Parmenides’s doctrines. Motion, he argued, was an illusion. To demonstrate his point, he told a fanciful parable about the great warrior Achilles facing a tortoise in a foot race. The gist of the story was that as long as the tortoise had a head start to begin with, Achilles could never catch up. That’s because to cross any distance at all, Achilles would first have to cross some fraction of it, and then a fraction of the remaining distance, and so on. A bit like making a cookie last forever by only ever eating half of what remains, even though the distances Achilles would have to cross would grow infinitely smaller, there was also no limit to how many of such distances he would have to cross. Ergo, Zeno concluded, Achilles could never catch up.Shortly after losing Norah Lange, Borges had become fascinated with Zeno’s paradox.xxiHe reviewed the history of “solutions” to the problem, ultimately concluding that most of them were simply expositions rather than refutations. Where the great John Stuart Mill had pointed out that while Achilles may indeed run forever, that “eternity will not see the end of twelve seconds,” Borges dryly countered, “That methodical dissolution, that boundless descent into more and more minute precipices, is not really hostile to the problem; imagining it is the problem.”17 It is we who create the problem, Borges realized, by the very way we imagine the race. We attribute to Achilles and to the tortoise (as we do to ourselves and indeed to all objects) a persistence in time and space. When we slice time and space into the infinitesimal chunks that Achilles and the tortoise have to cross, we simultaneously impose on them and their experience a fabricated continuity of our own design. We imagine, in other words, a continuous movement between and beneath our measurements of their progress.The paradox of Zeno, Borges wrote, “is an attempt upon not only the reality of space but the more invulnerable and sheer reality of time. . . . [E]xistence in a physical body, immobile permanence, the flow of an afternoon in life, are challenged by such an adventure.”18 Like Heisenberg working feverishly on the other side of the world, as he explored the limits of perception, Borges peered into the abyss of an apparent paradox. And like Heisenberg, instead of shying away from this paradox, he chose to reexamine his most basic assumptions about time, space, and causality.For the rest of his long and vibrant career, Borges would remain haunted by the flow of an afternoon in life, an afternoon when his beloved’s gaze turned elsewhere, and he lost faith in the persistence of his own being in space and time. Over decades, Borges would obsessively conjure characters whose special abilities and most urgent desires reveal for them a paradoxical disconnect between knowledge and the world.The greatest wizard, Borges speculated, would be the one whose spell is so convincing that he could fool even himself into believing xxii its appearances were real. “Would this not be our case?” he asks.19 And then adds, “We (the undivided divinity operating within us) have dreamt the world. We have dreamt it as firm, mysterious, visible, ubiquitous in space and durable in time; but in its architecture we have allowed tenuous and eternal crevices of unreason which tell us it is false.” Where do we find those crevices of unreason? Borges leaves one further clue as to the hidden protagonist of the adventure challenging our notions of time and space: “Let us admit what all idealists admit: the hallucinatory nature of the world. Let us do what no idealist has done: seek unrealities which confirm that nature. We shall find them, I believe, in the antinomies of Kant.”20the stated purpose of the colossus that Hamann received in 1781 was to put science on a sure footing. That footing had, for Kant, been shaken by the writings of a gloomy Scot by the name of David Hume, whom Kant credited with having “interrupted my dogmatic slumber.”21 (Indeed, a professor of mine once complained that the worst thing Hume ever did was awaken Kant and thus subject posterity to having to read him.) According to Hume, absolutely everything we know about the world comes from our senses. Not only does this mean we can easily be wrong about what we think we know; even worse, we have no basis to suppose that such “certainties” as Isaac Newton’s laws of motion are anything other than habits we’ve acquired through repeated exposure to similar impressions.This notion troubled Kant. If it were true, it would upend his faith in the universality of reason, the very basis for our claim to derive scientific laws that explain the world around us. Every attempt to say something true about the world would have no more validity than a subjective assertion. And if objective truth about the world were lost, there could be no basis for arbitrating disputes about morality or, much less, taste. Soon after reading Hume, Kant believed he had discovered a way forward. But more than a decade would pass from the first fits and starts of his thinking to the morning of July 22, xxiii 1781, when the printed and bound Critique of Pure Reason would land with a propitious thud on Hamann’s breakfast table.What Kant managed to work out in his Critique is something so profound that few people fully grasp its implications even today. Hume and pretty much everyone else had made an unwarranted assumption about what goes on when we perceive something. That assumption is that we are correct in visualizing reality in itself as being consistent with our image of it. But our perceptions, Kant realized, aren’t things in the world; rather, they are versions of those things that we construct in our minds by shaping them in space and time. When we imagine the world as being identical to our conception of it— when we assume, specifically, that space and time are fundamentally real— our reason becomes faulty, and science responds with paradox.Kant didn’t stop there. In the second half of the book he went on to describe in detail the kinds of paradoxes that pop up when we fail to make this distinction and mistakenly assume that time and space are inherent to the world. He called one class of these errors antinomies— those crevices of unreason that Borges credited with confirming the hallucinatory nature of the world. Specifically, Kant wrote, we can picture reality as being consistent and continuous, or as being broken into discrete chunks, and we can make perfectly logical and coherent arguments supporting both conclusions even though those conclusions explicitly contradict each other. This happens because we assume something about reality that only comes into play when we observe it.heisenberg was convinced it made no sense to think of particles having position or momentum prior to observing one or the other. He also believed he knew why. A particle’s trajectory, the course it runs, didn’t come into being until it was realized by the act of measuring it. What we know to be the case for Lindbergh, that he continued to exist after leaving Nova Scotia and before appearing again xxiv in the skies over Paris, and that he took a specific path to get there, simply is not the case for reality at its smallest levels. Heisenberg wrote to Wolfgang Pauli of his mind- bending discovery in words that would go on to shake the foundations of modern science: the path a particle takes “only comes into existence through this, that we observe it.”22Like Borges’s wizard, when we observe the world, we make a map or mental picture of it. And we make that map ubiquitous in space and durable in time. But there are fundamental flaws in the image we create of the world, those that Kant termed antinomies. Like an imperfection in an otherwise flawless gemstone, it would be a mistake to try to eradicate them. For the flaws are inseparable from knowledge itself.On a walk together in 1926, a venerated older scientist pressed the younger Heisenberg on the weakness he saw disqualifying his approach— that he was jettisoning our long- held belief in the independence of reality from our observations of it. Heisenberg pushed back. Had not the renowned professor himself come up with his own epochal discovery by overturning our most basic assumptions about time and space?“Possibly I did,” Albert Einstein grudgingly conceded, “but it is nonsense all the same.”23one of the great tools humans have developed since the rise of modernity is science. At its core science is a way of looking at the world that foregrounds intellectual humility. It refuses on principle to know more than it can know at any given time. But even the greatest scientists aren’t immune to projecting their prejudices on the world. Einstein— a man so brilliant that even his self-p roclaimed blunders have an irritating propensity to turn out true—a lso had a tendency, especially in his later years, to lecture his fellow physicists in religious terms about what they should expect to discover about the ultimate nature of reality. In fact, his now famous quips about xxvGod being subtle but not malicious, or “the Old One” not throwing dice, finally led an exasperated Niels Bohr to beg the great man to “stop telling God what to do.”24For all their profound differences, Jorge Luis Borges, Immanuel Kant, and Werner Heisenberg shared an uncommon immunity to the temptation to think they knew God’s secret plan. Each in his own way resisted the urge to project essential aspects of how human beings experience reality onto reality itself, independent of how we know it. Indeed, Heisenberg’s disruption of classical physics had its roots in an iconoclastic countercurrent to a powerful human tendency to conjure the ultimate nature of reality in our imagination, and then go out and discover it. There is indeed rigor in the world, as Borges famously wrote, but “humanity has forgotten, and continues to forget, that it is the rigor of chess masters, not of angels.”25Knowledge is man- made, our own way of making sense of a reality whose ultimate nature may not conform to our conceptions of it. Is the saturated red of a Vermeer part of that ultimate reality? The soft fuzz of a peach’s skin? The exalted crescendo of a Beethoven symphony? If we can grasp that such powerful experiences require the active engagement of observers and listeners, is it not possible, likely even, that the other phenomena we encounter have a similar origin? When we do the opposite, we forget the role we have in creating our own reality.In their lives, struggles, and obsessions, Borges, Heisenberg, and Kant pushed far enough against the limits of imagination, observation, and thought to unearth the antinomies engendered by that forgetting. This book is divided into four sections, each of which revolves around one of those antinomies: Are space and time infinitely divisible, or are they composed of indivisible chunks? Is there something like a supreme and unconditional being, or is everything in existence conditioned and affected by something else? Is there a spatial or temporal edge to the universe, or does it extend infinitely with no beginning or border? Are we free to choose our path in life, or is our every choice determined by the physical world we live in?26xxvi The sections in turn contain three chapters, each of which focuses primarily on one of our protagonists, the influences that were decisive for him, how he grappled with that antinomy in the realm of science, literature, or philosophy, and how that struggle ultimately paved the path toward his understanding of how knowledge structures reality. Thus our story opens, however improbably, with a Russian journalist who discovers he has a gift that is also a curse: a near- perfect memory. We then join Borges as he, prodded by the desire to recover the receding moments of bliss of a shattered romance, probes the paradoxes of what memory and perception entail. Using fiction to file away at the imperfections of human knowledge, he imagines a character who can perceive and remember everything, perfectly, with no gap in space or loss in time. In so doing he reveals the very insight that ignited Kant’s revolution in thought: an observation of the world can never be perfectly of the world; it always requires something else, the insertion of a minimal distance that permits it to become knowledge in the first place.In the chapters that ensue, we delve into the realm of the impossibly small; we stretch our minds to encompass everything at once; we travel to the beginning of time and the edge of existence; and we search for an iota of freedom in the mechanistic chain of nature. As we make this journey, we will be rocked by the astonishing implications that these thinkers’ collective discoveries had for our conceptions of beauty, science, and what we owe to each other in the brief time given to us in this universe.In telling the stories of Borges, Kant, and Heisenberg, this book also tells the story of those before them who caught a glimpse of the truth, who unearthed the tenuous and eternal crevices of unreason underlying our picture of the real. It tells a cautionary tale about the danger of assuming reality must conform to the image we construct of it, and the damage that our fidelity to such a seductive ideal can wreak. Most of all, it sings an ode to the boundless potential of our knowledge, once we have worked ourselves free from the blinders imposed by imagined perfection.

By 1922, niels bohr had become the world’s leading figure in the field of atomic structure. That year the director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at Göttingen University in Germany, a rigorously mathematical physicist named Max Born, invited Bohr to give a series of lectures. The picturesque university town would soon become one of three hot spots for the new theoretical physics along with Munich and Copenhagen. Max Born himself would become one of the field’s founding fathers, before being hounded from his post with Germany’s other top Jewish scientists. Bohr’s lectures in Göttingen drew physicists from around Europe and had all the trappings of a major cultural event. Attendees even took to referring to the series as the “Bohr Festival.”1 It was in Göttingen that Bohr laid out his new model for the atomic structure, with electrons confined to “shells” determined by their energy level. And it was in Göttingen that a twenty- year- old student who was visiting for a semester to work with Born also attended the Bohr Festival before returning to Munich to complete his doctorate. Unbeknownst to either professor, in only three more years that student

would make the first of a series of discoveries that would definitively close the door on classical physics.

today we might call a young man who is athletic, conscientious, and ambitious a “boy scout.” In Werner Heisenberg’s case, the term applied literally as well as figuratively. The younger of two brothers born into a bourgeois family in Munich, Werner was sickly as a young child, almost dying of a lung infection when he was just five. Indeed, he suffered from intermittent allergies much of his life, which makes his strong attachment to the outdoors and scouting all the stranger. When Heisenberg arrived in Göttingen from Munich to join the team of researchers there in 1922, Born said he looked “like a simple peasant boy, with short, fair hair, clear bright eyes and a charming expression.”2

The peasant boy had qualified to work with Born for good reason. In school he had excelled in all disciplines, although early on he was drawn by the beauty of mathematics, in particular its correspondence to the real world and its seeming magical ability to solve practical problems and predict real outcomes, a correspondence that struck him “as remarkably strange and exciting,” as he later recalled.3 His mathematical abilities quickly blossomed, and when his parents asked the sixteen-y ear- old boy to help a friend of the family’s with her university math courses, he had taught himself calculus so he could in turn teach it to her. By the time he had to present his own skills for graduation from high school, his examiner could write with some amazement of the “playful ease” with which he solved Newton’s equations of motion, “with air resistance taken into account.”4

Despite this background, Born’s initial assessment wasn’t far off the mark. Heisenberg had indeed been working as something akin to a simple peasant boy—a s a farmhand, in fact, trying to support himself and his family in the economic and social devastation that was Germany of the immediate postwar years.5 His hometown of

47

Munich had devolved into chaos after the armistice, with armed political factions roaming the streets and claiming sections of the city as their fiefdoms. Heisenberg would recall fleeing “the sounds of shooting, without knowing where the fighting was.”6 From the dust and disruption on the streets, he found solace in the countryside and mountains, and in conversations and the world of ideas. Specifically, Platonic ideas.

One particularly violent morning, he found his way to the roof of his school building. Safe for the time being from the danger of the streets, he sat there soaking in the morning sun before fishing a volume out of his book bag and starting to read, his legs dangling from the edge of the rooftop.7 It was Plato’s dialogue Timaeus, which recounts the philosopher’s speculations as to the fundamental makeup of the world. The son of a classics professor, Heisenberg had more occasion than most young men his age to read Greek philosophy, and he found in Plato’s dialogue Timaeus an idealist counterpoint to the erector- set diagrams of his science classroom. In its pages the philosopher speculated that all the substances of the world were reducible to a few elements, invisible building blocks whose geometry determined their properties. Of these elemental particles Plato wrote, “The first thing the god then did was give them their distinctive shapes, using forms and numbers.”8 By way of a complex analysis, Plato decided that earth, the basis for all solids, is made of quadrangles and that each of the remaining elements— water, air, and fire—a ssumes its relative mobility and particular quality from its size and shape: “In all these cases the body that has the fewest faces is of necessity the most mobile, in that it, more than any other, has edges that are the sharpest and best fit for cutting in every direction.”9

Heisenberg didn’t swoon. As he later recalled, “The whole thing seemed to be wild speculation, pardonable perhaps on the ground that the Greeks lacked the necessary empirical knowledge.”10 Yet Plato had also planted a seed. When Heisenberg had learned about the structure of atoms in school, Bohr’s innovations had not yet

48

reached German schools, and as a result Heisenberg puzzled over his textbooks’ deeply unsatisfying _resources/books//The Rigor of Angels_ Borges Heisenberg K - William Egginton of atoms held together in molecules by “hooks and eyes . . . , quite arbitrary structures whose shape could be altered at will to adapt them to different technical tasks”— not quite what the young thinker would expect of a physics that was supposed to be “governed by strict natural laws.” As crazy as a world constructed of tiny pyramids and tetrahedrons sounded, did colored balls held together by hooks seem much saner? Wouldn’t it make more sense to conceive of atoms not as concrete models taken from our everyday experience but as ideas constructed via mathematical proofs? As he would later reflect, “I was gaining the growing conviction that one could hardly make progress in modern atomic physics without a knowledge of Greek natural philosophy.”11

The other aspect of Greek thought that infiltrated Heisenberg’s early consciousness was its dialogic nature. Escape from the violence of the streets also meant leaving the city for the countryside, which Heisenberg did as often as he could. With his friends he would hike the fields and mountains around Munich, using their rich conversations as a compass to guide them out of the bedlam of their daily lives. Heisenberg would later credit these walks as being among the primary inspirations for his passion for physics, for among the topics his friends and he would discuss was the nature of the physical world and our knowledge of it.

One clear day as they walked together through the hill country to the west of Lake Starnberg, they pushed through a clearing in the trees that revealed to them the expanse of the lake as it stretched to the mountains beyond. It was on this day, Heisenberg would later recall, that his desire to understand the natural world, right down to the level of its constituent parts, was born.12 The group had read many of the same books; works of Kant figured along with those of classical philosophy, and his influence seeped in as well. As they bantered away, free for a moment from the maelstrom in the city below, Heisenberg began to grasp a concept that would be decisive for his later work as a physicist. When we explore the natural world,

49

we don’t see things directly as they are in themselves but translate them first into mental _resources/books//The Rigor of Angels_ Borges Heisenberg K - William Egginton and then finally into concepts. It is only when we have filtered our bare impressions through concepts that we can say we have experienced them.

Concepts were words, of course, and words were what flowed back and forth in dialogues. Each dialogue could only take place within a group of at least two members. No one on his or her own owned the truth. But truth could emerge slowly from the negotiation between the participants in the conversation. What one needed to look for was something not available to any individual on his or her own. Heisenberg thought of this as “the middle ground,” a place where truth emerged from the relation between elements as opposed to residing in any one of them.

One day as he walked along Leopoldstrasse in Munich, a young man from one of the other groups that roamed the city approached and told him that the youth of the city had agreed to meet at Schloss Prunn, a medieval castle several hours to the north of the city. Something needed to be done; some solution to the daily struggles needed to be found. A train trip later, Heisenberg joined a growing group of young people, mostly students but also some former soldiers who had survived the horrors of the war, in the courtyard of the castle built high into the cliffside overlooking the Altmühl river valley. There they spent many hours debating the big questions posed by their current situation: whether the fate of their own people or that of the outer world was more important; whether those who had died in the war had done so in vain; what path would bring hope to their country and their future.

As he considered the various positions, the young Heisenberg became more and more conscious of how desperately lacking the middle ground was; no solution could be found as long as each group stuck to its guns. Suddenly there appeared on the balcony overlooking the courtyard a young man with a violin. As the sound of the opening double stop of the Chaconne from Bach’s Partita no. 2 in D Minor floated down into the courtyard, the assembled

50

youth stopped arguing and listened, and Heisenberg was struck by a sense of hope and possibility: “One could speak of a middle ground, open to all sides, in Plato, or in Bach, in the language of music or of philosophy or of religion, so there must also be such a space in our future.”13

Upon acing his final exams with customary ease in the spring of 1920, Heisenberg did what he would always do when he felt he had been working too much and needed to recharge his batteries. He went hiking with his group of friends, now officially a scout troop. His troop (called the Heisenberg group, under his leadership) had earned a reputation for pushing things a little far. He had recently fished one of his scouts out of a crevasse, and personally skied another down a mountain after the young man broke his leg. On this outing, however, Heisenberg almost did himself in. The boys stopped at a castle after a long day’s hike and asked if they could sleep inside. The keepers agreed and the boys settled in—w ithout being aware that it had served as a typhoid ward the previous year. Though none of his charges caught the illness, Heisenberg started to develop severe bellyaches and a high fever— telltale signs of typhoid. Indeed, he had contracted the deadly disease and was only nursed back to health by an uncle who happened also to be a family doctor and who managed to find him fresh eggs and milk each day despite the shortages of the postwar economy.14

Miraculously having managed a full recovery, the eighteen-y ear- old showed up for classes at the University of Munich the following fall. There he would study physics at one of the burgeoning centers of innovation on quantum theory: the institute run by the imposing and yet congenial Arnold Sommerfeld, where Heisenberg enrolled with another young superstar recently arrived from Vienna, Wolfgang Pauli. When Sommerfeld took a leave to teach in the United States less than two years later, he sent Heisenberg to work with Max Born in Göttingen, where he would become a central figure in the group responsible for what would soon be called the new Göttingen physics. But even before then, the freshman physics student in

51

Munich made his first in a series of advances that would set the stage for the development of quantum mechanics.

the age of quantum physics began in December 1900. The man who launched the most significant scientific revolution since Galileo did not come across as much of a rebel. Indeed, he was a hardworking, somewhat conservative man of science. It would be many years before he would accept the truth of what he had discovered, and he sought for the rest of his life to avoid its implications.

Already a well- established scientist, Max Planck made his most important mark at the relatively advanced age of forty-t wo, when he had held the chair in theoretical physics in Berlin for the previous eight years. He spent the previous half decade working on a problem that had bedeviled physicists for some time. If a receptacle, say a metal tube, is entirely closed off at both ends save for a tiny hole and then heated up, small amounts of electromagnetic energy will escape through the hole. This so- called black- body radiation can be analyzed by a spectrograph.15 Depending on the temperature of the tube, it will release small amounts of low-f requency waves and a much larger proportion of medium- frequency waves and then taper off again at the high end of the wavelength spectrum.

Curiously, these findings contradicted what scientists predicted should happen. If light were transmitted as a wave, as experts thought they had established, the amount of radiation should increase in proportion to the frequency of its wavelength. This makes sense. The smaller the waves spreading across a given surface, the more of them there are: think of the tiny ripples on a pond compared with the relatively scarce swells that big-w ave surfers wait for off the coasts of California or Portugal. This is true of all sorts of waves. The smaller the magnitude, the higher the frequency—m uch as a guitar string being tightened produces a higher pitch as its vibrations stir up smaller and faster air waves—a nd hence the higher the number of waves. And yet, for some reason, light bucks that trend. It’s a good

52

thing it does, too. If it did not, everyday lightbulbs would bathe us in deadly high- frequency radiation every time we turned them on— a theoretical expectation that scientists call, somewhat melodramatically, the ultraviolet catastrophe. That this catastrophe didn’t occur in reality was certainly comforting, but it didn’t make sense. And Max Planck wanted to know why.16

In the summer of 1900, Planck tried something new. He turned from the theory of electrodynamics to thermodynamics, specifically to that theory’s second law, which states that the entropy of a closed system increases over time. Entropy indicates a system’s disorder. An egg is highly ordered. An omelet less so. An omelet you have just chewed, swallowed, and digested, even less so. While it is relatively easy to turn that egg into a meal, it is far more difficult to reverse the process. That, in a nutshell, is entropy.

Planck, ever the old-s chool physicist, believed strongly that laws were laws, and that when they apply, they must apply without exception. If entropy is a law, that means that eggs always become more disordered, but the reverse never happens. This conviction led him to some rigorous debates with a dour Viennese physicist by the name of Ludwig Boltzmann. Boltzmann interpreted the second law of thermodynamics to mean that the entropy of any closed system would tend to increase, but that didn’t mean that it couldn’t decrease in individual cases. Gas molecules will indeed tend to evenly fill a room; however, it is possible that at any given moment they could all cluster together in one part of the room. Possible, but just very unlikely. Ironically, it was by borrowing his scientific opponent’s probabilistic model that Planck stumbled upon a solution to the riddle of black- body radiation.

For Boltzmann’s math to work, Planck had to provisionally break smooth quantities of whatever stuff he was measuring into chunks and then subject the movements of those chunks to statistical analysis. When Planck treated light frequencies as discrete, albeit very tiny, chunks, as opposed to smoothly diminishing wave sizes, he found that the expected distribution of wavelengths reverted to

53

what was found in the laboratory. In other words, by assuming electromagnetic waves had a kind of internal limit keeping them above a minimal size and hence below a maximal frequency, one avoided the ultraviolet catastrophe, and the number of high-f requency waves tapered off. He also managed to derive a specific value that determined the cutoff point at which the theory would conform to the experimental data. This value became known as Planck’s constant. Just as the speed of light is a constant with the notation c, this constant has its own notation as well, h. As we will soon see, it would become one of the most important numbers in modern physics and a key element of the quantum revolution to follow.

Planck, who continued to believe that light was propagated exclusively as waves, accepted this limitation as a kind of mathematical heuristic, but he didn’t believe it corresponded to a physical aspect of the light waves themselves. Instead, he thought this chunkiness might be a signature of the atoms emitting the light, that they could vibrate only at certain frequencies and hence admit or absorb light in specifically sized chunks, which he called “quanta.” In 1918, Planck won the Nobel Prize for his discovery and is still regarded as one of the most important figures in twentieth- century science. Nonetheless, as he would later reflect, “I can characterize the whole procedure as an act of despair”; “a theoretical interpretation had to be found at any price, however high it might be.”17 Yet, as unpalatable as it might have been for him, Planck seems to have known he had landed on something remarkable. That very December, he told his son about his discovery while on a walk in the Grunewald forest in Berlin. He described it as “a discovery of the first rank, comparable perhaps only to the discoveries of Newton.”18

That it certainly was. But it would take another scientist, arguably the greatest since Newton, to fully grasp what Planck had unearthed.

unlike max planck at the time of his discovery, Albert Einstein was virtually unknown when he authored four papers that would

54

constitute only the first volley of his immeasurable contributions to the history of science. In a year that has since gone down in scientific history as the most noteworthy since 1666, when Newton conjured up calculus, light spectrometry, and the theory of gravity in a flurry of creative genius, Einstein authored those four papers during a period of three months while working as a clerk in a patent office in Bern, Switzerland. In some ways the position he held couldn’t have suited him better. His gargantuan intellect allowed him to analyze patent applications with ample time left over to keep up on developments in physics. And for the previous few years, he had turned his attention to Planck’s curious discovery.

Einstein would quickly become by consensus the world’s most important physicist. And yet despite his influence and incredible fame, the Nobel committee would overlook him for more than fifteen years. When he did finally get the nod (at which point, weary of being snubbed for so many years, he declined to alter his travel plans and was lecturing in Japan when the award was bestowed on him), it was not for his paper on special relativity but for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which he advanced in a paper with the title “On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light.”19 As the title conveys, Einstein intended his theory as little more than a tool to help scientists along the way toward an answer, rather than being a final answer in itself. There is little doubt that the Nobel committee and the scientists who grudgingly overcame disciplinary inertia— as well as overt anti- Semitic propaganda— to honor him went out of their way not to award the prize for relativity. Still, even Einstein himself would later say that his paper on light, among all the others that year, was truly revolutionary.20

As is often the case, revolutionary steps can seem obvious in hindsight. As we’ve seen, Planck had shown that agitated atoms emit and absorb energy only at certain frequencies but was convinced this had something to do with the atoms, not the light. Nonetheless, in his address to the Berlin Physical Society at the end of 1900, 55 Planck unequivocally stated that his calculations showed energy emissions to be “composed of a very definite number of equal finite packages.”21 This finding astounded Einstein. As he later wrote, “All of my attempts to adapt the theoretical foundations of physics to this knowledge failed completely. It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under us, with no firm foundation to be seen anywhere.”22 In his 1905 paper, Einstein found that ground. And he did so by taking seriously the implications of Planck’s discovery. If light waves were emitted and absorbed in discrete packages, this wasn’t just a mathematical trick or feature of the atoms that emitted and absorbed them. Light itself had the curious ability to behave both as a wave and as a particle.

while einstein unsettled physics by showing that light could behave both as a wave and as a particle, scientists were making great strides digging deeper and deeper into the structure of those particles they already knew they had in hand, atoms. In this terrain a British physicist named Ernest Rutherford did the most important work. Working in his institute in Manchester, Rutherford unearthed the atomic structure we still recognize today: a nucleus orbited by a swarm of electrons. In 1912, he was joined by a young Niels Bohr, who would work with Rutherford for the next four years before returning to Copenhagen to found the institute there that would sear an indelible imprint on the physics of the twentieth century.

Perhaps Bohr’s most important quality as a scientist was his pragmatic lack of devotion to any particular approach. According to Rutherford’s model of the atom, electrons circled their nuclear cores like planets orbiting the sun in our solar system. The problem with this model is that it does not explain a key result of spectrographic analysis, namely, that the spectrum emitted by hydrogen atoms contains distinct dark lines between strips of color. Bohr realized that the dark lines represented energy levels that were somehow skipped as the energy emitted by the atoms’ electrons increased or

56

decreased. This told him two things. First, that electrons can change their orbits— thankfully something the earth and our neighboring planets do not do. Second, and even more strangely, when they do change, they do so instantaneously, without occupying any space between those orbits (in the atomic model these are really energy levels, not orbits). Bohr’s model of the atom thus retained classical elements of Rutherford’s, in that it depended on a picture of discrete particles circling a nucleus, but it also accurately predicted the experimental data that came from spectroscopy, which Rutherford’s had not been able to do.

Just as with Einstein’s light quanta, the electrons emitted and absorbed energy only in discrete chunks. This was consistent with their being particles. At the same time, if the electrons were indeed particles, one would assume that they would behave consistently as such and have the decency to continue existing in intermediate states. They did not. What they did do, however, was something that added to the mystery and showed scientists working on radiation and matter that their fields were inevitably converging on a common ground. When the electrons changed energy levels, the packets of energy they emitted or absorbed were calculable in precise proportion to Planck’s constant.

if planck’s discovery in 1900 unofficially ushered in the quantum revolution, Bohr’s paradoxical redefinition of the electron made it clear for all that a new physics was under way.

While Bohr’s centrality to the history of quantum physics is beyond dispute, many of his colleagues considered Bohr’s contributions to quantum theory more philosophy than physics. And while most agreed that his theory of complementarity—a ccording to which particles and waves are both pertinent descriptions of quantum events but neither can tell the whole story on its own—w as the philosophical linchpin of the Copenhagen interpretation, even his closest allies often seemed to have different opinions about what it

57

actually meant.

This confusion was partly due to Bohr’s way of speaking and writing. He loved to parse the details of a theory in conversation, asking his interlocutor for a possible interpretation and then poking holes in it, leading to ever greater exasperation but not necessarily to greater clarity. On one occasion this method drove Erwin Schrödinger, who was visiting him at the institute in Copenhagen, to take to his room for several days, ostensibly ill, but more likely to get away from Bohr’s incessant haranguing. Another Austrian physicist, Paul Ehrenfest, who, unlike Schrödinger, tended to side with Bohr in the controversies around the emerging quantum physics, would go so far as to complain of what he called Bohr’s awful incantations, “impossible for anyone else to summarize.”23

In the few years after Bohr presented his model of the atom with its strangely jumpy electrons, scientists around the world further advanced their understanding of the quantum discontinuity, including the mysterious way that Planck’s constant insisted on popping up like a persistent but uninvited guest. Egged on by Einstein’s claim that light also behaved as a particle, an American physicist at Caltech named Robert Millikan had spent nearly a decade working on a series of experiments intended to prove him wrong. In the process he not only firmly established that light does indeed propagate as quanta— which were now called photons— but also derived the most accurate yet value for Planck’s constant. Meanwhile, Einstein, having wrapped up that little problem called general relativity, turned his attention back to quantum physics, specifically to the question of when and how the nuclei of certain atoms spontaneously “decay,” emitting particles seemingly of their own accord.

This strange behavior had been recognized for almost two decades, having been discovered by Henri Becquerel and given the name radiation by Marie and Pierre Curie. Importantly, the decay and emission of particles by these elements happened without any external influence. Einstein’s epiphany this time (he had many of them) was that the sudden jumps in energy levels in Bohr’s atom

58

might work according to the same logic as the unpredictable decay seen in radioactive elements like uranium and radium. Turning again to Ludwig Boltzmann’s statistical models (Boltzmann himself, long suffering from what was likely bipolar disorder, had tragically committed suicide ten years earlier), Einstein worked out a model predicting the probability that radiation of a given energy level would shift to another level. Perhaps unsurprisingly at this point, Planck’s enigmatic constant again emerged as the beating heart of his equations. Bohr then adapted Einstein’s findings into his own expanding atomic model by showing that distinct bands in light spectra were due to certain energy levels being more or less probable than others.24

Einstein’s introduction of Boltzmann’s probabilistic mathematics into quantum behavior was akin to opening Pandora’s box into the world of classical physics. Einstein himself would resist the implications for the rest of his career, but for the time being, everyone, himself included, had to accept that, at least at the atomic level, nuclei decayed and electrons jumped up and down in energy levels— all without discrete identifiable causes. With large enough samples physicists could determine increasingly likely outcomes, but they could not know the outcome for any individual cases. Unlike in classical physics, quanta just seemed to do things without a reason.

If Einstein resisted his own findings, Bohr ran with them. His atomic model, with electron clouds forming “shells” in different numbers at different energy levels, allowed chemists to chart the similarities and differences of elements based on where they fell in the periodic table, with elements’ relative stability depending on the number of electrons that “liked” being together at a given energy level. As in other cases, Bohr’s gift was not to spend too much time or energy wondering why, but simply to accept and move on.

the structure of the atom laid out by Bohr had grown new lay-

59

ers of complexity each year, and Arnold Sommerfeld was largely responsible for its new attire. While Bohr had derived three quantum numbers from his analysis of hydrogen’s spectral lines, which he assigned to the size, shape, and orientation of the presumed orbits of electrons, closer analysis of the light bands revealed that they contained even smaller hairlines within them. It had fallen to Sommerfeld to account for this further splitting by adding a new number to the mix. The new value adequately matched the experimental data, but there didn’t seem to be a physical aspect of the atomic structure to pin it on, so Sommerfeld called it “hidden rotation” and moved on. Pauli— who had come to Sommerfeld’s seminar already well trained in physics, having written an introduction to Einstein’s two relativity theories that would go down in scientific history as a classic of the genre— didn’t think much of this nonchalance. But he recognized that Sommerfeld’s approach might have fertile ground in the proclivities of his new, less classically trained colleague. As he cynically told an eager Heisenberg, “It’s much easier to find one’s way if one isn’t too familiar with the magnificent unity of classical physics . . . , but then lack of knowledge is no guarantee of success.”25

True to Pauli’s expectations, Heisenberg made full use of his detachment from prior physical certainties. When Sommerfeld handed him the task of fully accounting for the observed oddities in spectral lines, the newly minted physics student came back with a mathematical answer in a surprisingly short time. While all previous numbers had been whole integer multiples of Planck’s famous constant, Heisenberg tried sequencing Sommerfeld’s enigmatic fourth number in terms of half integers. Amazingly, the move mapped beautifully onto the spectral data.

This made no sense at all according to any current understanding of how quanta behave. Indeed, the one seeming consistency of the quantum discontinuities reluctantly discovered by Planck and then affirmed by Einstein was that they couldn’t be further reduced. Sommerfeld initially refused Heisenberg’s solution. After all, he had given the young man this task only four weeks after he had 60 begun his studies. A brave stab, perhaps, but also rather impetuous. Soon thereafter Sommerfeld received a paper from an established theorist at Frankfurt named Alfred Landé that made precisely the same move. Sommerfeld promptly sent Landé a letter informing him that his calculation “agrees well with what has been found by one of my students (in the first semester) but which has not been published.”26 Even though rebuffed by his adviser and close circle, Heisenberg’s first foray was not in fact a bust. It would later turn out that a whole category of quantum particles exhibits behavior that can only be accounted for using Landé’s and, by extension, Heisenberg’s half integers. There can be little doubt the disappointment of this stolen scoop would fuel a future resistance to second-g uessing his intuitions.

when heisenberg entered the room for the Bohr Festival in Göttingen on a balmy spring day in June 1922, he was still only twenty years old. Given the importance of the occasion and the visitor, the front of the room was entirely taken by the faculty and senior students, and he duly took his seat in the back—w hich did not stop him from standing up after one of Bohr’s presentations to raise an objection, causing all the heads in the room to turn. Bohr for his part already knew of Heisenberg, having heard from Sommerfeld how his precocious student had come up with the half- integer curiosity. Intrigued, he went on a walk with the young man, after which they stopped for coffee and to talk physics. Heisenberg would later say his career began in earnest that day.

Over the course of the afternoon, their discussion waxed from the technical to the philosophical. Heisenberg wanted to know what Bohr really thought about the internal structure of those atoms. As the rush of mathematical discoveries in Munich, Göttingen, and Copenhagen further muddied the plausibility of an erector-s et atom with planetlike electrons orbiting the nucleus, how should physicists visualize what is really going on inside them? Bohr’s answer was

61

typical and tapped into a propensity in Heisenberg to think in similar terms: “When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating _resources/books//The Rigor of Angels_ Borges Heisenberg K - William Egginton and establishing mental connections.”27

This willingness to forgo assigning distinct, classical _resources/books//The Rigor of Angels_ Borges Heisenberg K - William Egginton to mathematical values was essential to the series of extraordinary advances Heisenberg was poised to make over the next five years. As the astronomer and philosopher of science Sir Arthur Eddington would write two years after Heisenberg’s greatest discovery (and ten years after definitively proving Einstein’s theory of general relativity), “No familiar conceptions can be woven round the electron. . . . Something unknown is doing we don’t know what— that is what our theory amounts to.”28 Eddington’s crisp British wit also led him to draw on that of a mathematician of the prior generation whose fame would come not from science but from letters. It would make as much sense, he added, to refer to electrons and quantum numbers with words such as those penned by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known to us as Lewis Carroll: “Eight slithy toves gyre and gimbal in the oxygen wabe.”29 For Eddington the words of quantum physics were no more descriptive of reality than the made- up jargon of Jabberwocky.

In 1924, Heisenberg moved to Göttingen to take up the post of Born’s assistant, which Pauli had just vacated. Progress on the atomic model had come to a standstill. As Bohr explained to a captive audience at Yale University the previous year, no one could take seriously anymore the image of electrons orbiting a nucleus like planets in a solar system. At the same time, no one quite knew what image to replace it with. Bohr’s own attempt, in a paper he wrote with his then- assistant Hans Kramers and the American physicist John Slater, ended up being a dead end, although it planted a seed. In it the three scientists had tried replacing the image of a discrete electron with something they called a “virtual oscillator,” in other words, some entity that behaved at the microscopic level like a rapidly vibrating pendulum or guitar string.30 Kramers would go on to develop the

62

idea mathematically and show that all spectrographic readings of light interference with atoms could indeed be calculated by assuming the right set of oscillators, but he resisted giving up the idea that underlying it all were particles moving in a classical way—t his despite the unnerving fact that a classical description of particles simply couldn’t account for the gaps that the quantum data insisted on producing.31 Heisenberg had no such qualms.

Heisenberg reasoned that when dealing with quanta, all scientists had to go on were experimental observations. In any given experimental situation dealing with electrons, one never “saw” the particle itself. Rather, what one saw was an initial energy state and a new state, measured at two different times. Whatever image we give the electron in between those states is doomed to remain a heuristic, no more useful to us than Lewis Carroll’s slithy tove. What was needed was not a different picture, a more or less slithy tove, but a dependable mathematical operation to describe the relationship between the two observable states.

Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz had each developed a version of calculus to deal with measurements of curved, continuous spaces. In this sense calculus is the mathematical tool par excellence for modeling the world as conceptualized by classical physics. For the discontinuous states of quanta, though, a different math was needed. A new math for a different kind of space and time, where no baseline continuity could be assumed, but rather rupture and discontinuity. In Göttingen, Max Born was hard at work on figuring out the kinds of calculations this would require. Heisenberg, working at his side, could see that Born’s endeavors were a kind of formal equivalent to Kramers and Bohr’s virtual oscillators, in that both assumed gaps and differences and not points or continuities as their foundation.32

Heisenberg’s recollection of the breakthrough rings overly modest. “The idea suggested itself,” he said in a lecture at St. Andrews University in Scotland some thirty years later, “that one should write down the mechanical laws not as equations for the positions and

63

velocities of the electrons,” but rather that one should work from the other direction: namely, start with the idea of frequencies and amplitudes, and then derive positions and velocities from those values.33

indeed, what merely “presented itself” this way was an idea as revolutionary as Einstein’s, twenty years earlier, that space and time are not immutable standards but are subject to change as the frame of reference relative to an observer encroaches on the speed of light. In Heisenberg’s case, he decided to treat the classical notions of position and momentum in a similar way, allowing that these long- stable notions might lose their coherence at very small frames of reference. In simple terms, Heisenberg decided to invert the relationship between particles and movement: movement is not something that happens to particles; particles are something we derive from observations about movement. He now began to see particles along the lines of the “middle ground” he had dreamed of at the meeting among youth factions at the castle on the Rhine, something that emerges from relations as opposed to residing in an individual.

For his calculations Heisenberg turned to something called a Fourier series, the mathematical notation for determining the position and velocity of an oscillating point—s ay, a given mark on a rapidly vibrating string as it completes one cycle—a s a function its possible frequencies. For electrons, similar values could be derived from spectrographs, which are the visual equivalents of the tones we hear from vibrating strings. A brilliant idea— the problem remained, however, that the mathematics that resulted from inserting the highly complex frequencies into the existing equations were simply incomprehensible. To top it all, pollen season had arrived in full force in Göttingen, and the allergy-p rone Heisenberg could barely breathe, so red and swollen was his face.

On June 7, Heisenberg left Göttingen to spend some time alone on a barren (and blessedly pollen- free) island in the North Sea called Heligoland. There he applied himself to the notoriously tricky math-

64

ematics of multiplying not individual values but the complex matrices of numbers needed to describe the before-a nd- after energy states of quantum measurements. Cleansed of his allergies by the sea air, Heisenberg worked feverishly day and night, performing herculean calculations. Unable to sleep one night on the island, he went to his desk and worked again, and the numbers started to click. At around three o’clock in the morning he saw the answers emerge. As he later recalled, “I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that I now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generously spread out before me.”34 As Born quickly realized upon Heisenberg’s return, in his search to model the strange behavior of the quanta, the young man had, entirely on his own, worked out a variation of linear algebra, at the time unknown to all but the most committed mathematicians.

Back in Göttingen, Born worked with Heisenberg and another physicist, Pascual Jordan, on what became known as “the three man paper,” which would lay out for the first time the matrix version of quantum mechanics. In their work they saw with wonderment that the laws of movement of classical mechanics could also be derived from the new matrix mechanics they were using to describe the strange world of quanta. At the same time, another mathematically minded physicist at Cambridge with whom Heisenberg had shared his paper, Paul Dirac, was also discovering this equivalence. In both cases the key to translating the physical laws of the visible world, known since Newton, into the enigmatic numbers of quantum mechanics came down to one number: Planck’s constant. Setting Planck’s constant to zero— and since it is already so ridiculously small, this is the practical consequence of any measurement of macroscopic movements— effectively removed the differences between the two. Just as Einstein had shown that the seeming consistency of space and time crumbles as one approaches one limit, the speed of light, Heisenberg had revealed that the seeming solidity of location and movement dissolved as humans approached another limit, this

65

one hidden deeper in the crevices of space and time than anyone had ever delved. Until now.

as heisenberg and the Göttingen team were putting the finishing touches on a new mechanics of discontinuity, another approach to understanding the movement of electrons was brewing. It began with a French aristocrat named Louis de Broglie whose fascination with physics lured him from the traditional family business of civil service. In 1925 he published a doctoral dissertation in which he proposed a mathematical equivalence between properties of matter and those of waves. Starting from Einstein’s demonstration that light waves also behaved like particles, de Broglie showed that electrons, previously regarded only as particles, could also behave like waves.35 Crucially, de Broglie’s formulas applied to all matter. The larger the mass of an object, the smaller the wavelength of its frequency— which means, for all practical intents, it’s not surprising that humans had never before encountered this strange aspect of things. According to his calculations, themselves emerging from Einstein’s work on photons, frequencies would become a factor only when an object’s mass was vanishingly small. Yet again, the standard of that size was Planck’s constant.

Key to de Broglie’s account was that it could also explain why electrons stayed confined to specific energy levels. By conceiving of orbits as waves of a given frequency undulating around a nucleus, de Broglie was able to show that the size of each electron shell was determined by the frequency of the wavelength associated with it. The sharp lines in the spectrographic data made sense in that only certain wavelengths could fit into orbits of specific radii without interfering with themselves. De Broglie sent his paper to Einstein, who immediately saw its implications for Heisenberg’s theory of discontinuity, commenting, “I believe that it involves more than a mere analogy.”36 Einstein, ever unhappy with the probabilistic implications of his own discoveries, thrilled to the potential evidence that

66

continuous, physical waves could constitute the reality underlying the discontinuities that the emerging quantum theory kept running into.

His enthusiasm infected another old-s chool physicist who read Einstein’s paper that year. Erwin Schrödinger was already an established scientist. Originally from Vienna, he had held a chair in physics at the University of Zurich for several years. A somewhat rakish bon vivant, Schrödinger was married and had several children, none of them from his wife.37 Rather less bohemian in his physics than in life, Schrödinger had followed the advances of Bohr and his team of wunderkinder with increasing alarm. Surely no one could take seriously the notion that electrons appeared and disappeared without occupying space and time in between their appearances. So, Einstein’s imprimatur on de Broglie’s idea was enough to send Schrödinger searching for answers. The formula he came up with in 1926 was received by physicists with a collective sigh of relief. Here were none of Heisenberg’s strange new ideas bundled into brain- racking matrix algebra. In its place Schrödinger had crafted an equation of elegant simplicity. Moreover, physicists could recognize it, because it measured things that occurred in reality, waves.

Right after publishing his new theory of “undulatory mechanics,” Schrödinger showed it to be translatable into Heisenberg’s matrix math, and soon thereafter Paul Dirac did the same thing.38 Perhaps Heisenberg’s mechanics weren’t so strange. Perhaps they were a needlessly abstruse version of something that had been hidden all along: a wavelike reality of fields underlying our world of solid objects in space and time. One that really existed and that followed classical mechanical laws, in which substances moved and changed in space and over time, and only appeared as discrete particles to our limited senses. Before Schrödinger’s equations Einstein had responded in dour terms to the direction quantum mechanics was taking, writing in a letter, “Heisenberg has laid a large quantum egg. In Göttingen they believe it (I don’t).”39 Now there seemed to be a way to avoid getting splattered by that egg.

67

The problem was, Schrödinger’s attempts to put physics back on the solid ground of classical mechanics by visualizing what happens within atoms in terms of physical waves were not panning out. He traveled to Copenhagen to try to work out his differences with Bohr in person, but the visit turned into a nightmare as the garrulous and meandering deep thinker poked and prodded at Schrödinger’s assumptions. Waves are waves in or of something, are they not? What is doing the “waving” in the case of electrons? And if waves are smooth, why do they register as particles when we measure them? As Planck had shown decades earlier, even the most recognized wavelike energy devolves into quanta when analyzed closely enough. A deeply discouraged Schrödinger would later say, “If we are going to stick to this damned quantum- jumping, then I regret that I ever had anything to do with quantum theory.”40

Schrödinger left Copenhagen in 1926 completely fed up with his skirmishes with Bohr. On the one hand, his contention that waves were real wasn’t holding water. On the other, it was by now generally accepted that his wave mechanics were equivalent to matrix mechanics and significantly wieldier. The wave equation worked, but what did it mean? Back in Göttingen, Max Born thought he had the answer. The waves in Schrödinger’s equations didn’t track the actual movement of real physical substance; like a data set plotted out on graph paper, they predicted the probability of where particles would be when they were eventually measured. Particles could move from point to point, and in large enough numbers their whereabouts could be accurately predicted, but any one particle at any given time could pop up pretty much anywhere.

Typically, Einstein had pointed the way when he interpreted the lines on spectrographs as corresponding to propensities of certain energy levels to radiate. But if this was the meaning of quantum mechanics, something dear to physicists would be lost for good. Scientists like Planck and Einstein had made good use of Boltzmann’s statistics, but for them it was always a heuristic. Whether with collisions of cue balls or gas molecules, they assumed that we needed

68

statistics because of technical limitations on our knowledge. If we could focus our gaze to the scale of gas molecules, we could predict their movements with the same precision we can for cue balls, and thus lower accordingly our reliance on statistical models.

At heart, physics was still deterministic. Actions led to reactions in totally law- abiding ways. With Born’s move to bring in probability, something changed decisively. As he wrote in his paper in 1926, in “quantum mechanics there exists no quantity in which an individual case determines the results of a collision. . . . I myself am inclined to give up determinism in the atomic world.”41 Einstein wasn’t having any of it. His response to Born has been quoted, requoted, and misquoted ad infinitum (often by the great man himself), but the gist was always the same. The imposing edifice of quantum mechanics “delivers much but it hardly brings us closer to the Old One’s secret. In any event, I am convinced that He is not playing dice.”42 The laws of physics couldn’t come down to maybes; things happened for a reason.

heisenberg introduced the idea of observation in the very first sentences of the paper that put the new physics into motion. “An attempt is made,” he wrote there, “to obtain foundations for quantum theoretical mechanics based exclusively on relationships between quantities that are in principle observable.”43 At first glance uncontroversial, in fact a revolution is already at work in this statement. Just as Einstein twenty years earlier had decided to let go of something everyone “knew”—t hat time was the same for everyone, that my “now” is the same as your “now”— Heisenberg was letting go of the image we have of a coherent reality that exists independently of our observations of it. If it had stayed at that level, though, Heisenberg’s pronouncement would have been little more than a version of the if-a - tree- falls riddle that stands in some people’s minds for philosophical profundity. Heisenberg’s paper, the math it contained, and the work to follow did something far more con-

69

sequential. They put forth a detailed scientific interpretation of experimental evidence that demonstrated the incoherence of that commonplace understanding of reality.

What is an observation? At its very minimum, any observation entails something connecting two disparate moments in time and space. As for Kant and Borges’s character Funes, a being who was truly, exclusively saturated in a present moment wouldn’t be able to observe anything at all. Observation, any observation, installs a minimal distance from what it observes, for the simple reason that for any observation to take place, one here and now must be related to another here and now, and that relation needs to be registered by some trace or connector between the two. Crucially, this aspect of observing doesn’t assume a conscious or otherwise human agent. It also doesn’t mean, as the popular misunderstanding of Heisenberg’s discovery would have it, that the tools we use to observe something always affect what we observe, although that too is true. Far more fundamentally, the blur of the instant of change that is a logical prerequisite for stitching together any two moments in space- time inextricably inheres in the very reality being observed. This, in a nutshell, is the uncertainty principle: you can know a particle’s position or its momentum, but you can’t know both.

In a deep sense, then, the laws of physics, the laws that describe how things behave, are really the laws of our observations of how things behave. Or, as Heisenberg would later say, “we have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning.”44 And since an observation is always an observation in time and space, the laws of physics regard operations in time and space. We may speculate about the world outside the conditions of time and space; indeed, as we will see in subsequent chapters, generations of thinkers and theologians have tried to do just that. But a nontemporal and nonspatial perspective obliterates the very idea of an observation, and hence is incompatible with any knowledge we can have of the world. In a fascinating and parallel way, the two constants that form the backbone of modern physics,

70

Einstein’s c and Planck’s h, turn out to be fundamental limits built into the fabric of our observed reality: on the one hand, a speed limit at which time comes to a standstill; on the other, a size limit on how closely we can focus on the warp and weft of space- time.

It was this second limit that Heisenberg unearthed, barely a year later, with a second revolutionary paper, one that would forever bind his name to the idea of an ineradicable uncertainty at the heart of our ability to know reality.






IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE

In the year 325 the Roman emperor Constantine called for an assembly of Christian bishops to gather in the town of Nicaea, now Iznik in modern- day Turkey. While it may seem arcane to many of us today, the theological question at hand was of burning importance to those in attendance. On one side of the room were ranged those who were convinced by the teachings of Arius, a presbyter from Egypt who held that God the Father should be understood as separate and hence superior to Jesus the Son, whom God had created and who in turn must have had an origin in time. Aligned against the Arians were the adherents of Eustathius, the bishop of Antioch, who countered that Jesus could not be secondary to God but must be understood as an equal and hence also eternal manifestation of God’s substance in human form. Such was the force of Eustathius’s arguments that the assembly of bishops voted almost unanimously to adopt this view and declare Arianism a heresy.1

Born some thirty years after the bishops met in Nicaea, Saint Augustine of Hippo adopted and codified the idea of Jesus’s full and equal participation in God’s divinity despite having been born,

120

lived, and died as a man.2 Indeed it was his nuanced interpretation that provided Augustine with the defense he needed against Arianism, since it allowed Jesus to be both human and divine, an incarnation in the temporal world of God’s unalterable eternity, the “mediator between you the One and us the many, who live in a multiplicity of distractions by many things.”3

What Saint Augustine was expounding was the mystery of the Incarnation, the theological centerpiece to Christianity, repeated each week since the early centuries of the church by its millions of adherents when they intone in unison that Christ is “true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father.”4 This Nicene Creed emerged from the conference called by Constantine in 325, but Augustine was drawn to it primarily because it solved (or at least encapsulated) for him the fundamental mystery of human existence. How do limited, temporal beings like us participate in the universal, eternal All that is God? We can do so only partially, he decided, because there is one who does so fully, one who is both man, and hence was born, lived, suffered, and died, and also divine, and hence embodies without any loss or difference the entirety of God’s universal being. Augustine had learned of this mystery by reading Plotinus.

Plotinus was born in the early years of the third century CE in Egypt, then an outpost of the Roman Empire. As a young man he studied the revitalized Greek philosophy flourishing at the time, but he had heard rumors of a great fount of wisdom in the East. Curious to learn more, he enlisted in the army of the emperor Gordian III and joined his doomed campaign to conquer Persia. Afterward he settled in Rome and quickly ascended the ranks of the capital’s most respected teachers. He followed a strict Pythagorean practice in his dress and eating habits, abjuring all meat, and his teachings took on a mystical, personalized flair.5

Of particular interest to Plotinus was the concept of eternity, which would prove so inspiring to Augustine. Plotinus didn’t conceive of eternity as an endless, boring extension of the present.

121 Instead, he imagined eternity as everything, all existence, all space, and all time, captured at once, in the blink of an eye. Eternity wasn’t the endless expansion of time; it was the absolute negation of time. We humans experience things in time because we are limited and cannot fully grasp the absolute unity of all things. The time we inhabit, he taught, is nothing but the moving image of eternity, an insignificant second hand sweeping over the face of a vast, immobile clock, never grasping more than a fraction of its surface. However, we could be certain that this eternity existed. For, as Kant would also see a millennium and a half later, our very ability to experience any given moment in time logically necessitates the existence of a reality that transcends those moments, a greater unity that “upholds things, that they not fall asunder.”6

Augustine turned Plotinus’s vision into a personal, existential quest. He called his life a “distension in several directions” and saw himself “scattered in times whose order” he didn’t understand.7 Christ’s incarnation of God’s total, all- encompassing being promised him the only path to salvation, a path that leads from the “storms of incoherent events” tearing to pieces the entrails of his soul, to “that day when, purified and molten by the fire of your love, I flow together to merge into you.”8 But for all its personal urgency, Augustine’s quest would become a universal touchstone, his idea of eternity the ultimate template for the desire that animates our fallen, temporal lives.

by early 1934, borges had sunk into the black bile of despair. His stories and poems from that time reek of death and are pockmarked with razor- sharp references to suicide. In one story, an actor receives a passionate onstage kiss from his beloved, only to be rebuffed in her dressing room— after which he offs himself. In another, a medical student suffering from feelings of inadequacy enters a pawnshop to purchase a revolver but deviates from his intent at the last moment, buying instead a phonograph with the money he would have spent

122

on ending his life.9

If the second story vaguely suggests art as a path to redemption, for Borges that path would stretch on for several more excruciating years, during which the solace of death never ceased to beckon. Yet thankfully, for posterity and the world of letters, he managed to resist temptation. And what kept him afloat, even if only barely, was a small, nagging problem. The problem of eternity.

Granted this problem wasn’t new. (How could it be?) Borges had obsessed about infinite time already in the 1920s in essays like the one on Achilles and the tortoise, or the one titled “The Duration of Hell.” In these cases and others, he grappled with the idea of eternity as the endlessness of time, be it internally, as one chops it into ever smaller pieces, or externally, in the hell of quite literally one damned thing after another. Each of these visions tormented him with the afterimage of a lost love, ever receding in the drift of time. With his new thoughts on eternity, however, Borges added another dimension to his approach. He started rereading Plotinus.

His daily life shrouded in the misery of depression, Borges fell hard for the gravitational pull of Plotinus’s vision of eternity. This was not the bad infinity of one day of suffering after another (after another . . .) that plagued his contemplation of the duration of hell; nor was it the obliteration of the self that he saw as somehow worse. Here beckoned a vision of utter plenitude, simultaneously grasped, with no toll paid to the ravages of time. Here was Perfection. Here was Bliss. And yet Borges could still not find a satisfactory explanation for how we participate in the eternal if, as Plotinus had put it, humans are always in time.10 There could be only one answer. Something in us escapes the temporal, even as we inhabit that realm.

It was this something that Borges glimpsed as he paged through his worn copy of Plotinus. To be human, Borges saw, is to straddle the impossible border between ephemerality and eternity, loss and permanence. From the vantage of a sifting, vanishing time we project an eternity hopelessly out of reach. Like the exile who, “with a melting heart,” recalls “expectations of happiness,” we “gather up all

123

the delights of a given past in a single image.”11 Eternity is nostalgia, the inextinguishable desire for what we’ve lost.12

Not everything was doom and gloom, though. In 1932, Borges had met a writer some fifteen years his junior by the name of Adolfo Bioy Casares. They were introduced to each other at a luncheon hosted by the writer and socialite Victoria Ocampo, to whose great exasperation the two men promptly withdrew from the other guests and fell into deep private conversation about, naturally, books. When she urged them not to be “such shits” and to come back and talk to her guests, they opted to leave instead so they could continue their conversation un- harangued.13

Unlike Borges, who couldn’t have been more of a city slicker, Bioy was a scion of the landed gentry. He was studying law in Buenos Aires when they met but soon ditched his studies— ostensibly to dedicate himself to his family’s lands, but really to free himself for a pursuit much closer to his heart: reading and writing. A few years after bailing on Ocampo’s luncheon, Bioy invited Borges to stay with him at his estancia not far from the city. Borges did his best to adapt to the environs, going so far as to claim he knew how to ride— a fiction soon debunked by his propensity to slide off the far side of every horse he tried to mount.14

Shortly after Borges’s strange little book A History of Eternity appeared to bewildered reviews in 1936, Bioy became one of the few people to purchase it. In addition to the essay on Plotinus, another on Nietzsche’s concept of the eternal return, and a discussion of competing translations of the One Thousand and One Nights, Borges had included a brief review of two versions of an obscure Indian novel. Bioy was so captivated by Borges’s review that he ordered the novel from a bookseller in London, only to learn that it didn’t exist. Bioy had become one of the first to fall for what would become a standard Borgesian trick—i nserting fictions into the real world in the form of obscure footnotes, invented references, or seemingly scholarly studies of concocted writers.

The little review that so confused Bioy dealt with a novel called

124

The Approach to Al- Mu’tasim, ostensibly authored by a Bombay- based attorney named Mir Bahadur Ali. The novel first appeared in 1932 in an edition so cheap “its paper was virtually newsprint,” with promotional copy touting it as the first detective novel written by a Bombay native. Accolades in the local press spurred Bahadur Ali to release an updated, illustrated edition in 1934. This is the one that was then purportedly reprinted in London “with a foreword by Dorothy L. Sayers, but with the (perhaps merciful) omission of the illustrations”15— the version, of course, that Bioy unsuccessfully attempted to track down.

The (nonexistent) novel tells the story of a law student who falls in with the worst kind of people, men who seem not to possess the slightest spark of decency. Amid such ethical squalor, the student one day witnesses a single act of kindness, a “moment of tenderness . . . in one of the most abominable men.” Thunderstruck, the student hypothesizes that he must be seeing in this roughneck a trace of goodness left by another person— a friend the man once had, one who perhaps had been likewise imprinted by another friend before him— and he comes to the conclusion that “somewhere in the world there is a man from whom this clarity, this brightness, emanates.”16 The student follows the traces from person to person until he at last arrives at the store of a modest bookseller in Persia, at the back of which a glowing light emanates from behind a tawdry curtain. The student calls out the name he has since learned, Al- Mu’tasim; a voice bids him enter and the novel ends.

The idea of being thunderstruck by an unexpected act of decency recalls something Kant once wrote about the call of duty. What astonished Kant about the moral law was how it ensured that humans would always be more than mere servants to their base desires, more than cogs in the giant machine of nature, blown every which way by the fluctuations of time and place. We see evidence for the existence of this moral law everywhere, he said; in the least impressive of our fellows, in the most abominable of men, we can at times glimpse an act of righteousness, a spark of goodness. And

125

when we do, Kant wrote, we can feel our spirit bow down in respect, even if we wish to resist that feeling and remain aloof.17

Like Kant, the student in Bahadur Ali’s book witnesses an unexpected act of goodness and feels his spirit bow down. But then he does more. Instead of recognizing there the influence of a universal moral law, he decides the goodness must have a specific source, an embodiment. One person who incarnates all that goodness, all that selflessness. One person who has left his trace on others, a trace the student must follow. An incarnation of goodness in a fallen world.

In this fragmentary, cryptic story the first bloom emerged of a radical new style nourished by the loam of ancient thought: a work of fiction disguised as a review or scholarly article, replete with footnotes mixing real and imagined sources, all in the service of excavating some mysterious source. The mystery ignites a quest, a search for some being, place, book, or poem that incarnates a unity we yearn for but can never achieve— eternity, as Borges put it, in the style of desire.

Astonishingly, inevitably, what we see emerge here is the same insight Kant fell upon as he sought to unify his system in the years leading up to his Critique: that the very idea of temporal and spatial diversity requires us to posit an ultimate unity that can never itself be the subject of our experience, but one we nonetheless endow with reality and incarnate as the object of our deepest desire. For Kant that object of desire was both the motor of science and what reason needs to guard against, lest we ever believe we’ve found it. For Borges that object is the motor of literature, indeed of life, and yet, in story after story, he always sounds a note of caution. For as Borges would learn, to find that object, to enter that ultimate reality, is something no temporal being could ever survive.

when borges was thirteen years old, his father, Jorge Guillermo Borges, published a trio of poems under the common title “Momentos.” In them, the disillusioned lawyer whose mother had emigrated

126

from England lamented the passing of time, the loss of those moments of love and ecstasy that we yearn for but that then pass in the blink of an eye, only to be looked back on in regret and longing.18 Perhaps under the influence of a midlife crisis, perhaps wishing to rekindle his romance with his wife, Leonor Acevedo, Jorge Guillermo decided to move his family to Europe, eventually to live in the country of his mother’s family. The first stop, however, would be Geneva, Switzerland. There the couple’s two children, Jorge Luis and his sister (who happened to be named Norah), could stay safely under the care of Leonor’s mother, while the grown-u ps toured the capitals of Europe in search of lost time.

World history upset these best- laid plans. War broke out while the lovebirds toured Germany, so they rushed back to neutral Switzerland and enrolled Jorge Luis in the school founded by John Calvin. They apparently didn’t think this a necessary step for Norah, who took painting lessons at home and would eventually enter the École des Beaux- Arts.19 Unlike Norah, who learned to love Geneva and whose French became so fluent she would start inserting French words into their conversations at home, Georgie didn’t thrive. Even back in Argentina, speaking his own language, he had been mercilessly bullied and usually kept to himself. Now with the additional barrier of a language he didn’t know and didn’t show much aptitude for, he became even more isolated.

While not much better at German, he did develop more of a taste for it and fell under the spell of Arthur Schopenhauer, of whom he would write, “If the riddle of the universe can be stated in words, I think these words would be in his writing.”20 Desiring to learn to read in this new language, he chose as one of the texts Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. Another was the Viennese writer Gustav Meyrink’s novel Der Golem, about a Czech rabbi who tries to create life and produces a monster instead. Understanding the mystical creation of life itself proved an easier lift than reading Kant. The Golem ended up being the first book in German that Borges managed to read in its entirety, and it landed on fertile ground.

127

Around this time, he made his first friends, two Jewish boys, Maurice Abramowicz and Simon Jichlinski, both of whom shared Borges’s love of literature and ideas. Now seventeen, he began to liberate himself from the confines of his family life, staying out late with his friends, caught up in rapt conversations.21 It’s possible that his great affinity for Jewish culture dates to these early friendships. Indeed, Borges would later develop a passing familiarity with Jewish mysticism, specifically with the writings of the Jewish philosopher Gershom Scholem, whom he knew personally and named twice in a poem inspired by Meyrink’s novel (although he impishly claimed to have used the philosopher’s name only because he couldn’t come up with any other word that rhymed with “golem”).22

According to Hassidic lore, the method for animating a golem involved inscribing the Hebrew word for truth, emet, into the creature’s forehead. Because the creature should be destroyed immediately upon creation, this would be done by erasing the first letter, leaving behind met, or death. The letter to be erased, and hence the very breath of life, was the first letter of the alphabet, aleph.23 In Borges’s poem the rabbi eyes his monstrous creation with a mixture of tenderness and horror, and asks himself, “Why did I decide to add to the infinite series yet another symbol? Why to the vain skein that unravels in the eternal did I add another cause, another effect, another care?”24 This tension between the eternal and the temporal world of causes and effect is the same one that emerged in Borges’s review of Bahadur’s apocryphal novel. And in that story’s last line, Borges pointed to another tradition as a precursor to this idea, the same tradition he discussed in a short piece he wrote around the same time called “A Defense of the Kabbalah.”

Kabbalah refers to the practice of rabbinical interpretations that posited the Torah scrolls as shadows or copies of an eternal Torah written in fire. Kabbalists reasoned that, unlike the letters we human must contend with, scattered in times whose order we don’t understand, those of the original and eternal Torah are not subject to the contingencies of space and time. Attempting to reconstruct that

128

original timeless text, the kabbalists parsed the Torah through allegorical readings, numerology, and anagrams.25 The Sefer Yetzirah, or Book of Creation, taught that the twenty-t wo letters of the Hebrew alphabet were God’s building blocks, which God combined to come up with the complexity and variety of existence, starting with the first letter: “Aleph with all and all with Aleph; Beth with all and all with Beth; and so each in turn. . . . [A]ll creation and all language come from one name.”26 Our languages, fallen far from their divine source, still carry those traces of divine inspiration; the older and more sacred a language, the closer it comes to that source. Thus, in the first phoneme of the first Hebrew letter, aleph, the kabbalists found the very power of naming, of creating, of engendering life itself.27

While the time in Geneva lasted longer than Jorge Guillermo had intended, it would eventually come to an end. Typically, this happened only once Georgie had finally grown a taste for it. Along with friends, he had also found love. Emilie, of green eyes and flowing red hair, a first and chaste romance that would cast the mold for a future, more devastating infatuation. His domineering mother, Leonor, foreshadowing future impediments, did not approve. The girl was working class. Borges’s father, who once thought sending his bookish son to school with a dagger would solve his severe bullying problem, this time decided the boy should take someone to bed. He gave Georgie an address in the red- light district and pushed him out the door. The young man dutifully followed his father’s instructions, but his anxiety mounted as he neared his goal. Not terribly confident even under normal circumstances, Georgie failed to perform. Traumatized, mortified, he went for a medical consultation and was diagnosed with a weak liver. His father decided it was time to leave Geneva, and Emilie, for climes that could warm up his son’s tepid blood. Thus did Borges experience his first great heartbreak.28

Time is loss. Time is heartbreak. Time is desire for timelessness. Almost thirty years later, in the wake of a more momentous affair, Borges would bring this concatenation of influences and ideas

129

together in a story that would become the eponymous tale in one of his most successful books and a story that for many readers around the world would come to exemplify his unique literary vision. In that story he imagined a villa in Buenos Aires where a mysterious object lay hidden under the cellar stairs. A disk only a few centimeters in diameter, containing within it all the space of the cosmos

“with no diminution of size.”29

Fittingly, he called that object an Aleph.

in “the aleph,” borges’s alter ego comes across (perhaps all too accurately in some respects) as a snobbish wet blanket of a man, haunting the villa and family of his departed beloved, Beatriz Viterbo. The villa, now inhabited by her poet cousin Carlos Argentino Daneri, has become Beatriz’s de facto mausoleum. But the price he pays for the license reluctantly given to him to visit is having to read, and worse react to, Carlos Argentino’s atrocious poetry. It turns out the man has nothing less in his sights than a poetic compendium, in almost no discernible order, of everything in existence. At the time of Borges’s telling, he has put into verse such sundry climes as a stretch of the Ob River, a gas refinery in Veracruz, several hectares of land in Queensland, “and a Turkish bath not far from the famed Brighton Aquarium.”30

Carlos Argentino’s production of peripatetic poetry comes to a screeching halt when he calls the character Borges in a panic to tell him that his house is slated to be demolished by the property owners. While Borges begins to protest in horror at the loss of this shrine to Beatriz, Carlos Argentino praters on, bemoaning that the destruction of the house will make it impossible to write his poem. This is because, he clarifies to Borges, in one corner of the cellar there is an

Aleph, “one of the points in space that contain all points.”31

Borges’s confusion quickly morphs into the suspicion that Carlos Argentino must be mad, which doesn’t stop him from heading over to the villa to witness his psychotic breakdown in person. It is

130

only after making his way down the darkened stairs and lying on the cellar floor at Carlos Argentino’s bidding that he realizes his folly, that he has allowed himself to be “locked underground by a madman, after first drinking down a snifter of poison.”32 He closes his eyes for a moment, and the thought swiftly departs when he opens them and sees the Aleph.

At this point, he says, his telling of the tale runs into an irresolvable roadblock, “the enumeration, even partial enumeration, of infinity.”33 The Aleph, he writes, “was probably two or three centimeters in diameter, but universal space was contained inside it, with no diminution in size. Each thing (the glass surface of a mirror, let us say) was infinite things, because I could clearly see it from every point in the cosmos.”34

Here follows one of the most captivating poetic lists in literary history, as Borges attempts what he has already declared impossible, namely, to enumerate the infinite. He details an extraordinary panoply of random moments and experiences, memories and perspectives, writing,

I . . . saw a silvery spiderweb at the center of a black pyramid, . . . saw convex equatorial deserts and their every grain of sand, . . . saw a copy of the first English translation of Pliny (Philemon Holland’s), saw every letter of every page at once . . . , saw tigers, pistons, bisons, tides, and armies, saw all the ants on earth, . . . saw the horrendous remains of what had once, deliciously, been Beatriz Viterbo, saw the circulation of my dark blood, . . . saw the Aleph from everywhere at once, saw the earth in the Aleph, and the Aleph once more in the earth and the earth in the Aleph, saw my face and my viscera, saw your face, and I felt dizzy, and I wept, because my eyes had seen that secret, hypothetical object whose name has been usurped by men but which no man has ever truly looked upon: the inconceivable universe.35

This existence of everything, in the blink of an eye. The incon-

131

ceivable universe, out there, at this very instant. Here, in one extraordinary run- on sentence, Borges managed to encapsulate a philosophical insight that catapulted him from the intimacy of love and loss to the edges of the knowable universe. This insight had coursed through the hidden veins of culture and science from Plato through Jewish mysticism to Christian revelation, from the Critique of Kant that he had read as a child to learn German to the very principle that Werner Heisenberg had unleashed contemporaneously with Borges’s own brief moment of happiness, the flow of an afternoon in life that he had hoped to capture and transmute into eternity.

This is the insight that the Aleph expressed. To have a self, to experience anything at all, required the existence of the vast totality of space around him, of a past preceding him and a future yet to come. And yet that secret, hypothetical object, the inconceivable universe, was destined to remain hypothetical, secret, forever.

at a party hosted by Bioy in the winter of 1944, Borges met Estela Canto.36 A journalist who was enjoying a rising reputation as a writer, Estela appreciated Borges’s work but was unimpressed by his frumpy appearance, not to mention his apparent lack of interest in her. This changed when they met by chance on their way to another evening gathering at Bioy’s house, and Borges suggested they walk together for a few blocks. The walk ended up taking several hours and led to a drink at a local bar. At one point in their conversation Estela quoted Bernard Shaw in English. This clearly caught Borges’s attention, for she later recalled he mentioned specifically that it was the first time he had “come across a woman who likes Bernard

Shaw.”37

The two began to meet occasionally to stroll the city’s streets. It was on one of these walks that Borges confided to Estela that he was at work on a story about “a place that contained all other places in the world.”38 On another occasion he showed up unannounced at

132

her apartment with a gift. It was, he told her, an Aleph, and it would show her “all the objects in the world.” When she undid the wrapping, all she found was a kaleidoscope. Her confusion did nothing to dampen his enthusiasm, however, and he babbled on about how he planned to make the story he was working on the first of many he would dedicate to her.39

Borges soon became fixated on the idea of Estela as his version of Dante’s Beatrice, the girl the poet fell in love with, who died young and would reappear in his Divine Comedy to lead the poet from the depths of the inferno to the apotheosis of God’s paradise. In that association he was certainly helped along by her name. Estela is a name derived from Latin and old French meaning star. Each volume of the Divine Comedy ends with the same words, le stelle, the stars. The theme reached its climax in March 1945, when Borges invited Estela on an outing to a town just to the south of the capital where he had summered with his family as a child and spent a few, rare happy moments. Specifically, he wanted to take her to an inn, the Hotel Las Delicias. The inn had seen better days. As Estela would later recall, “The dining room, vast and badly lit, was almost empty. The food on the fixed- price menu was as bad as might be expected in a boardinghouse.” Still, she noted, none of this seemed to bother him, and “he was happy and excited in this old dining room, which had been robbed of its former splendor.”40

As they ate the mediocre fare and then later made their way across the equally shabby grounds, Borges cited passages from Dante’s Paradiso in which Beatrice guides the poet to the mystic rose at the heart of God’s eternal heaven, “which holds / the center still and moves all else around it.”41 In that vision, Dante described looking up at the center of all creation, where he “saw a point that sent forth so acute / a light, that anyone who faced the force / with which it blazed would have to shut his eyes, / and any star that, seen from earth, would seem / to be the smallest, set beside that point, as star conjoined with star, would seem a moon.”42 Reveling in the ecstasy of Dante’s ethereal lines, Borges dropped to his knees and popped

133

the question.

“I’d be very happy to, Georgie,” Estela replied, “but don’t forget that I’m a disciple of Bernard Shaw. We cannot get married without first going to bed with each other.”43

While Borges at first took Estela’s answer to be an affirmation, he apparently found it difficult to deliver the goods. His mode of courtship soon devolved into inviting Estela to tea at the home he shared with his mother, whose snobbery irritated Estela mercilessly. In the end, she would blame the old dame’s behavior and Borges’s cloying attachment to her for having “destroyed any possibility” of their relationship developing further.44 In the meantime, though, Estela’s presence in his life had given enough wings to his imagination for him to finally produce a successful story collection titled The Aleph.

at the outset of his essay on eternity, Borges made a passing, almost unnoticeable mention of something that had occurred some two decades earlier in a patent office in Bern, Switzerland. From that office burst a “relativist scare” that brought to light the problem of “synchronizing each person’s individual time with the general time of mathematicians.”45 Indeed, one of the most profound of Einstein’s discoveries in 1905 had been that our common notion of universal time had no basis in reality. This notion, codified by Newton in the image of God’s clock ticking away behind all human perceptions and actions, seems, at first glance, an obvious assumption to make about reality: namely, that it exists, “out there,” as a vast, simultaneous now. For each of us, this vast now consists of the form of the mental _resources/books//The Rigor of Angels_ Borges Heisenberg K - William Egginton we make of whatever else is happening in the world right now, at this very moment. My children asleep upstairs as I write these words; my friend in Boston making his morning coffee; my wife in Austria already up and about in the city; the Perseverance rover making its way across the surface of Mars; the James Webb Space Telescope training its mirrors on the origins of space and time. The problem is that vast now can only ever be a men-

134

tal construction. That’s because information, all information, takes time to travel. So, if I could look up through the ceiling to my kids, the information that they are sleeping would take some (admittedly, absurdly short) time to reach me. If my friend in Boston were to FaceTime with me while making his coffee, my experience would be imperceptibly delayed; slightly more for my wife in Austria. At 1.5 million kilometers away, the JWST would send emissions subjected to a noticeable lag. For its part the poor rover’s rovings could take more than twenty minutes to arrive at my computer screen, depending on where Earth and Mars were in their orbits.

So, this vast present moment extends around us like an almost infinitely wide and infinitely thin disk of space- time and we just can’t see it, right? Not exactly. While in the classical Newtonian view of the cosmos it makes sense to talk about a stable reality being shared right now throughout space, Einstein showed that this idea really depended on our ability to measure time and compare those measurements with one another. And this, of course, requires sending messages back and forth. Thus, it makes no sense to ask whether events are indeed happening at the same time or if they in fact happened at successive times until we measure them and communicate those measurements. But since measuring and comparing take time, not only can deciding if events were simultaneous only occur at a later time, whether they were in fact simultaneous will also change if one or both of the parties doing the measuring are in motion with respect to the other.46 In other words, it turns out that there is no stable reality coinciding with what we imagine the present moment, out there in space, to be. Like Heisenberg’s electron, it doesn’t exist until we observe it.

And still, we imagine it. Like the Aleph below the stairs, we project the vast, inconceivable universe outward in space with every thought and every observation we make, just as we require a past from which we stem and a future toward which we hope. Such projections aren’t arbitrary; they are implied by the most minimal experience. Yet to treat them as though they existed in that form on their

135

own, outside our experience, is to treat our image of the universe, which contains all space and time, as if it were something in space and time. To treat it, in other words, as if it were real.

It isn’t. And yet the dream of its reality has captivated the world from time immemorial and continues to hold us in its spell today.

From the darkened streets of his memories of loss, as he gazed hopefully onto vistas of new promise, Borges made out the contours of a poetic, scientific, and philosophical vision that had the power to shatter that spell. It was a vision that would unite physics and ethics in a strange, new architecture of the cosmos and an ultimate vindication of human freedom. But before reaching that point, Borges would follow that vision into a new antinomy, to the very paradoxical edge of a boundless universe, a universe he could start to glimpse from the twilight of his advancing blindness and the intricate passageways of a seemingly infinite library.






MADE TO MEASURE

By turning their gazes toward the deepest recesses of the past to understand the very origins of existence, cosmologists opened a Pandora’s box of philosophical enigmas. Among these, one stands out: had the fundamental laws of nature diverged from their actual values by even vanishingly small degrees, the universe would not have evolved to sustain any kind of life resembling our own. In short, the cosmos appears made to measure, constructed with the purpose of producing beings like us who can in turn measure it, study its mysteries, and ask fundamental questions about their own origins.

The enigma of the improbability of human existence started to arise not long after it became clear that the universe expands and hence must have had a starting point in time. Already in 1951 the astronomer Fred Hoyle established that the forces holding together atomic nuclei had to be within a thousandth of their actual value for oxygen and carbon to be produced at the levels needed to sustain life.1 In 1999 cosmologists discovered that if the early universe had been more homogeneous, galaxies and hence stars and planets

187

might never have formed, but if it had been less homogeneous, with more prominent ripples of energy and matter, the resulting universe would have turned out so clumpy that today it would consist mostly of black holes— not the most hospitable home for life as we know it.

Another of the “dials” that had to be precisely set if life were to eventually emerge showed up when Einstein used general relativity to describe the whole of the universe. As we saw before, to ensure that a four- dimensional space- time sphere remained stable over time, as he believed any self- respecting universe must do, he slipped an extra number into his calculations, which he later regretted. And yet, years later, scientists discovered a mysterious force pushing the expansion of the universe that clocks in at just about the value that Einstein came up with—a little too large and the universe curves back into itself and crunches together; a little too small and it curves out from itself and tears itself apart.2

Estimates of the degree of fine- tuning the laws of nature must have had vary enormously, depending on what result one hopes to explain. Whereas a run- of- the- mill, could- sustain- some- kind- of- existence universe might cost us an improbability of one in a thousand or so, a made- to- order cosmos within shouting distance of our own comes with a price tag so steep that its zeros would outnumber all the atoms in the universe.3

The philosophical problem that emerged from the realization that our very existence as sentient beings owes a great deal to chance has led some scientists to what they call the anthropic principle. This principle takes two forms: a “weak” one that scientists often accept as likely true but not particularly mind- blowing as revelations go; and a “strong” one that comes across to most scientists like a lot of hocus- pocus. The strong anthropic principle also goes by the name of “design”— as in, to explain how something as wildly improbable as intelligent life emerged from such a potentially inhospitable set of possibilities requires us to presume that a being of vast power and intelligence planned it that way. The weak anthropic principle, in contrast, simply concedes that, as improbable as it may seem that

188

the universe emerged to support intelligent life, it would be more improbable for life to find itself living in a universe that didn’t support it.

While most scientists tend to harbor distaste for obviously metaphysical solutions such as presented by the strong anthropic principle, one cosmological theory that emerges from the weak principle has garnered some interest. This theory, known as the multiverse, posits that all possible universes in fact exist, and that our own is one in an innumerable set of universes of infinitely different sizes, shapes, and durations, each with its own set of laws and constants. If this were true, supporters say, it would solve the problem of the improbability of a life-s upporting cosmos. As one proponent of this theory describes it, if you walked into a clothing store with only one suit on its racks, and it happened to fit, you would be rightfully surprised. If you walked into a store whose racks teemed with suits and one happened to fit, this would be considerably less surprising. The multiverse theory effectively turns a one-s uit store into an infinite- suits store.4

Whether in its strong or weak versions, finding a suit that fits is a telling metaphor for the anthropic principle. The improbability of the laws of nature that would support our existence seems incommensurable with the fact of our existence. We feel a need to resolve this tension, to explain how such improbable laws came about. So, like Sherlock Holmes we investigate and come up with a series of explanations. We desire to find the answer to the mystery, but we also desire it to end in a certain way; namely, we want to learn something new, but also something that makes sense, that fits into what we already know.

To find that the initial settings of the universe are a random set of numbers that could just as easily have been different seems clunky, infelicitous, something like plowing through a mystery novel, only to find out that the murderer is some random character we haven’t even encountered yet. We yearn for a more aesthetically satisfying, even beautiful, answer. The anthropic principle in both its versions

189

seeks to respond to that yearning by showing us as an inevitable outcome of the initial settings. Either infinite universes exist and our own existence selects for the conditions that support us, or a single universe was created with purpose to sustain life. To put it another way, either we take an idea, namely, the mathematical models we have arrived at to explain the universe, and grant it the privilege of really existing in the form of the multiverse, or we elevate actual reality to the level of the ultimate idea, namely, God’s plan.

The belief in some element of design or intention in the formation of the universe has had a long history. The medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas deduced from the evidently ordered nature of the world that “there is some intelligent being by whom everything in nature is directed to a goal, and this we call ‘God.’ ”5 The key to Aquinas’s deduction is the notion of purpose. Either things happen without a purpose and hence occur by random chance, he reasoned, or they are guided toward an end. Since it is evident that something as extraordinary as life, and human life to boot, could hardly come about by the random meanderings of blind chance, it follows that the universe has purpose, namely, the creation and sustenance of human life.

The idea of purpose extends beyond the simple attribution of the rigor we find in nature to a divine mind. In Kant’s time, it had become a philosophical commonplace to read the evidence coming from organic life as a sign of a kind of causality that transcended the merely mechanical. To a degree, Kant accepted these arguments. As he reasoned in the last of his great works, whereas the various parts of a watch are affect ed by encountering one another and imparting motion, organic matter, such as the seed that takes nourishment from the earth and sun and turns it with time into a tremendous oak, exhibits an entirely different kind of causal power.6 As the seed develops, Kant reasoned, the intricate causal links from cell to cell, moment to moment of its growth, appear to be guided by the idea of what the seed always had to be.

In Kant’s time, the kind of extra causality he attributed to organic 190 matter was widely thought to be at work in the world in general. Leibniz’s thought, somewhat simplified and perhaps even degraded under the enormous influence of Christian Wolff’s teaching, had its followers looking for an ultimate purpose pretty much everywhere. Sunlight, Wolff had proclaimed, exhibits purpose because with it “we can conveniently carry on our duties, which cannot be done in the evening at all, or at least not so handily and with difficulties.”7 For confirmation biases of this magnitude, Kant had little more than scorn. Indeed, he liked to respond by citing Voltaire’s famous lampoon of Leibniz in his play Candide, whose titular character would claim with a straight face that God had obviously given men noses so as better to hold up their spectacles.8

Kant knew he was walking a fine line, on the one hand ridiculing the most obvious examples of imputing intelligent design to nature while, on the other, holding out the possibility of some other causality at work than the strictly mechanistic. What this other causality might be and how to understand its relation to the necessity of mechanistic causality would become the centerpiece of his last great work. It was in this book, which was ultimately about artistic creation as much as our understanding of the natural world, that Kant worked out the solution to a mystery that unites science and the arts, the mystery of what guided a genius like Einstein as he teased an explanation for gravity out of the subtle geometry of space and time, or one like Heisenberg when, in the dark of night on the windswept island of Heligoland, he saw spread before him the mathematics of nature in all its splendor. For as much as their discoveries differed, one and the same lodestar led both scientists to their insights. They knew their theories to be right because they perceived them to be beautiful.9

what makes an object, a person, an experience, beautiful? The ancients long had an answer for this question. Unless we resign ourselves to a concept of aesthetic appreciation as the mere expression

191

of fleeting and meaningless pleasures, the perception of beauty must indicate a more noble, unchanging idea underlying it. For Plato, just as a person’s beauty indicated the presence of a good and wise soul, the harmony of nature and the harmony of mathematics were signs that, in its transience, the physical world expressed permanent and perfect ideas that guide and form it. This was also the position of the rationalist philosophers who believed that the natural world expressed God’s preestablished harmony, and it was the position that dominated Germany when, as he was wont to do, Immanuel Kant decided to step in.

In the spring of 1786, Kant was at the height of his intellectual powers. He had also become the academic equivalent of a rock star. Already a third book dedicated to his philosophy would appear that year; across Germany, university courses about his work were popping up; and the older generation’s best- known philosopher, Moses Mendelssohn, had just laid on Kant the epithet of “all- crushing.”10 Perhaps most tellingly, people had started to wonder if Kant’s philosophy just might be dangerous. A rumor quickly spread that his famously difficult writing had driven at least one student insane, and a popular psychologist inveighed against the study of Kant’s writings, warning that they could “deaden the love of true learning” and “draw the attention away from the concerns of human life as well as from the works of art and nature which warm the heart and heighten the imagination.” Reading Kant and his ilk, he grumbled, would “unsettle the powers of the understanding, spoil good principles, and poison the source of human happiness.” Such sensationalism aside, Kant’s writing might indeed have led to at least some risky behavior. At the University of Jena, one student insinuated that a colleague who had dared to make a comment about Kant would need thirty years of study to understand the thinker. For good measure he then added that thirty more would be in order before the fellow should open his mouth on the subject. Naturally, a duel ensued.11

Between engaging in debates, fending off critical reviews, and

192

finishing the second edition of his masterwork, not to mention serving as rector of the university, Kant had his hands full. Yet his heart was not in it. For a large portion of his time had become absorbed by the waning health of his best friend, Joseph Green. Each afternoon he went to sit next to Green’s sickbed, staying beside his ailing friend until the hour he would have left his house had they dined together. This lasted until the day of Green’s death on June 27. Kant was devasted. From that moment he ceased to socialize in restaurants and cafés, and his social circles shrank. He would continue to visit a few friends in their homes, but for most of his meals Kant began to employ a cook and eat at home.12

The following year Kant decided to institutionalize this practice. So, with another friend and former student, Christian Jacob Kraus, he established a dining club that would regularly meet in his house. The ritual started slowly. On Easter Day 1787, Hamann went with his children to call on Kraus at his house, where they were told they could find him at Kant’s house. When they arrived, they “found the two bachelors in a cold room, completely frozen.”13 Delighted to see them, Kant had some fine wine brought in, and the day brightened considerably.14 From these inauspicious embers a crackling social fire grew. Many of the most prominent citizens of Königsberg would gather for meals at Kant’s house, and many more would number among those visitors to the town who came to pay their respects to the great philosopher, only to end up, pleasantly surprised, sitting at his table.

Kant enjoyed these dinners immensely and would eagerly await the hour of his guests’ arrival. Once the meal had started, he relished the role of host, personally handing out silverware and enchanting his guests with amusing patter. The meals materialized as if the order of the dishes were determined by an ethical maxim (in Kant’s mind they likely were): “Only three dishes, but excellently prepared and very tasty, two bottles of wine, and when in season there was fruit and dessert.”15 If guests tried to say grace before dinner, Kant would cut them off, evincing an impatience with religiosity that

193

would increasingly threaten to alienate him from the legal authorities. He would also interrupt and change the subject if diners of a philosophical inclination tried to talk shop. But he would happily dish out the juicy political gossip of the day alongside the tender roast he served with the best English mustard. The core group that attended these dinners became Kant’s lifeline. By the time he died some seventeen years later, the two dozen or so who remained from this circle of dining friends would carry his coffin.16

Seventeen eighty- seven was also the year Kant published the second edition of his Critique of Pure Reason. He had put the time and effort into this task because he felt it necessary to clarify and, in some cases, modify his claims, but now he was eager to get on to his next project. As he wrote to a correspondent in June of that year, he needed to avoid taking on any further reviews or engaging in more debates about his prior work so he could devote his attention to bringing out a “Critique of the Foundations of Taste.”

Applying his critical method to questions of aesthetic appreciation was not incidental. Kant saw in our ability to have rational discussions about beauty a linchpin without which his entire system would remain unstable. In the first Critique, Kant had shown that the condition of possibility of our perceiving anything at all was our innate ability to translate an otherwise bewildering chaos of sensory input into ordered events in space and time whose causal relations could be objectively established. Such objectivity in turn required the presumption of a total unity of the physical world, a mechanistic chain of causality from past to future, just as our ability to stitch disparate moments in time together depended on the presumption of a unified seat of consciousness. Crucially, Kant realized that we must presuppose such unity even though we can never verify it in our experience— never see the universe as a coherent object in space and time; never see the self on its own, apart from the flow of experiences it sutures together. Similarly, Kant now realized, whenever we connect two or more specific claims as being examples of a more general truth, of an idea that contains them both, the very coherence

194

of our judgments requires us to assume a web of connections that links each specific instance to the whole of creation, even though that whole can never itself be an object of our experience.

Here, Kant said, lay the harmony that the ancients had identified as the source of beauty. For when we perceive the chaos of data we receive about the world to be connected by an underlying unifying idea, we find that amalgam to be beautiful, harmonious, complete on its own. Our desire to explain further is disarmed, and we find ourselves enraptured in contemplating a scene that requires nothing more of us, something for which we need to supply no external purpose because it carries its purpose entirely in itself. This is a feeling Kant believed we experienced in the presence of great art. As the conductor Marin Alsop once said about a symphony of Gustav Mahler’s, every note is there for a reason.17 Each of its elements is situated exactly right and couldn’t be elsewhere, hence the piece seems necessary, inevitable, yet in no way could we have come upon it on our own, in which case it would give us the sense of being hackneyed, clichéd.

Ancient philosophers were thus right in believing that we are attracted to and find beautiful those common principles that we discover underlying and unifying the bewildering diversity of nature. When Plato argued that we feel joy or pleasure upon discovering a mathematical rule expressed in nature, he touched on an essential faculty of our cognition that permits us to recognize and appreciate the purposiveness of nature— the purposiveness that expresses itself in the seed that grows to become a mighty oak, the purposiveness that seems to tell us this must have been designed this way.

While Kant agreed that we feel something is beautiful when we sense something like purposiveness in it, he believed the ancients erred in thinking such purposiveness was an essential aspect of nature itself. As he wrote, “In the necessity of that which is purposive and so constituted as if it were intentionally arranged for our use, but which nevertheless seems to pertain originally to the essence of things, without any regard to our use, lies the ground for the great

195

admiration of nature.”18 Key here is the phrase “as if.” The ground for our admiration, Kant insisted, lies not outside in the world but in our reason’s relation to the picture we make of the world. So powerful is the draw of that picture’s coherence that the ancients projected it outward into the world itself, transforming an inner sense of purposiveness into an actual purpose. There is indeed purposiveness, structure, rigor in our picture of nature, Kant replied, but it is supplied by our own reason.

Just as Kant showed that we must presuppose the existence of a whole, unified cosmos for our individual observations to cohere, even though we can never grasp that whole cosmos as an object, the harmony between parts of a system and its internal guiding principle is not an empirical fact that can be established for once and for all but a presumption necessary for deriving laws in the first place. We cannot see the oak tree in the seed, and yet we also cannot coherently grasp how seeds develop into oak trees without imagining them as being guided by a final purpose throughout their growth. Discovering such harmony ignites in us a feeling of beauty, and we are driven to it— not only in works of art or the appreciation of nature, but in science itself. Indeed, the standards that scientists report as guiding their preferences— the preference for the economy of nature’s laws over their profligacy; the ideal of simplicity that guided science from Newton’s discovery of the laws of motion to Einstein’s gorgeous simplification and incorporation of gravity— make sense when we see them no longer as part of nature itself but as things we impose on nature to make sense of it.19

In this respect, our appreciation of artistic works provides us with a model for detecting purposiveness in nature. In artworks like Mahler’s symphonies, we recognize a masterful hand that had a reason for placing each note where it was. We know there is a purpose there, and we hear it as we progress through the symphony; we marvel at its perfection. In nature we experience a similar marvel when we contemplate the towering oak that emerged from a tiny seed or realize that the movement of every massive object in the skies can be

196

described and predicted by a few calculations. But whereas in nature we are attracted by the sense of a guiding hand even when there is none, in art the analogy is reversed: we are attracted to products of a guiding hand where the hand itself has become invisible. For a work of art whose artistry is too evident loses its ability to cause wonder; it becomes staid and predictable. In both art and nature, we see beauty in signs of purposiveness without purpose, natural artistry— but with an important difference. Whereas in nature we supply the artist, in art we supply the sense of its naturalness, that it was produced without evident artifice.

This structural analogy between the natural and the artistic both animates our appreciation of the products of the imagination and provides a standard for judgments about disputes of taste. The fact is, we do this all the time. Let’s return to the example of a mystery novel. You make it through three-h undred- plus pages, and the culprit turns out to be a character you’ve never met before with no connection to the story so far. Surprising? Certainly, but no one in their right mind would judge this to be an excellent way to end the story. Now let’s say that in the mystery you’re reading, each clue led so inevitably to the final revelation that you could see it coming a hundred pages before the end. Clearly that would be unsatisfying as well. In the first case you would be faced with a random occurrence, an unmotivated insertion into the structure of the novel that destroyed any sense of its coherence, its purposiveness. The novel is certainly surprising, but there is nothing inevitable about it—t he occurrences seem random, without purpose. In the second case, however, you’ve seen the author’s handiwork the whole way through; it’s all inevitability with no surprise, all artifice with no naturalness. Unlike with Mahler, our first reaction is that we could do that ourselves just by following a recipe. The result is a work of “art” that no one wants to spend their time on.

Purposiveness without purpose is thus a model for making claims about the aesthetic value of works of art, since we find art beautiful if it exhibits a harmony as if it had arisen there naturally.

In this way it releases us from the conundrum of radical subjectivism, whereby all are entitled to their own opinion about a work’s value and there are no rational bases for arguing about it. The irony of such subjectivism is that while it sounds coherent enough (how indeed can I trump someone’s argument that, hey, this is beautiful because I find it beautiful?), no one in practice seems to believe it. As Kant puts it, in matters of taste there is a real difference between saying you like something and saying that it is beautiful. In the latter case your statement implicitly demands concurrence, whereas in the former it does not.20 Purposiveness without purpose provides an objective standard for arguing why one finds one work more beautiful than another.

But purposiveness without purpose is also a model for understanding the appeal of scientific explanations of the natural world, since we are attracted by theories that reveal the harmony between specific observations and a general explanation as if that harmony had been put there by design. This fit between the knowability of the world and our ability to know it engenders aesthetic pleasure—n ot a fulfillment of personal benefit or the satisfaction of appetite, but the pure joy of experiencing, in a flash, how a single rule explains the functioning of seemingly disparate aspects of nature.

In a satisfying work of art, the ensemble of its elements conforms to its internal principle, the idea that guides it. Thus, when we come to the end of a mystery novel, the solution appears inevitable, although we couldn’t see it coming. Likewise, when we find a theoretical explanation for the seemingly random events of the natural world, we feel the same aesthetic satisfaction as with a well- wrought plot or a masterfully composed symphony: we thrill to the diversity of nature expressing the idea of its order, its inherent rigor. That guiding principle that we read in nature or in art appears to us its purpose. But just as the work of art ignites our aesthetic judgment only when its creator has erased the signs of artifice, so our understanding of the natural world is led by a silent conviction that the universe that unveils itself before our eyes works toward an end and

198

purpose, one it expresses from the greatest cataclysms of galaxies down to the most intimate crevices of possible perception, and yet one that was never meant, never intended, never planned by angel, god, or human mind, other than our own.

as a new decade dawned, Kant was feeling impatient. During the last, astoundingly productive ten years he had published more important, not to say world- changing, works of philosophy on a wider array of topics than pretty much anyone before him. But two of his most widely read works during that time, the Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals and The Critique of Practical Reason, had taken far longer to appear in print than he had anticipated. Now, eager to see the third major chapter of his critical philosophy in bookstores and sparking conversations, he decided to change publishers. Between January and March 1790, he sent his new editor in Berlin his manuscript of the Critique of the Power of Judgment in four batches as he finished them. The editor had clearly gotten the memo. By April, Kant was already grumbling about having to plow through page proofs, and the book would appear shortly thereafter.21

As busy as this period was, other tasks loomed. Kant was not getting any younger, and he had his philosophical legacy to attend to. Anyone getting the kind of attention he now found focused on him was bound to become the target of some negative reviews, and one managed to get under Kant’s skin. The criticism, the work of one J. A. Eberhard, came out in four volumes over three years. Even as Kant was rushing to finish his third Critique, the tenor of the attack started to irk him. In essence, Eberhard accused Kant of not being original; he claimed that Leibniz had foreseen Kant and worked out a better system. Moreover, in the few ways they differed, Kant had simply gotten it wrong.22

Kant was not about to take this lying down. In the brief hiatus between sending in the preface and introduction of the third Critique to his editor on March 22 and receiving the proofs a month

199

later, he published a small book in response. The title, On a Discovery According to Which Any New Critique of Pure Reason Has Been Made Superfluous by an Earlier One, would have made Borges proud for its temporal acrobatics and dripping irony. In “discovering” that Leibniz’s philosophy was somehow a better critique of pure reason than Kant’s even prior to Kant’s dismantling of it, Eberhard had not only utterly failed to understand what Kant was doing; he had also pretty much mangled Leibniz in the process, exposing him “to ridicule just when he thinks he is providing him with an apology.”23

Obviously, Kant’s system agreed significantly with Leibniz’s, Kant conceded. Specifically, both systems argued for a kind of harmony between the natural world and the moral one. The distinction, however, lay in how each thinker got there, and this distinction made all the difference. For Leibniz the very reason we could trust the laws of physics was the reason to trust the existence of an ultimate moral law, for just as surely as God’s hand guided the one, it had to be guiding the other. The lawfulness of nature and of morality emerged from the programmer’s code, and all we had to do was read it. Kant’s critical philosophy had upended this way of thinking for good. Nature’s ultimate lawfulness, the necessary link between cause and effect, the tendrils connecting genus and species— all of these could be derived as necessary presuppositions of our ability to perceive individual objects in time and space. They were aspects of our knowledge, to be sure, but also aspects with necessity and hence objectivity. Likewise, as we will see in greater detail in the next chapter, the ultimate freedom of the human subject to choose and the nature of its moral duty could not depend on any religious doctrine or earthly tradition, but was a necessary presupposition for a being who finds itself confronting moral choices, because a being that was truly unfree and merely adrift in the flow of causal connections could only ever do as it was inclined to do; the mere fact of being faced with choices required the postulate of freedom.

So, harmony exists between the natural world and the moral one, between empirical judgments of causality and free moral choices,

200

but only if one understands, as Leibniz had not yet, that this harmony flows not from a divine code but as a necessary condition of possibility of our ability to perceive and think about the movement of bodies in space and time and to make decisions in a social world. Kant’s work could indeed be considered the real defense of Leibniz, Kant concluded— a defense, namely, against such ostensible defenders as Eberhard himself.24

Kant’s review had eviscerated the hapless critic. If alternate philosophical paths to the Kantian revolution had held any attraction for young thinkers, this slap- down pretty much nipped those growths in the bud. As the last decade of the eighteenth century debuted, philosophy in Germany, for all intents and purposes, had become a footnote to the work of one man, a man who had attained the stature of, in the words of an admiring visitor, the king of Königsberg.

Kant trounced his critic so decisively in part because the book he had just finished writing, his Critique of the Power of Judgment, had finally clarified exactly how to salvage the lawfulness of nature without falling prey to the metaphysical grandiosity of claiming to discern its ultimate purpose. For the presumption of an invisible hand guiding nature is pervasive; we see it in how scientists choose one theory over another because of its economy, simplicity, or beauty; we see it when physicists lift the veil of nature and discover the mathematical laws that structure it; we see it at work in the greatest of minds, as when Einstein denied that the Old One plays dice with the universe.

Kant also saw this apparent guiding hand at work, especially in his approach to the organic world. Indeed, Kant seemed to presage Darwin by half a century when he wrote that a more fulsome natural history would “trace back a host of apparently diverse types of races to one and the same genus.”25 But where others would see such manifestations of teleological causality as evidence of a greater power at work in nature, Kant saw a conflict within our faculty of reason between two ways of ordering its impressions. The first of these modes correctly grasps the causal relations between events

201

within space- time; however, when reason uses that mode to follow its investigations of space-t ime events to their extremes— when it inquires about those ultimate questions, such as the shortest sliver of space- time, the edge of the universe, the ultimate cause of everything, or the possibility of making a free choice—i t arrives at a point where mechanistic explanations fall short. Such questions require a different mode of thinking, one that asks why this law, why this overall structure, why these initial conditions and not some others, why this choice and not that one.

Each mode of thinking— one concerned with mechanistic steps within and the other with the holistic question of purpose—i s necessary and justified in its own sphere. When we confuse them, however, error and even fanaticism ensue. Perhaps we end up like Candide, blithely insisting that we inhabit the best of all possible worlds, for how else could God have chosen this one for us? Worse, we might become convinced the world is a manifestation of our idea of its ultimate purpose, that we are required to intervene with fire and fury to set things right. Or, as rational scientists, we might end up expressing amazement that the laws of nature would be so finely tuned as to permit our existence and feel forced to conjure rather less than parsimonious theories to account for the gratifying fit.

Our astonishment, however, belies the mere fact that what is, is; that the world as we find it must always be the starting point for our investigations; that to seek to account for the improbability of the universe existing is like expressing delight that out of eight billion possible souls you had the luck to be born as you. Just as there was no you before you were born to feel lucky for, we don’t need to imagine the fate of all those universes that didn’t evolve into ours. For such is the sleight of hand of both the Leibnizian rationalist and modern advocates of the multiverse, who transform the mathematical reasoning that allows us to explain the world as we find it in space and time into a vision of the cosmos as an unconditioned whole, planting it there in the desert before creation, only to then 202 feel awe that it should have grown this way at all.

This, then, was Kant’s insight: the deist who believes the universe came about by design and the atheist physicist who turns to theories like the multiverse to explain the extreme improbability of our own creation both err. They err by treating individual events in space- time as if they were guided by a ghost in the machine; they err, likewise, by conceiving of the entirety of existence as a thing in time and space, subject to the vicissitudes of cause and effect, a bauble in the hands of the god of very large things. But deists and scientists confronting the improbability of our existence do not err when they feel awe; their mistake lies in the source they attribute to that feeling and the scenarios they come up with to explain it away. For just as our power of judgment, when correctly understood and limited, sees beauty in nature’s laws as in the well- constructed work of art, it supplies a different aesthetic feeling when faced with the incommensurability between what we can grasp with our limited senses and the absolutely great or overwhelmingly powerful, those cosmic phenomena that utterly outstrip the scale of our human perceptions.

Faced with the irreconcilability of our cognition and the whole of the cosmos, its origin and edge, or between that cognition and the most minute alterations in space and time, we are struck not by a feeling of beauty but by what Kant calls the sublime. The vertigo we feel in the face of the infinitesimal; the awe we succumb to when we face the inconceivable mathematics of the cosmos or the cataclysmic raging of black holes we can never grasp with our senses— confronted with these we are overcome with a sense of the overwhelming scope and force of nature. And yet, Kant specifies, at the source of this feeling, this scintillating mélange of pleasure and pain, lies not those objects themselves but a disposition of our souls. For at the very moment we engage with phenomena that outstrip our capacity to grasp them as a whole, we also witness the inexhaustibility of our cognitive means, which permit us to transcend our limited locales and stretch to the ends of the universe.26 That science

203

can calculate the density of black holes or the values of fundamental constants of nature is a strength beyond measure. Our feeling of nature’s sublimity pays tribute to this: the force of our intellectual capacities.

The sublime, like the beautiful, does not reside in things in the world, whether natural or made; it emerges as a reaction of our judgment to the representations we make of the world. For our representations to cohere, we must assume a greater order to them that ultimately outstrips our ability to verify it. As we verify such order locally, our judgment gratifies us with a feeling of beauty, of the parts fitting an ideal of the whole, a center that seems to contain the astonishing variety of existence and give it sense or purpose. In contrast, whenever we engage phenomena that threaten to overwhelm our ability to grasp them with our senses, reason stretches in a vain attempt to comprehend the very edges of totality itself, the border conditions of the universe, small and large, and we are taken simultaneously by our inadequacy to the challenge and by the awesome power of reason that permits us to conceptualize that very impossibility in the first place.

The capillaries of coherence flowing from species to genus, from the particular to the universal, are the necessary presupposition that permits us to encounter and differentiate particulars in the first place. As we uncover those patterns of coherence, we experience their necessity and feel pleasure. Contemplating such purposiveness, we are lulled by its harmony, but we simultaneously strive toward a totality whose very incomprehensibility stokes that desire like an ever- present dissonance we desperately wish to resolve. Stretching out from ourselves to resolve that incompatibility, we ultimately realize what we are striving for lies inside us; we find ourselves in the world and the world in ourselves. For when Kant contemplated “the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me,” he was filled with awe, an awe that sprang from the realization that, whether staring in or staring out, he was gazing into the same unfathomable abyss.27

204

kant took seriously the notion that the state of the physical world at any time flows directly from the position and momentum of its constituent particles at prior times. Any attempt to smuggle another kind of causality into that chain of events amounts to a “mental jugglery that only reads the conception of an end into the nature of the things.”28 A disembodied soul was not, for Kant, a plausible answer. Nonetheless, although Kant considered the causal chains that sustain our knowledge of the world in space and time to be necessary, as he used his reason to pry open the linkages of space- time, he encountered a roadblock there, an insurmountable impasse that would arise whenever human cognition would try to apply the logic of space and time beyond the limits of our ability to discern differences in space and time.

Precisely there, at the most minute points of continuity between one moment and the next, Kant saw an antinomy rear its head. On the one side, a perfectly mechanistic chain, with no room for willful intervention into the course of history. On the other, spontaneous freedom of choice, not only evidenced throughout history and every living moment, but also, Kant believed, required by the very nature of practical reason itself, a freedom inherent in the very acts of judging ourselves and others that lie at the basis of all social organization. Each side could be flawlessly argued: every action in space and time has an efficient cause, and nothing is spontaneous; or, any sequence of events must have an origin that is not caused, hence spontaneity must exist.

But like any antinomy, Kant could see that it did not arise from an error on one side; rather, the error lay in a failure to understand the basic structure and limits of human knowledge, and in our tendency to mix two ways of thinking about nature and the knowledge we have of it. On the one hand, our very ability to discern the most minimal change entails that our observation span at least two moments and hence elude total absorption in the event being observed. Thus, as we delve into each individual link in the causal chain, we find it relies on any two elements being related by a third, a

205

mediator whose intervention must slip out unnoticed for the chain to appear unbroken— just as the beads of condensation require the physicist’s theory to produce an electron’s path in a cloud chamber.29 On the other hand, even as our very act of analyzing the world seems to require it, we are unable to isolate that alien influence. No matter how deeply we dig into the space-t ime chain, we will never find a link put there by free choice; we can never find a particle of consciousness, a material embodiment of soul. For us to register the moment of change from one space- time cell to the next requires that there exist some anchor in the flow that can register differences, and hence a pivot from which to choose what to observe. But try as we may, we cannot find that anchor and turn it into an object of our cognition.

Faced with this antinomy between freedom and determinism, many modern scientists and thinkers have simply decided that one side, freedom, needs to fall out of the equation. If freedom conflicts with science, so much the worse for freedom. But this solution entirely misses the point. The antinomy between mechanistic causality and freedom is rife throughout scientific thinking and practice, even among scientists who are unaware they are postulating freedom at all. Freedom implies choice, implies selection. By denying it to individuals in time and space, scientists and philosophers who profess to believe exclusively in mechanistic causality reintroduce it elsewhere, namely, at the edge of existence, in the form of that magical set of conditions that allowed us to emerge, evolve, and eventually observe the universe that birthed us.

In the case of the strong anthropic principle, this move is obvious, but it pertains to the weak principle’s concept of the multiverse as well, just more subtly. Because what is free will other than the presumption of something uncaused inserting itself in a causal chain? In the case of the anthropic principle, we remove that uncaused cause from within time and space, from within the causal chain, and place it outside time and space, before universes birth, so that we can say all initial settings give birth to all possible universes, and hence

206

explain away the improbability of our existence. We implicitly imagine a choice of universes outside space and time awaiting their manifestation in space- time to be tested out for their livability— much like a shop filled with differently sized suits waiting to be tried on.

But uncaused causality doesn’t belong outside time and space, certainly not as a cognizable object, namely, a specific universe with definable constants. Uncaused causality can never be found, never turned into an object. As we will see in the next chapter, it can only ever be, and in fact must be, presupposed in the context of human choices. For when we do not do so, we treat humans as calculable entities, as means to get from one causal link to another, and we make an untenable presumption about the ultimate causal chain, namely, that it is knowable from beginning to end.

The outermost border of all that exists and has existed coincides with the innermost point, a point where one moment slides into the next, where a here differs ever so slightly from a there, thus allowing something like an experience of the world to take form in the first place. Both are sites of the breakdown of causality because causality happens in time and space, and both the edge of space-t ime and the instant of change are ideal assumptions that cannot be found in space- time. Whenever we claim to encounter them from the outside, to encompass them as knowable objects, we commit metaphysical overreach, whether in the form of birthing phantom universes or obliterating human freedom.

This nexus between the edge of existence and the abyss of freedom was what Kant identified when he said that the two things that filled him with admiration and awe were the starry heavens above and the moral law within. In both cases we are faced with the sublime, the aesthetic feeling produced by our realization that we can conceive of something overwhelmingly absolute—t he cosmos in all its magnitude, our implacable obligation to choose— from the confines of an existence hemmed in by space, time, and contingency. If beauty guides us toward the coherence of nature as grasped by our understanding, the sublime points to both the incommensurability

207

of our abilities with that end and the inexhaustibility of the cognitive means at our disposal. Or, to say it again with Heisenberg, “The ability of human beings to understand is without limit. About the ultimate things we cannot speak.”30

The antinomy between freedom and determinism thus emerges from the very tools we use to study and understand the cosmos. We don’t escape it by assuming away freedom any more than we escape it by placing an all-k nowing god at the origin of creation to guide our every decision throughout history. For when we believe that nature takes its orders from something akin to our reason, we project a choice there, a selection from among a random or even infinite field of options. We presume, in other words, the specter of an original free choice even as we deny that freedom in our selves.

We can make sense of the antinomy only when we understand and accept that our cognition has two modes of ordering the world as we encounter it and that both have their place. One pertains to explaining local and discrete changes in space-t ime; the other kicks in whenever we explore the edges of our knowledge, whenever we ask the big questions of where it all came from, what should I do, and am I making this choice freely or am I constrained. When we use the one in the domain of the other, when we think mechanistically about our obligations or the whole of creation, or when we apply teleological thinking as we drill down into the phenomena of nature, we fall into error.

Such was the case of Heisenberg’s radical revelation. Driven by Einstein’s conviction that the cosmos must have a final cause, that God does not play dice, he drilled down far indeed into the mechanisms mediating between tiny slivers of space-t ime, into the invisible spaces between the dots comprising an electron’s path in a cloud chamber. But as Kant warned, “human reason, adhering to this maxim and proceeding on these lines, could never discover a particle of foundation” that would complete the picture of nature as we expect it to be.31 Einstein and his followers would never tire of seeking such a particle, the one that would eradicate the trouble208 some quantum egg and put the world back on its expected footing. Heisenberg somehow intuited that such a final particle was, like the paradoxical edge of existence itself, a stitch holding together the fabric of the world we dream, a tenuous and eternal crevice of unreason that tells us it is false.

In the final section we will follow Kant, Borges, and Heisenberg as they delved into that final crevice of unreason that sprouts between freedom and determinism, and that condemned them to take responsibility for the choices that made them who they were.






PUTTING THE DEMON TO REST

On a cool sunday in late April 1934, the Washington Senators’ catcher Morris Berg made a fielding error. That error broke what had been an American League record of 117 consecutive error- free games— a high point in an otherwise average baseball career. After leaving the Senators later that summer, Berg played for the Cleveland Indians and then joined the American all- star team as their third- string catcher for a trip to Japan before moving to Boston, where he played his last five seasons with the Red Sox.

While mostly unremarkable on the baseball diamond, Moe Berg earned fame and respect for what he did outside the ballpark. A graduate of Princeton and Columbia, he was known for his smarts and his ability to speak multiple languages, a trait his teammates shrugged off with the practiced nonchalance of the bullpen. As the Senators’ outfielder Dave Harris quipped when asked about the seven languages his teammate reportedly spoke, “Yeah, I know, . . . and he can’t hit in any of them.”1 When he appeared on the popular quiz show Information Please in 1939, Berg essentially broke the radio, spouting disquisitions ranging from the meaning of words

251

in ancient languages to dates of obscure events in history. After that star turn, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the league’s first commissioner, told him he had done more for baseball in half an hour than Landis himself had done in his entire tenure. But Moe Berg’s most important service was yet to come.

In 1942, General William Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic Services, started assembling a team of spies dedicated to ferreting out information about the state of Germany’s atomic research. He appointed Moe Berg to lead the team. By 1944, Berg, now posted in Switzerland, picked up the scent of his number one quarry: the head of Germany’s nuclear research project, Werner Heisenberg. Concerned that Heisenberg could be working on an atomic bomb, Berg joined forces with an experimental physicist at Zurich’s Polytechnic University, Paul Scherrer, a committed anti- Nazi, and persuaded him to invite Heisenberg to give a lecture. While they prioritized detaining and questioning Heisenberg and his fellow physicists, the Allies didn’t exclude more drastic options, should the need arise. Berg attended the talk and sat next to Heisenberg at the dinner Scherrer hosted after the event, a loaded pistol under his jacket. He never had to use his firearm that evening. Heisenberg spoke about an obscure new attempt at creating a unified field theory. He didn’t mention atomic weapons once.2

Because Berlin had increasingly been leveled by Allied bombing, all scientific operations, including Heisenberg’s atomic research facility located in the ominously (and deliberately) named Virus House on the grounds of the Kaiser Wilhelm Research Institute, had been forced to seek alternate quarters in the small town of Hechingen, in Germany’s Black Forest. There, in the hectic last months of the war, Heisenberg had come closer than ever before to producing a sustained fission reactor. Having decided that killing Heisenberg wasn’t warranted, Berg next coordinated his capture. From the postmark on an intercepted letter to a Swiss colleague, Berg now knew the location of Heisenberg’s new lab.

On April 19, as Allied forces closed in on Hechingen, Heisen-

252

berg mounted the sole form of transportation left to him, a bicycle, and headed east, his only thought to rejoin his wife, Elisabeth, and their six children. Heisenberg’s family had been living out the war’s last months suffering from cold and hunger in a mountain lodge in Urfeld, in the Bavarian mountains, to which they had decamped when their house in Leipzig had been razed by bombs. Urfeld was 250 kilometers from Hechingen. Heisenberg pedaled by night to avoid being shot by American aircraft or by roving German commandos, desperately fulfilling their führer’s final orders to kill any Germans seen fleeing the enemy.3

On the day that Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide in Berlin, the U.S. command in Heidelberg sent a team in search of Heisenberg. The team’s leader, Colonel Boris T. Pash, driven by the urgency of what he believed to be “the most important single intelligence mission of the war,” was relentless in his pursuit.4 Arriving in the nearby town of Kochel on May 1, 1945, Pash’s troops reported that the bridge on the only road leading up the mountain to Urfeld had been demolished and the road was impassable. Not to be deterred, Pash and a few men climbed the still snow- covered mountain by foot. Upon reaching the tiny town, they exchanged fire with some of the German battalion that occupied the town. During a pause in the firefight, Pash saw two officers approaching on scooters. While discussing terms with them, he realized that the Germans believed him to have far more than the few soldiers who had hiked up with him. Deciding it would be unwise to correct this impression, he ordered the Germans to assemble their men in the town the next day for an organized surrender. Once the scooters drove off again, he and his party hurried back down the mountain and used the bought time to repair the bridge in the night, allowing the rest of his trucks and men to pull in to town the following morning just in time to accept the Germans’ surrender.

Only after taking charge of his prisoners did Pash turn to the pressing business at hand. Accompanied by two soldiers, he hiked the remaining way up the mountain to the front steps of Heisen-

253

berg’s mountain retreat, where he found the great physicist awaiting him on his veranda. Heisenberg politely invited Pash in, introduced him to his wife and children, and then gathered his belongings and accompanied the colonel into custody.5

Given the nature of their quarry, it was natural that Pash’s team would include a scientist. The one chosen for the job was Samuel Goudsmit, a Dutch experimental physicist who had immigrated to the United States to take up a position at the University of Michigan long before the war broke out. Goudsmit had met Heisenberg as a young man and had been duly awed by the genius who had founded the field of quantum mechanics. He had enjoyed conversations with him again when Heisenberg lectured at the University of Michigan in 1939.

During the early years of the war Goudsmit had become increasingly alarmed for the safety of his aging parents. After the Nazis occupied the Netherlands, he set to work obtaining visas for them. Tragically, they had only just received their papers when the deportation of Dutch Jews began in earnest in 1943. Before they could escape, they were rounded up and delivered to Auschwitz. Heisenberg received an appeal through common friends to advocate for the Goudsmits, to which he responded by writing a letter touting his own experience of their hospitality to him and other Germans during visits to Holland. It was to no avail. By the time he had written the letter, the Goudsmits had met their end in the gas chambers. Not long after the death of his parents, Samuel Goudsmit, now a U.S. agent in charge of tracking down Germany’s atomic researchers, wept over the ruins of his childhood home, overcome “by that shattering emotion all of us have felt who have lost family and relatives and friends at the hands of the murderous Nazis.”6

Back in Urfeld, his bags packed, and tearful farewells exchanged with his wife and children, Heisenberg departed with Colonel Pash and his team for a long, bumpy journey by truck to his first detention site, the American base in Heidelberg. There he was brought into an interrogation room. As he looked across the table, he found

254

himself staring into the angry eyes of his former friend and colleague Samuel Goudsmit. The conversation that followed wouldn’t end that day. Instead, it metastasized into years of accusations and rebuttals, recriminations and rehabilitations, all swirling around the question of Werner Heisenberg’s responsibility in working for the most despicable regime the world had ever seen.

twenty years earlier, late at night in a sparsely appointed room on a barren island in the North Sea, when the fog of hay fever lifted from his brain, what Heisenberg saw spread out in mathematical script before his mind’s eye had changed humanity’s most basic assumptions about nature and our relation to it. Since Newton had derived the fundamental laws determining how objects move, scientists had become convinced that the physical reality we inhabit must follow those rules at all levels and in all ways. No matter how tiny the objects in question, or how small the distances, knowing the mass of an object, its exact place in the universe, and every force acting upon it, one could know everything about that object’s future. The only limit was on the part of the knower. Those of us observing the object might be constrained in how far or how small we could focus our gazes or instruments, but as far as the object was concerned, its fate was sealed.

On the island of Heligoland, two years even before he wrote his uncertainty paper, the abstruse mathematics Heisenberg invented to account for the before and after measurements of electrons decisively undermined that premise. The problem was that Heisenberg’s math didn’t commute. For those who haven’t had to think about math since high school, the commutative property means that what you can do in one direction, you can also do in the other. It’s the same if you multiply two times eight as if you multiply eight times two. But the commutative property that held for operations in normal mathematics no longer worked in Heisenberg’s matrices. It was as if carrying out the operation in one order undid the possibility of

255

doing it in reverse, such that the answer one got from multiplying two and eight depended on whether one decided to start with two or start with eight.

In the specific case Heisenberg was working on, the numbers were sets of numbers— these were the matrices in question— that represented either the momentum or the position of an electron as measured in an experiment. The non- commutability of his equations signified one astounding fact: the product of an electron’s observed momentum multiplied by its observed position will always be different from the product of its observed position multiplied by its observed momentum.7 In other words, it makes a difference whether one measures the momentum and then the position or the position and then the momentum, because what one chooses to start with changes the result for the next measurement.

While it took Heisenberg another two years to formulate the uncertainty principle, in some ways it too flows from this original discovery. For if the fundamental insight of quantum mechanics is that one must choose to measure position or momentum first, and what one chooses affects what one will come up with when one measures the next value, this necessarily leads to a fundamental limit on the amount of information we can have about the world. As we drill down into the most basic presumption of Newton’s classical world— namely, that knowing everything about a particle’s position and momentum and the forces acting on it means knowing its past and future— we run into an impenetrable barrier. Perfect precision in our knowledge of the one creates radical indeterminacy in our knowledge of the other.

Once we accept the truth of Heinsberg’s discovery, the hard part becomes jettisoning the assumptions we hold about what reality is or must be like. In fact, all the paradoxes associated with quantum mechanics, even the very idea made popular by Richard Feynman that “nobody understands quantum mechanics,” stem from our resistance to letting go of these assumptions.8 Indeed, letting go is hard. After all, if geniuses like Einstein couldn’t do it, if swaths of

256

top- notch physicists seem willing to go to any length to avoid letting go of it, that’s because the “it” in question contains one of our most basic beliefs about reality, namely, that it is, in Borges’s words, “ubiquitous in space and durable in time.”9

But what if it is not? What if reality is not extended smoothly in space and time, but something fundamentally different? What if space and time are themselves nothing but, as Einstein himself so brilliantly saw, the indexes of measurements, coincidences between two events noticed by a third party. In fact, if we fully, radically accept this premise as our starting point, the paradoxes of quantum mechanics dissipate like warm breath on a cold day. We quickly see that the strangeness sprang from what we expected to see, rather than from what we in fact observe.

Let’s take the measurement problem itself. How can it be, we wonder, that what we decide to measure, here and now, determines the path the electron has taken through time and space to reach us? How can the electron “know” that we detected it going through one slit, and thereby “decide,” instantly, not to have gone through the other, thus violating relativity’s ban on the superluminal transfer of information? How can one particle of an entangled pair instantaneously “tell” its other what spin it chose, no matter how far the distance has grown between them? The answer is simple. It can’t. The electron doesn’t know anything; the particle doesn’t communicate anything. We do. But what we now know in that moment pertains to us, period. We cannot transfer that knowledge anywhere else, to anyone else, other than by good, old-f ashioned subluminal communication. We may now know that since our particle has a down spin, its pair will be measured as up, but until we can communicate it, this knowledge is as irrelevant to anyone else’s knowledge of the world as is Sam Harris’s imaginary speculation of what he would be like if he swapped all the atoms in his body for those of a serial killer. Only the gods of small and large things can know this, and those gods don’t talk.

Like Frost’s walker in the woods, when I look back at my life,

257

the path I am on is the one I have taken, no other. This is what I measured; this is what I found. I may now infer what I would have found on that other path, but other walkers won’t know until they walk down it themselves.

If we accept this simple premise, we can also see the monumental metaphysical effort made by those alternative approaches to avoid this simple understanding, all because they want to salvage a specific, sacred idea of reality. Their resistance to the fundamental non- commutability that Heisenberg discovered (when they insist that our observation can’t change reality), their resistance to the fundamental limitation in how much of reality one can know (when they insist that there must have been a path there, between the observations), all comes down to this: reality is something out there, independent of us, ubiquitous in space and durable in time. But again, perhaps it’s not. Perhaps, rather, what constitutes the reality for any single entity is nothing other than the relation it has with something else, in Carlo Rovelli’s words, “the way in which one part of nature manifests itself to any other single part of nature.”10 Vitally, as that renowned physicist and creator of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics has also put it, far from conflicting with relativity, this understanding is a continuation of its most important insight, the “discovery that all the properties (variables) of all objects are relational, just as in the case of speed.”11

The twenty-f our- year- old hiking on Heligoland, the twenty- six- year- old walking at night in Copenhagen’s Faelled Park, they didn’t reflect too deeply on this problem. Those two respective moments in the life path that would be Werner Heisenberg’s were too busy sloughing off the blinders of expectations to consciously construct a new interpretation of reality. But soon, as a newly anointed professor started gathering his students around him, that man did start to ask those questions. And one of the ways he did so was by reading, discussing, and writing about the works of Immanuel Kant.

258

one of the standouts among the group of physicists who rushed to Leipzig to work with Werner Heisenberg when he assumed his professorship there was a young nobleman, Baron Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. Weizsäcker would go on to work with Heisenberg in the German atomic program as well as make important discoveries in the science of nuclear fusion, but as a young man he had studied philosophy before opting for physics, and he brought these interests with him to Leipzig. For his part, Heisenberg had already made clear the challenge that his discoveries, in particular the uncertainty principle, posed for the dominant philosophical understanding of reality. As he had written, uncertainty demolishes the law of causality that both science and philosophy presume sacrosanct, because that law depends on the premise that we can know the present fully, which uncertainty showed we cannot.

The demise of causality was not something that either scientists or philosophers were going to swallow without a fight. And so it was that in his first years as a full professor in charge of his own institute Heisenberg took that fight to the philosophers. He began with a lecture at home in Leipzig, attended by the philosophy department and interested members of a broader audience. Soon he would develop those ideas and bring them out in the form of a paper called “Causal Law and Quantum Mechanics,” which he delivered in Vienna, then the world capital of the scientifically oriented branch of philosophy known as logical positivism.12

In challenging the philosophers, Heisenberg knew that he would also have to take on the greatest of them all, Immanuel Kant. In his lectures and papers Heisenberg remained respectful of Kant’s awesome imprint on intellectual history, but he didn’t shy from claiming that quantum mechanics posed such enormous challenges to the critical system that, he feared, philosophers would now face the “very difficult task of rolling out the Kantian basic problem of epistemology once again and, so to speak, starting all over again.”13

The “basic problem” Heisenberg identified was the demarcation in Kant’s system between a priori and a posteriori knowledge, that

259

is, the portion of our knowledge that must be true, independent of all experience, and that portion we learn by interacting with the world through our senses. Kant had taught that space and time and the causal relation of events in space and time were not aspects of the world that we picked up through living in it, as Hume had argued, but rather the necessary conditions of possibility of our picking up anything at all about the world. Kant had gone further than merely positing some notion of space, time, and causality as a priori, however. In the first section of The Critique of Pure Reason he had extrapolated from the necessarily spatial and temporal form of our intuition to the basic rules of geometry itself. In other words, since space is one of the a priori forms governing our very ability to perceive the world, what we can derive about such ideal shapes as triangles and rectangles and the mathematical rules that govern them must also be a priori true. We know that the area of a triangle is one half the product of its height and its base, and this knowledge doesn’t depend on our ever having encountered or measured a triangle in our daily lives.

But this idea of geometry and the model of space and time that informed it, Heisenberg argued, had already been sidelined by Einstein’s general relativity paper, which not only had incorporated Riemann’s non- Euclidean geometry but also had made that geometry central to the very functioning of the cosmos. In the Riemannian spaces needed to understand how gravity warps space- time and ultimately the shape of the cosmos itself, the long-s tanding truth of a triangle’s area simply no longer held true, and hence the rules of Euclid couldn’t be considered a priori at all.

To make matters worse, if Einstein had done a number on space- time, Heisenberg had put the kibosh on causality. The Kantian idea of causality depended on an observer isolating an object in space and time and determining the directly preceding cause to its present situation (its position and momentum). As Heisenberg explained it, “Whereas beforehand the spatiotemporal description could be applied to an isolated object, it is now essentially linked to the inter-

260

action between the subject and its observer or its apparatus. The object in total isolation no longer has, in essence, any describable properties.”14 Heisenberg still believed the essence of Kant’s position was right; namely, that some aspect of our knowledge of the world had to come from us and not from the world. Nevertheless, that line would have to move. He had made his challenge, and it was time for the philosophers to respond.

Respond they did. But while papers abounded and some of the top thinkers in the world weighed in on the influence of quantum mechanics on Kantian thought and on philosophy in general, the most direct and ultimately effective intervention came from a rising star in neo- Kantian circles named Grete Hermann. Exercised by the challenge posed by the new physics, Hermann came to Leipzig in 1932 for a series of discussions with Heisenberg and his circle, discussions in which his newest acolyte, the aristocratic philosopher- physicist Weizsäcker, played a prominent role.

In her opening salvo, Hermann presented the challenge in precise Kantian terms. Causality can’t depend on experience, because it’s “the very basis of all experience.”15 How can experiments, which proposed to say something meaningful about the world by hypothesizing claims and testing them with apparatuses and observed results, produce knowledge of the world that undermines the very presuppositions on which our inferences are then based? In other words, if our results tell us that the most basic presuppositions for obtaining those results aren’t true, then don’t we need to be rethinking the conclusions we are drawing? If quantum mechanics has led people to believe that observable effects, such as the decay of a radium atom and emission of an electron, happen without a cause, isn’t it far more reasonable to assume the cause exists and we just haven’t delved deeply enough to find it?16

Heisenberg responded by describing a version of the two-s lit experiment. If a detection apparatus such as a screen beyond two slits registers the behavior of electronic emissions passing through those slits, it will show them interfering with each other, just as waves do

261

when passing through two sluices. But if we add an apparatus at one of the slits to determine which direction an electron went, its other possible direction is “extinguished,” and the pattern ceases to show up. If the indeterminacy of the direction of emission were simply a matter of our not knowing enough, we could presumably position monitors more closely to the sources and figure out which direction the emissions are taking. But we can’t, because when we do that, no interference occurs. The very phenomenon we are trying to learn more about disappears when we try to learn more about it. Which is to say, it’s simply not the case that our original detector doesn’t tell us the whole story and that a more precise measurement will tell us more. A particle is in multiple places until it is measured; we cannot assume a determinate time, place, or cause for its movement prior to our intervention.17

Hermann, clearly unsettled by this evidence, continued to insist that atoms and particles must be objects and hence determined by such categories as substance and causality. But while the two sides failed to bridge the chasm, Heisenberg and Weizsäcker learned something from the encounter. Before Hermann took her leave of them, Weizsäcker spelled out the position that would continue to be Heisenberg’s for the rest of his career. Space, time, and causality must indeed be treated as a priori, even for relativity and quantum theory. However, these new theories decisively changed their content.18 In what way? Kant simply could not have foreseen the development of an experimental realm “so far beyond daily experience.”19 He could therefore not foresee that atoms, simply put, aren’t objects.20

Strangely, given Heisenberg’s original position that uncertainty had in some definitive sense overturned one of Kant’s essential principles, Weizsäcker would eventually maintain that he and Heisenberg remained closer to Kant than did many of the generation of Kantian thinkers who preceded them.21 In Heisenberg’s final words on the subject, he averred that Kant’s a priori concepts formed an essential part of modern physics, albeit “in a somewhat different sense”: specifically, space, time, and causality could at one and the

262

same time be the very conditions of science and have “only a limited range of applicability.” For, on the one hand, without the assumption of the tightly linked causal chain of events, “nothing can be known about the atomic event.”22 On the other, by following that chain we come to a point that undermines those very preconditions.23

But, of course, this is exactly the paradox Kant foresaw. For all Heisenberg’s attempts to distance himself, as Weizsäcker suspected, he was moving closer to the Sage of Königsberg all the time. Heisenberg had focused on Kant’s assertions in the first part of The Critique of Pure Reason that because space and time were necessary forms of intuition and causality, they must remain unchanged for all time. In so doing, however, he overlooked the second part of the book, the part in which Kant laid out in detail the heuristic nature of these provisions and the paradoxes that would emerge whenever one overstepped and treated them as possible objects of knowledge. There, and later in his third Critique, Kant had stipulated that the continuity of all existence in space and time and the causal chain linking all events were both necessary presumptions and ultimately unknowable. Whether drilling down into the tightest crevices of space-t ime or pulling back to contemplate the whole of existence, a scientist could not avoid the abyss that awaited there, an abyss that haunts the limits approached by ever more accurate measurements just as it hovered at the borders of the universe itself.24

Despite appearances to the contrary, we can and must both presume causality (to draw inferences from our observations) and accept the uncertainty those observations lead to, for even though the extremity of measurements enabled by modern physics was not available to him, Kant knew this: there must be a point at which the minute analysis of causal chains breaks down, not because it lands on one or the other side of the antinomy that lies there, but because that antinomy cannot be solved as long as we treat as real the heuristic assumptions needed to make inferences in the first place. Indeed, just as the universe as a whole must in some sense be contained by its center, so must our attempts to plumb the depths of analysis,

263

to arrive at “an experimental realm so far beyond daily experience,” reveal to us the embodied antinomy of what constitutes the very essence of a thing in the world. The atoms, the particles we seek there, “are neither things nor objects.”25

“In that case what are they?” Grete Hermann asked Heisenberg and Weizsäcker that day in Leipzig. “We lack the right term,” Heisenberg responded, “for our language is based on daily experience, and atoms are not.” Atoms, he went on, are the words we use to describe “parts of observational situations.” They are the marker of a relation that pertains to only that relation, “since all the terms with which we describe experience apply to a limited realm only.”26 In other words, the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, like those of the antinomies Kant traced from Zeno to his own time, didn’t emerge from Heisenberg’s discovery. They were born of the attempt to make that discovery conform to a God’s-eye view on nature that was never ours to have in the first place.

at 8:15 in the morning of August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima, leveling most of its buildings, enveloping it in a cloud of radioactivity, and killing well over a hundred thousand civilians. On the other side of the world Werner Heisenberg was having dinner with his team of German scientists at an estate called Farm Hall, in Godmanchester, England. Soon after his detention and interrogation in Heidelberg by Samuel Goudsmit, Heisenberg had been moved to France and then ultimately to Farm Hall, where he and his team would be interned for the next six months. When the news came on the radio that evening, it cast a pall over the room. The scientists were stunned. As the group slowly came to and started to converse again, Heisenberg told the others, “I was absolutely convinced of the possibility of our making a uranium engine but I never thought that we would make a bomb and at the bottom of my heart I was really glad that it was to be an engine and not a bomb.”27

264

Heisenberg and his team had been working on nuclear fission for several years. In 1942, Heisenberg had reported to the Nazi government that while theoretically possible to weaponize, the quantities of uranium 235 needed to produce a bomb made it impractical to do so. Had he been wrong? Or had he feared the overwhelming moral implications of harnessing for violent ends the power his own discoveries had played such a large role in uncovering? A year earlier Heisenberg traveled to occupied Denmark and met in private with Niels Bohr. Their respective accounts of that conversation differ significantly, have led to decades of speculation about the purpose of the visit, and even inspired a Tony Award–w inning play. Did Heisenberg go to Copenhagen to extract information from Bohr, to learn something about the Allies’ intentions and potential progress with regard to an atomic weapon? Or did he go to Copenhagen to try to arrive at a tacit agreement with Bohr not to use their knowledge for such destructive purposes? As they walked alone, with no third party to hear them, did he really pose the question he later claimed to have asked Bohr during their much- disputed meeting in Copenhagen in 1941, “if as a physicist one had the moral right to work on the practical exploitation of atomic energy”?28

According to his recollections, as he listened in horror to the reports from Japan, Heisenberg felt devastated. He had thought that Bohr, that the great Einstein, so vocal in his opposition to war and violence, would have entertained the same qualms he had. One week later, Heisenberg lectured to his colleagues and explained to them exactly how the bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki had worked. Perhaps he had miscalculated, but there’s almost no doubt that Heisenberg could have worked it out, had he truly wished to do so.

The response formulated by the group the night they learned of the destruction of Hiroshima would become the basis of Heisenberg’s own version of the role he played in Germany’s atomic project: namely, the German atomic team had concluded early in 1942 that, while possible, producing an atomic bomb would be so costly as to be impractical. That the scientists were, furthermore, uncon-

265

vinced of the moral rectitude of such work. That Heisenberg had used the prospect of weaponization to keep the Nazi regime interested enough in his work to continue funding and supporting it even while secretly having decided that “an energy-p roducing uranium burner for powering machines”29 was the “only goal attainable.”30 And that his group had tacitly decided it would not work toward the production of a weapon. In 1946 he went so far as to claim that, given their scientific assessment of the impracticality of pursuing a weapon, the German scientists had been spared “the difficult moral decision” taken by their American counterparts.31

For the Americans, such public pronouncements by Germany’s most famous scientist and one of the founders of their field were nearly unbearable. Robert Oppenheimer, for instance, who had led the Manhattan Project and even had a hand in selecting the Japanese targets, suffered enormous feelings of guilt in the years after the war’s cataclysmic end. The outrage he and his fellows felt now, to be implicitly lectured by colleagues who had chosen to continue to work for a regime like that of the Nazis, was palpable. As one American physicist put it, just as the U.S. team had, the “German scientists worked for the military as best their circumstances allowed.” The unforgivable difference, he added, was that “they worked for the cause of Himmler and Auschwitz, for the burners of books and the takers of hostages.”32

The debate over the culpability for the development of nuclear weapons would extend for many years, and for many years Heisenberg would embody the German side. The face of the other side would be the same one Heisenberg had gazed into when he was ushered into the interrogation room in Heidelberg: Samuel Goudsmit. Goudsmit had been chosen for his role in tracking down and interrogating German scientists both for his knowledge and for his lack of it. On the one hand, he had deep reserves of expertise in theoretical and atomic physics; on the other, he was not a part of the top secret Manhattan Project and knew nothing of his colleagues’ progress. For Heisenberg’s part, once captured and sitting across

266

the table from his former colleague, he felt the war was lost and seemed at peace with that and ready to move on to a more promising future. As he recalled their conversations in Heidelberg, he told Goudsmit of the German determination not to pursue a bomb and asked him point- blank about the American team’s position. Goudsmit responded that they had “made no efforts in that direction” and that they had “more important things to do.”33 Years later Heisenberg would confess to Elisabeth his shock when he realized that Goudsmit had lied to him.34

From Goudsmit’s perspective, made public in a best-s elling book, Heisenberg and the Germans were disingenuous at best, highly complicit at worst. Where Heisenberg protested that his team knew a bomb was possible but decided not to pursue it for both practical and moral reasons, Goudsmit drew the exact opposite interpretation: the Germans under Heisenberg’s leadership were too incompetent to realize its feasibility and had covered that incompetence with false moralization, made even more heinous by their willingness to work for an evil regime. Heisenberg became for Goudsmit the face of the complacent incompetence that permitted German physics, once the pride of the world, to be overtaken by the upstart Americans. Trapped by their ideology of racial superiority and besotted by what he called “the smug Heisenberg clique,” the Germans simply couldn’t imagine that the Americans could succeed where they had failed.35

Heisenberg aired his own umbrage just as publicly. In a series of letters published in Nature, The New York Times, and elsewhere, he defended the scientific and moral integrity of his colleagues. In his telling, the Germans knew the theoretical steps involved in runaway fission; they simply lacked the resources of the American technological and industrial machine. Not to be deterred, Goudsmit in his response hewed to the central theme of his book: German science failed because of its totalitarian regime, and Heisenberg, while no doubt resisting the Nazis, did so “not because they were bad, but because they were bad for Germany, or at least for German science.”36

267

The day after the news of the destruction of Hiroshima reached Farm Hall, the detainees gathered to discuss and draft what would become their official statement. Max von Laue was there and would openly support the statement for many years. Still, later in his life he distanced himself, noting that the position the Germans took that day had been largely orchestrated by Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker and that during the discussions “I did not hear the mention of any ethical point of view.” Heisenberg, he went on to add, emphasizing the point with italics, “was mostly silent.”37

Whether Heisenberg truly felt the ethical qualms he later claimed; or whether these were concocted over time to hide his complicity; or, as is also possible, whether he genuinely came to believe he had more concerns than he had at the time: these questions are profoundly difficult to decide. That difficulty in part springs from the challenge that always faces historians: that our object of study, the past, is divided from us by an ever- thickening veil of time that obscures our vision of the events we strive to understand. But this very true limitation on our historical knowledge smuggles with it an assumption about our knowledge of the present. It implies that, were we to pierce that veil of time, were we to be present for certain conversations or even to inhabit the consciousness of the persons whose intentions we wish to understand, our vision would be crystal clear, and we would have our answer. But what if our assumption is wrong? What if the obscurity inherent in viewing the past lurks in the present as well?

In 1949, a scant four years after the end of the war, the Allies lifted their prohibition on nuclear research in Germany. Heisenberg and his colleagues immediately set to work, and within less than ten years the Federal Republic of Germany had become one of the world’s leading producers and exporters of atomic energy. Heisenberg’s personal investment in nuclear as a source of power, however, accompanied a fierce conviction that his own country should never be trusted with nuclear weapons. Whether genuine or politically motivated or some mixture of the two, the horror he had expressed 268 in Farm Hall and the worry he had evinced in Copenhagen led Heisenberg to militate against the weaponization of atomic power. When NATO proposed a plan to equip the German army with tactical nuclear weapons in 1955, Heisenberg and his circle openly opposed it and mobilized the German populace in their support.

Germany’s ban on nuclear weapons has lasted to this day.

Likewise, he was convinced that science could best remain peaceful by being an international concern, and to this end he lobbied for the centralization of atomic research at the European level, becoming an early advocate for the foundation of CERN, the fabled pan- European nuclear research center located in Geneva, now the home of the Large Hadron Collider, the most massive machine ever built by humankind. In 1952 he also took the helm of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany’s government-s ponsored program to send its postdoctoral students around the world to collaborate and share knowledge. He held this position for more than two decades, until illness prevented him from continuing his work.38

On February 1, 1976, Werner Heisenberg died after a long battle with kidney cancer. A few years earlier, enjoying the twilight of his years in his mountain cabin in Urfeld, the aging physicist had reflected on his early readings of Plato, when he had become captivated by the idea that geometrical shapes and mathematical relations could hold the secret to the universe. Today, he concluded, the “particles of modern physics are representations of symmetry groups and to that extent they resemble the symmetrical bodies of Plato’s philosophy.”39 Plato’s fundamental questions, he mused, had perhaps found their answer in “the contemporary physics of elementary particles.”40

Back in the United States, a physicist and Nazi hunter who had known him since the golden years, when the young man who looked like a simple farm boy had revolutionized physics, volunteered to pen his obituary. Spent of his vitriol over so many years, Samuel Goudsmit would write of his onetime idol, onetime enemy, that he was “a very great physicist, a deep thinker, a fine human being, and

269

also a courageous person.”41 The man who had lost his parents to the Nazis, who had spent half his life investigating their murderers, had found the grace to rise above his rage.

when heisenberg decided to stay in Germany; when he decided initially to ignore or overlook the Nazis’ brutish policies; when he saw what they were doing but decided to focus on the beauty of the science he was doing; when he cooperated with an evil regime in order to protect his work and that of his team— in some ways he was demonstrating precisely the cautious, wait-a nd- see attitude that served him so well as a scientist. Heisenberg was never one to let prior beliefs, or indeed deeply held principles, get in the way of evidence. And yet, if there was ever a time to jettison such a predilection, it was Germany in the 1930s. That he didn’t do so invites our scrutiny, perhaps even our opprobrium, just as it did Goudsmit’s.

But Goudsmit changed his mind.

Which Samuel Goudsmit was right? The one who judged Heisenberg a hypocrite who later covered over his own incompetence with moral superiority, or the one who forgave Germany’s greatest scientist and praised his courage? This question, the very idea that Goudsmit was right at one time and wrong at another, has the virtue of laying bare an assumption common to both science and morality. That assumption is that things happen independently of our knowledge of them and that people’s decisions and actions have a moral value in their own right.

Thankfully, for many of our practical purposes this assumption works just fine. David Mermin’s witticism notwithstanding, we can be confident that the moon does not vanish when we cease to look at it. The Spirit of St. Louis most certainly did take a path after leaving New York and before being sighted again in the skies over Europe. Likewise, if you embezzle from your company or cheat on your spouse, your responsibility for those crimes or betrayals does not depend on their learning about it. And just as the uncertainty

270

Heisenberg discovered at the edges of scientific perception is utterly irrelevant to our tracing a plane’s path on a map, we can and should brush aside any facile reference to his ideas when talking about, say, the reality of an accused person’s actions and intents, or the meaning of a work of art.

The trouble comes when we take our common and perfectly acceptable image of reality as an independent space- time in which things are happening in blissful disregard of our knowledge and start applying it where it doesn’t belong: below the limits of observability or beyond the very borders of existence itself; between the links of the mechanistic causal chain enabling a human action; or to the very sense of self underlying that action. When we do so, we sacrifice the core of what has made the scientific method so extraordinarily successful: its profound humility; its awareness that our knowledge is always subject to revision, to improvement. Moreover, when we do this, we err profoundly about human agency and freedom, either erasing it along with all responsibility in a vain attempt to understand humans “scientifically” or projecting at the core of all decisions a purely rational agent, utterly transparent to itself as it navigates life’s choices.

As we steer a course through the river of our lives, we are affected by innumerable forces, the vast majority unknown to us. By some accounts this makes of our freedom an illusion, for how can we purport to freely choose when we can’t even see a fraction of the legion of influences acting on us, limiting our movements, sparking our appetites? The threat this picture poses to traditional notions of agency suggests a counternarrative. There must be some part of us that floats above the river, untouched by its waters and therefore utterly free and totally responsible for our every turn. But both these pictures are misleading, and for the same reason. Our freedom, and hence our responsibility for the choices we make, is neither a thing to look for in our material existence nor some ghostlike essence unmoored from that existence. Rather, it is a necessary postulate for a being who can imagine having chosen differently, the condition

271

of possibility of conceiving of that life as one possible path among many.

As Goudsmit sat across the table from Heisenberg at his first debriefing in Heidelberg, he looked into the eyes of a man he believed had chosen poorly. This man had an opportunity to leave, an opportunity not to serve a regime that killed millions of people, that murdered Goudsmit’s own parents. Over the years as the two men engaged in heated debate, Goudsmit must have felt he knew the path of Heisenberg’s soul, felt he could see his fear of losing his position, see his willingness to make a bomb, if only he could. But he couldn’t see these things.

When we judge the actions or intentions of another person, we never have access to their thoughts, never actually see the world from their eyes. We construct an image of their intentions, and then forget we made it. But like an experimenter measuring an event, what we find out pertains to us. It is the product of a relation, the way some part of nature manifests itself to us.

Ultimately, to judge the guilt or rectitude of another’s choices is not to know the secrets of that person’s heart; it is to consider what I would have done, what I should have done, had I been in that person’s shoes. Indeed, to judge another person is to raise for oneself the question of the path not taken. It is to imagine another life and compare it with one’s own. It is nothing more, and nothing less, than the existential burden of one who is free to choose, and to regret those choices. As he sat down to write his obituary, Samuel Goudsmit couldn’t know how Werner Heisenberg judged his own life and choices, but in the end he seemed to realize that such knowledge was not his goal. The absolution he gave wasn’t for Heisenberg. It was for himself.
6 POSTSCRIPT | The Rigor of Angels: Borges, Heisenberg, Kant, and the Ultimate Nature of RealityPOSTSCRIPTQuantum theory is the victory of science over the presuppositions that make science possible. That its findings still register such shock manifests how deeply those presup-positions take root. The physicist Carlo Rovelli puts it this way as he outlines what he calls the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics: “If we imagine the totality of things, we are imagining being outside the universe, looking at it from out there. But there is no ‘outside’ to the totality of things. . . . [W]hat exists are only internal perspectives on the world which are partial and reflect one another. The world is this reciprocal reflection of perspectives.”1 Indeed, the alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics I have discussed here— from objective collapse to many worlds—a re, in his words again, “efforts to squeeze the discoveries of quantum physics into the canons of metaphysical prejudice.”2 Those canons of metaphysical prejudice work in mysterious ways. Even as they guide how scientists think about the meaning of their most significant discoveries, they also affect the lives those scientists lead, how they judge their lives, how we all judge our lives.274 By the end of their respective lives, Goudsmit’s interpretation of Heisenberg’s choices had changed. But had Heisenberg changed? Had the person who made those decisions—t o stay in Germany; to work for the Nazis; to do his best for German science; to produce, or not to produce, a weapon— changed as well? We tend to imagine the series of choices an individual makes through the course of her life as if they were the conscious decisions of a completed person, taken in full knowledge of all the options and their respective consequences, both in the present and as they will eventually play out. We do so because what we think about our own and others’ choices always and by necessity emerges from and takes place in a present from which we look back on those moments, reading them as a path through time leading to the here and now. Even when we might consider such a vision naive, we nonetheless imagine it as the more fulsome picture, how things must have happened even if our limited knowledge in the here and now cannot fully reconstruct it.But perhaps— just as Heisenberg put it when explaining electron emissions during those long arguments with Grete Hermann— perhaps our vision of an ultimately knowable human path through space and time isn’t merely problematic because it is incomplete. Perhaps it is per se impossible. Like Funes reconstructing a day in his memory but needing a full day to do so; like the cosmos repeating itself after an unimaginable time but needing a special archangel to notice it; like a man asking if, were he to replace himself, atom for atom, with the person of a murderer, he too would become such a murderer: a perfectly knowable path through space- time utterly contradicts its own presuppositions. Because to register something, anything at all, one must be minimally different from it; one must be in a relation with it.What Borges’s stories, Heisenberg’s discovery, and Kant’s system all reveal is that the assumption underlying this fantasy, the full coincidence of knowing and being, self- destructs on closer examination. On the one hand, to measure something is to differ from it in some minimal but irreducible way, and hence the very condition   	275of knowing anything about the world demolishes the possibility of doing so perfectly. On the other hand, full presence, being truly and completely a part of the flow, requires eradicating such difference, and hence makes knowledge impossible. One can imagine knowing the world perfectly, but only at the cost of being what one knows; or one can imagine being identical with the world, but only at the cost of knowing it. Like what Heisenberg’s most famous principle revealed about momentum and place, we can’t have both.Far from a weakness, however, this fundamental limitation on our knowledge empowers what we have come to call the scientific method. Science works not despite the limitations of our knowledge but because of our willingness to test our theories and accept the results, whether they affirm or contradict what we hope or expect to see. This means that a theory endures only as long as observation and experiment continue to support it. Science can always come up with a new explanation for the world; no knowledge is dogma. And yet, while all scientists accept this fact in principle, unconscious bias abounds. One such bias is what Rovelli called metaphysical prejudice, the belief that reality exists, out there, independent of our interactions with it, and does so in ways that correspond to how we experience human life on earth: smoothly extended in space and successive in time. And this belief, this desire that the world confirm our expectations, is so strong no construct is too wild if it manages to uphold it.The radical incompatibility of being and knowledge also has massive ramifications for our understanding of choice and responsibility. For the scientific dismissal of free will has always depended on the presumption that somewhere, beyond the natural limits on our ability to know, lies a more complete picture in which each particle of our being is determined by its place and momentum in the causal flow of matter through space- time. If we imagined a being in this flow who was perfectly aware of its place, knowing everything down to the atomic level, that being could, in theory, see everything, but it could not choose. Choices happen in space and time. But for such 276 a being— a being at one with the world and aware of it, simultaneously from beginning to end, like the Aleph under the basement stairs— time and space, which require distance, difference, relations to something else, don’t exist.But we are, evidently, not such beings. Unlike such beings we are trapped in what Shakespeare called “the dark backward and abysm of time,” blind to all that hides from us behind spatial and temporal horizons. And as beings thus trapped in the flow, we may simultaneously presume ourselves determined by it and yet still make choices, still be held responsible. Like Robert Frost’s walker in the yellow woods, we pause where the paths fork and peer down one as far as we can, only to lose sight of it as it bends through the underbrush. We feel sorry that we cannot travel both and be one traveler. Indeed, in blatant contradiction to what materialist or religious attacks on freedom conclude, the assumption of mechanistic causality is utterly at peace with the existential blindness that allows for responsibility, for freedom.So, freedom is just ignorance, and nothing else? Not in the slightest. For as Boethius realized as he stared his impending death in the face, his assumption of an omniscient god who knows every step of the path Boethius would take through life emphatically failed to deprive him of his freedom, failed to absolve him of responsibility or credit for his choices, bad or good. The assumption of such knowledge dissolves the very space- time medium in which we swim, and hence for that impossible perspective my future choices take place in an eternal now in which knowing for certain what path I will choose has no more effect on the freedom of my choices than does someone witnessing me as I make those choices. In the same way, the famed paradoxes born of entanglement lose their sting, because my knowledge of a particle’s yet- to- be- measured spin, or of a twin’s choice of beer or whiskey in a galaxy far, far away, has no more effect on either its randomness or the twin’s choice than would the lingering eyes of the god of things on the particles or people who play out their paths and lives in the eternal present of that limitless mind. 	277In some cases, one knows what one does. In the Garden of Forking Paths, you may pull the trigger knowing full well which path you are choosing. In other cases, even the one deciding doesn’t know why. One physicist leaves; another stays. Those decisions are made and replayed, over and over, as an ever- changing self evolves. To say so isn’t to invite infinite apology, to grant clemency to all acts. It is, rather, to grasp that the very nature of an entity in time, from the evanescences we call particles up to those massive collections of particles known as humans, always and only exists as a relation. Just as every measurement involves an interaction and creates a reality exclusive to those parties involved, every individual creates a life that comprises myriad relations. The relations don’t bloom between previously pristine individuals; rather, like the particles our measurements detect, the individuals spring forth from the relations themselves.In short, despite our dearest desires and most desperate dreams, we are finite. That we can only ever understand things in relation to one another means that understanding will always stem from a limited perspective. Our reason propels us to incredible heights— understanding the fundamental components of matter and laws of the universe, seeing almost to the edges of the cosmos and the beginning of time. But it also leads us woefully astray. For the very ability we have to map our world and hence see our way through the dark also treats that map as though it were the world, and hence drapes a new veil over our enlightened eyes.“Metaphysical prejudice”: the perfect term to describe that magical thinking that Borges, Heisenberg, and Kant each explored, engaged with, and ultimately undid. Quantum theory may not gird us against metaphysical prejudice, but we cannot fully grasp its meaning while maintaining that prejudice. And thus, the persistence of its apparent paradoxes serves as a powerful reminder of how deeply set, how necessary to our thinking those prejudices are. When we see an effect, we reach for a cause, out there, in a world that is ubiquitous in space and durable in time, because we know, 278 just know, that is how the world must be. We know so, but we are wrong. There is rigor there, indeed. But to see that we are the chess masters who made it, we must let the angels go. And that, it seems, is the hardest task of all. 

7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS | The Rigor of Angels: Borges, Heisenberg, Kant, and the Ultimate Nature of RealityACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis book is the product of more than twenty-fi ve years of thinking, teaching, and writing about cosmology, literature, and philosophy. I first started thinking about Dante’s cosmos in a seminar at Stanford taught by Jeffrey Schnapp during which I read Bob Osserman’s book Poetry of the Universe and Mark Peterson’s article “Dante and the 3-S phere” and was inspired to start studying medieval conceptions of curved space. More recently I have taught some version of a course called the Cosmic Imagination to my students at Johns Hopkins on at least several occasions, most recently in the fall of 2022 to a marvelous group of freshmen. I am grateful to all of them for their ever-p resent curiosity. I am also grateful to the many friends and colleagues who looked at all or some of the manuscript during its gestation or interacted with me at conferences or lectures I have given. These include Robert Davidson, Marcelo Gleiser, Brian Greene, Robert Pogue Harrison, Virginia Jewiss, Robert Leheny, Karen ní Mheallaigh, Yi-P ing Ong, Gordon Rubenfeld, and Robert Rynasiewicz. My wife, Bernadette Wegenstein, played an outsize role in commenting on the manu-280 	Acknowledgments script and helped scour the archives for details that helped bring the characters to life. Special thanks go to my agent, Michael Carlisle, whose early guidance helped me form the conception for the book, and to my editor Edward Kastenmeier, who always knew just the right questions to ask. I also want to thank Andrew Weber, who, along with the late and greatly missed Dan Frank, acquired the book for Pantheon. As always I owe a great debt of thanks to Troy Tower, whose meticulous eye and gargantuan research abilities helped assemble the back matter stemming from multiple disciplines and more than ten languages. Finally, I am forever grateful to a friend, among the truest, who read every word, often multiple times. At his own request he remains unnamed.

Very recent research has shown that changes in quanta can be continuous and predictable. Vitally, however, the experimental conditions for this to happen require “continuous observation,” and hence allow for “the reconciliation of the discreteness of countable events, such as jumps, with the continuity of the deterministic Schrödinger’s equation”; see Minev et al., “To Catch and Reverse a Quantum Jump Mid- flight,” 203.Williamson, Borges, 143, 507n21.Ibid., 143.Williamson, “Borges in Context,” 208.Borges, El tamaño de mi esperanza, 130, translation from Williamson, Borges, ix.Borges, El idioma de los argentinos, 47, translation from Williamson, Borges, 148.Andrés, Palabras con Leopoldo Marechal, 24, translation from Williamson, Borges, 149.Schlosser, Kleine Schriften, 1:29, translation from Epstein, Genesis of German Conservatism, 79.Hamann, Briefwechsel, 4:196, translation altered from Kuehn, Kant, 241.Translation from Williamson, Borges, 156.Borges, El idioma de los argentinos, 24, 20, 23, translation from Williamson, Borges, 157.Borges, El idioma de los argentinos, 24, translation from Williamson, Borges, 158.Pauli, Wissenschaftlicher Briefwechsel, 1:347, translation altered from Lindley, Uncertainty, 145. 282 W.

I begin with his second, the mathematical antinomy of atomism; then pass to his fourth, the dynamical antinomy of necessity; then to his first, the mathematical antinomy of space and time; and, finally, to his third, the dynamical antinomy of causality.1.

In fact, it is a stunned Aristotle who is left to reply, “It looks that way.” While it’s not possible that the Aristotle we know today was present for the meeting of Socrates with Zeno and Parmenides, Plato gives that name to the young student who agrees to be Parmenides’s foil, and adds, “the man who would later be one of the Thirty,” referring to his own academy; Plato, Opera, 2:127d, translation from Plato, Parmenides, 361. It is probable that Plato did this in part because he noticed how struck his own student Aristotle was by Zeno’s arguments. Indeed, while Zeno’s book itself is lost, we know about it and his paradoxes because Aristotle deals with them in great detail in his Physics, which would go on to become one of the central sources for Scholastic science.Aristotle, Physics, 180 (bk. 6.9, col. 239b), as quoted in Hegel, Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie, 1:296; the rather loose translation is from Hegel, Greek Philosophy to Plato, 274.Plato, Opera, 2:152b, translation from Plato, Parmenides, 384.Plato, Opera, 2:152c– d, translation from Plato, Parmenides, 385.Kant, Gesammelte Schriften, 4:221, translation from Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, 417.Kant, Gesammelte Schriften, 3:345, translation from Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, 517 (A502): “I do not find that this charge can be justly lodged against him.”Hegel, Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie, 1:292, translation from Hegel, Greek Philosophy to Plato, 271.Hegel, Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie, 1:297, translation from Hegel, Greek Philosophy to Plato, 275.Hegel, Greek Philosophy to Plato, 263, recalling Diogenes Laertes (bk. 9).The philosophically inclined reader might have realized by now that my interpretation is deeply indebted to the thought of Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida, even if neither plays a starring role in this account.See Martin Hägglund’s brilliant exposition of this idea in This Life. 3.

Heisenberg, Physics and Beyond, 123.While Heisenberg continued to believe that modern physics had moved the needle on what counted as a priori in terms of our ability to know, his interactions with Hermann and Weizsäcker clearly had an effect. He told Bohr as much in a letter shortly after the visit, and he would go on to write in an article the following year that Kant’s forms of intuition and the law of causality underlay every experiment in modern physics, and indeed without them no inference concerning the properties of observed objects could ever be made. See W. Heisenberg, Physics and Beyond, 123; and Camilleri, Heisenberg and the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, 142– 43.Weizsäcker himself was critical that Cassirer had gone too far down the road of logical empiricism, hence sacrificing much of what Kant’s thought had enabled; see Camilleri, Heisenberg and the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, 143. Indeed, as Stephan Körner writes in his introduction to Cassirer’s timeless exposé of Kant’s life and thought, many philosophers believed and continue to believe that the discoveries of general relativity and quantum mechanics were “incompatible with the Kantian a priori principles of causality and continuity”; Körner, “Introduction,” ix– x.W. Heisenberg, Physics and Philosophy, 90.Ibid., 64.Ibid., 101. And yet even while overlooking that Kant had, in fact, foreseen the very paradox that quantum mechanics codified, when considering the question of the shape of the cosmos, Heisenberg saw that same paradox in its cosmological version and called it by its name, antinomy. See ibid., 124: “Space cannot be finite, since we cannot imagine that there should be an end to space; to whichever point in space we come we can always imagine that we can go beyond.” Having recognized the antinomy of the edge of the universe, Heisenberg would need only to connect the dots to see that the wrench in the wheel of full correspondence between quantum mechanics and Kant’s system was, in fact, already part of that system.W.

11 a note on the text | The Rigor of Angels: Borges, Heisenberg, Kant, and the Ultimate Nature of Realitya note on the textThis book was set in Sabon, a typeface designed by the well- known German typographer Jan Tschichold (1902– 74). Sabon’s design is based upon the original letter forms of sixteenth- century French type designer Claude Garamond and was created specifically to be used for three sources: foundry type for hand composition, Linotype, and Monotype. Tschichold named his typeface for the famous Frankfurt typefounder Jacques Sabon (c. 1520– 80).Typeset by Scribe, Inc., Philadelphia, PAPrinted and bound byDesigned by Jo Anne Metsch
