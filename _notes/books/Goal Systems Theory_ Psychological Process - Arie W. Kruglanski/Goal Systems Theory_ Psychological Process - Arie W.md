# Goal Systems Theory

“This book is a celebration of over 20 years of theoretical and empirical work studying Goal Systems Theory. It is well worth celebrating. The initial ambitious vision for this theory was to revise the study of motivation, and, impressively, it has done just that. It is extremely rare for a theory to have the breadth and depth displayed here. We used to call such theories ‘Grand’, and the research and ideas discussed in this book are grand indeed. And inspiring. This is a milestone that is must reading for anyone interested in motivation science.”

—**E. Tory Higgins**, Professor of Psychology, Columbia University, Author of _Beyond Pleasure and Pain: How Motivation Works_

“Do you have more than one goal? Then this book is for you! Like the stars in the sky, goals wax and wane, harmonize, conflict, or live next to each other. Diving into this volume summarizing the unique research on goal systems, will give you access to a new universe of discovery and surprise, of guidance and practical advice. A uniquely fruitful collaboration of world-leading scientists over the past two decades will lead you through their research journey into the sky of goal systems.”

—**Gabriele Oettingen**, Professor of Psychology, New York University, Author of _Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside the New Science of Motivation_

“Pursuing goals is one of the most universal and basic human activities. In this exceptional book, leading experts summarize their contributions to Goal Systems Theory, grappling with diverse and fascinating aspects of how people think about, select, desire, manage, and achieve (or fail to achieve) their goals. This book covers the latest and most creative work in the field. It is an indispensable resource for anyone interested in human goal pursuit—which is to say, anyone interested in human motivation.”

—**Roy F. Baumeister**, Professor of Psychology University of Queensland

“Goal psychology is emerging as a hub of many areas of scholarship in the behavioral and social sciences. Goal Systems Theory has ushered a paradigmatic reorientation of this field by uncovering the means-end architecture of the systems of individuals’ goals. This timely book presents a comprehensive and integrative review of the important lessons learned over the last two decades from research inspired by Goal Systems Theory. The diverse programs of research by the contributors to this book, renowned motivation science scholars, attest to the explanatory power of Goal Systems Theory and its rich implications for the betterment of individual and societal functioning. I recommend this authoritative book as a valuable resource for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, as well as researchers and practitioners in psychology and the social sciences.”

—**Yaacov Trope**, Professor of Psychology, New York University

“Goal Systems Theory has been an especially generative model of motivation for the field of psychology in general and for me in particular. Commemorating two decades of research, this volume stands as testament to this theory’s breadth of influence as well as a harbinger of advances to come. Required reading for anyone who wants to know why and how people pursue the goals they do.”

—**Angela Duckworth**, Professor of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania, Author of _Grit_

“_Goal Systems Theory_ is a marvelous compilation of essays that will help readers better understand, navigate, and achieve their multiple goals. Whether you’re a scholar of motivation interested in the latest research or a curious novice ready to learn about goal systems from the world’s experts, this book is for you.”

—**Katy Milkman**, Professor of Business at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of _How to Change_

“Goal Systems Theory is the most important advance in decades in our understanding of human motivation. It revolutionizes classic ideas such as intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, how people juggle multiple goals, and the relation between means and goal outcomes. This volume presents novel directions and the latest research on goal systems, explaining political extremism, risk taking, flow, problem solving, and identity. It is simply a must-read for all social and behavioral scientists as well as anyone interested in why people do what they do. I can’t overstate the significance of this book.”

—**Wendy Wood**, Professor of Psychology and Business, University of Southern California, Author of _Good Habits, Bad Habits: The Science of Making Positive Changes that Stick_

“Goal Systems Theory is among the towering achievements of twenty-first-century motivation science. Its power was readily apparent upon publication of the landmark 2002 paper introducing the theory, and yet its influence has grown in ways that were hard to fathom at the time. This essential book captures the power and scope of the theory across domains ranging from attitudes to problem-solving, from risky behavior to extremism. These chapters are required reading for anybody seeking to understand the nature of goals, motivation, or self-regulation.”

—**Eli Finkel**, Professor at Northwestern University and author of _The All-Or-Nothing Marriage_

The Principles of Goal Systems Theory

Ayelet Fishbach, Catalina Kopetz, and Arie W. Kruglanski

In the fall of 2021, between two waves of the COVID pandemic and university closures, a group of people who study goal systems theory (GST) met at the University of Chicago to discuss ongoing research and exchange ideas on where to go next with the research.

The story of this group started more than 20 years before the Chicago meeting. In the fall of 2000, Arie met Ayelet at the University of Maryland in College Park. He was an established professor and a world expert on research on motivation and cognition. She was a postdoc who wrote her dissertation on self-control. In their first meeting, Arie expressed his vision that their group would revise the study of motivation. Ayelet thought it would be nice if they published a paper.

They started working on what they initially referred to as “goal networks.” In just a few months, the group, which included Arie, Ayelet, James Shah, Ron Friedman, Woo Young Chun, and David Sleeth-Keppler, published a paper titled “A Theory of Goal Systems.” It came out in 2002]], and for many of us, it marked the beginning of long and productive research programs that supported, expanded, and applied the original GST (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]).

The following year, a new graduate student arrived at the lab. Arie handed Cata the GST paper and invited her to work on multifinality (a concept that, as an international student, she could barely pronounce). Cata found the group’s enthusiasm about the new theory contagious, and she soon became a true believer in GST and an enthusiastic researcher of multifinality.

Our team was intrigued by what we found, curious about what we have yet to find, and generally busy uncovering the relationships between goals and means and the implications of these structures for motivation.

None of us could have predicted the breadth of discoveries that GST would inspire in the 20 years that followed. We were clueless about the relevance of our work and the number of questions that were inspired by it and that would still occupy the field of motivation more than 20 years later. This book is a celebration of the work in motivation science that was and is inspired by GST.

### GST

A theory offers a set of general principles that explain some empirical observations or phenomena. At times, the phenomenon begs an explanation. Humans asked about the origins of diseases thousands of years before Louis Pasteur offered an answer articulated in his work on germ theory. Other times, the theory informs us what phenomena might exist and what to watch for. Because we have heard of cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957]]), we expect people who supported a political candidate to feel more (and not less) committed when this elected politician’s performance fails to meet the general expectations of a person who holds a public office.

GST was originated to explain why people pursue the goals they pursue the way they pursue them. Why, for example, does one person find personal meaning in planting a garden while their neighbor travels the world for that same purpose? And why do some choose political extremism while others do not even bother to vote in a democratic election? Beyond goal selection, what guides people’s choice of means, that is, the activities or objects they choose to facilitate their goals? Why, for example, do some health-conscious individuals eliminate junk food from their diet while others sign up for the gym?

When there are multiple goals, research on GST asked when do people prioritize one goal over others, and when do they seek a compromise between goals? When there are different means to achieve a goal, GST research asked how people prioritize these means. When will pursuing one means substitute for another? For example, when will healthy eating substitute for exercising? In contrast, when will means complement each other such that pursuing one makes pursuing another means more likely? To address these questions, GST offers several principles and goal configurations.

### The Principles of GST

An efficient motivational system operates to maximize goal attainment. The first principle of GST is: _People want to pursue actions, choose objects, and relate to others who help them achieve more goals without compromising any of these goals_. For example, people prefer healthy food that is tasty and cheap and a job that is interesting and supports them financially.

Yet, at times people choose the means that achieve less. They might prefer a pen that is just a pen instead of one that is also a laser pointer (Zhang et al., 2007]]). They might even choose a means that undermines other goals. People sometimes choose a risky activity (e.g., substance abuse) to promote their social status because, rather than despite, the fact that it undermines their physical health (Kopetz et al., 2019]]). People behave as if they do not always prefer the means that maximize goal attainment.

The reason for these observed anomalies is the second principle of GST: _The number of goals that a given means serves and the number of means that are connected to a given goal are negatively related to the strength of a given means–goals link_. For example, if biking serves both commuting and exercising, it will be less strongly connected and, hence, appear less instrumental for either commuting or exercising. By the principle of maximizing attainment, a person may spend hours on the exercise bike at the gym and yet commute to work by car. Even more so, most gym-goers choose to park their car closer to the entrance to minimize the walk.

This second principle implies that the configuration of a goal system—the number of means that serve a goal and the number of goals served by a means—will determine activity selection. Specifically, GST offers four basic goal configurations.

#### Equifinality

_Equifinal_ means all serve the same goal and can therefore substitute for each other. This structure is best captured in the idiom “all roads lead to Rome.”

Equifinal means often seem redundant. Why would a traveler need more than one way to get to Rome? Yet, equifinal means form a backup plan. When people are presented with several equifinal means to a goal, they feel more confident that they can reach the goal. Hence, the mere presence of these means increases the goal commitment.

On the downside, the presence of equifinal means dilutes the cognitive association between the activity and the goal it serves, resulting in less transfer of properties such as commitment and positive experience from achieving the goal to pursuing the means (Fishbach et al., 2004]]). Ultimately, when several activities serve the same goal, we should expect lower intrinsic motivation to engage in any of these activities (Kruglanski et al., 2018]]).

#### Multifinality

_Multifinal_ means achieve more than one goal. This is best captured in the (less famous, more animal-friendly) idiom “feeding two birds with one scone.” Multifinal means maximize attainment, and therefore they should be superior. In principle, getting more for the same unit of effort should always be the dominant choice. Even if a person does not care for the additional benefits (e.g., they only wanted to feed one bird), they should not oppose it either.

Take the example of kosher food. If a person learns that some food is kosher, they should either see it as a benefit (i.e., if they observe the Jewish tradition) or not; but this information should not undermine their interest in that food. And yet it does. In a classic demonstration (Simonson et al., 1993]]), presenting information on the status of an ice cream as kosher reduced consumers’ interest in it. They concluded that it was less flavorful.

Indeed, people often prefer means that achieve fewer goals. The children in Lepper et al.’s (1973)]] studies on overjustification were less interested in expressing themselves through drawing after they learned that drawing is not only a means for self-expression but can also win them a reward. And children as young as 3 years inferred that food that was said to make them strong cannot be delicious, so they had little of it (Maimaran & Fishbach, 2014]]).

#### Unifinality

_Unifinal_ means achieve only one goal. If only a single road led to Rome, it would have been unifinal. Unifinal means are less efficient but offer one advantage—they are strongly associated with the single goal that they help achieve. As a result, people are often highly intrinsically motivated to pursue their unifinal means. In this way, the disadvantage of equifinal means is the advantage of unifinal means.

#### Counterfinality

_Counterfinal_ means achieve some goals while undermining others. For example, a homemade lunch may be healthier than dining out, but it undermines a person’s goal to socialize with colleagues over lunch at a restaurant. Counterfinal means are often non-optimal. Instead of maximizing, they minimize attainment. They are the opposite of multifinal means.

Yet counterfinal means may seem more instrumental for the goal that they facilitate exactly because they inhibit another goal. When a Canadian pharmaceutical company advertised its cough syrup as “it tastes awful and it works,” the message was that because this cough medicine undermined the taste goal, it was more instrumental for the goal of getting rid of the cough. Indeed, people often prefer counterfinal means, and those who have high need for cognitive closure are even more likely to display this preference (Kramer et al., 2012]]).

### Research Inspired by GST

The principles and configurations of goal systems helped us explain many of the anomalies we observed in activity selection. Moreover, they inspired us to make new predictions for phenomena we did not know existed. One of the earlier examples comes from research on self-control. We predicted that temptations might be cognitively associated with the goals that override them. For example, to watch their weight, people should abstain from high-calorie foods. So, we predicted and found that dieters associate “chocolate” and “cake” with “dieting” (Fishbach et al., 2003]]). It was Arie and Ayelet’s first empirical publication, coauthored with Ron Friedman.

In another paper, Cata, Ayelet, and Arie found that people who watched their weight chose healthier foods mainly when no other goals (e.g., food enjoyment, alleviating hunger) were salient and important. However, when alternative goals become relatively more salient and important (e.g., people were hungry), the weight-watching goal lost its pull so that people ate less healthy food (Köpetz et al., 2011]]).

The chapters in this book describe research that the principles and configurations of GST inspired. These chapters illustrate how having a theoretical framework helped to predict phenomena we did not know existed as well as explain what we often observed but were not sure why.

### A Peek into the Discoveries in This Book

The essays included in this book cover part of the recent research in GST. They connect research in motivation to the basic topics of psychological research, including identity, persuasion, problem-solving, and political extremism, among others. They further advance motivation theory by addressing topics such as intrinsic motivation, resource allocation, and means choice.

In Chapter 1]], Kruglanski explores several new directions in goal systems research, including identifying that political (and other) extremism stems from _motivational imbalance_, a state in which a given need dominates other basic concerns, and that intrinsic motivation stems from a psychological fusion between a goal and a means. Importantly, Kruglanski argues that one basic need—the need for social significance—underlies many of the goals that people pursue (from finding romance to political extremism).

In Chapter 2]], Kopetz and Starnes explore risk behavior. They argue that risk-taking is not irrational; neither does it represent self-regulatory failure. Instead, risk behavior is a means to a goal. For example, the appeal of substance abuse for adolescents (prior to addiction) comes from the perception that certain substances signal high social status and belonging to the group. By their analysis, risk behavior often results in focusing on one goal and the inhibition of alternative considerations for health or safety.

In Chapter 3]], Woolley and Fishbach return to intrinsic motivation and explore the means-ends fusion model of intrinsic motivation. According to this model, intrinsic motivation results from the strong association between an activity (means) and its end goal; it occurs when the means and the ends collide. They explore the antecedents of means–ends fusion and its consequences for adherence to work, health, and academic goals.

In a related line of research, Melnikoff, Carlson, and Stillman explore flow in Chapter 4]]. This chapter provides a goal systems analysis of psychological flow. Building on the notion of means–end fusion, the authors offer an information theory of flow, according to which learning tasks that induce the strongest goal–means association are more effective at generating flow and, consequently, learning.

Goals are not static, and neither is the process of pursuing them. In Chapter 5]], Huang explores the temporal dynamics of goal pursuit. Her temporally dynamic goal pursuit model explains how various factors (e.g., the number of equifinal means) influence motivation at the beginning versus middle versus toward the end of a goal. Motivation is a function of expectancy and value, yet expectancy matters more at the beginning of goal pursuit, while value matters more once expectancy has been established. It follows, for example, that having multiple means matters more at the beginning of goal pursuit, when people are less confident they can do it, than later, when their confidence and commitment are established.

In Chapter 6]], Shaddy explores resource allocation in goal systems. He argues against the common perception that people invest resources only in means to a goal. Instead, he documents instances where people can invest both indirectly in the means and directly in the goal and that people prefer to invest in goals. He then explores how the architecture of goal systems and the characteristics of the individuals involved both influence resource investment.

Chapter 7]] explores variety among means. Etkin describes the relationship between equifinal means to a goal, asking how actual and perceived variations among means to a goal influence motivation. She further explores means variety as an end in itself.

Goal systems have important implications for attitude research and persuasion, which are topics Schumpe explores in Chapter 8]]. She explains how GST helped develop persuasion techniques. For example, the principle of counterfinality (e.g., presenting a mouthwash that causes burning sensation) inspires persuasion appeals that emphasize rather than hide the fact that a product that facilitates one goal also inhibits others. Similarly, multifinality (adding a goal), equifinality (adding a means), and contrafinality (adding a means that undermines the goal) offer distinct persuasion techniques.

In Chapter 9]], Laurijssen and Leander explore means substitution. When goals are disrupted, we should expect people to switch to a different means or goal. Unlike Etkin’s analysis of choosing between equifinal means, this chapter is about finding a route after the original one was frustrated. The authors present a shifts–jumps–leaps perspective of means substitution, which distinguishes between three qualitatively distinct types of shifts: shifts between means within a current goal domain, jumps to other domains, and leaps of faith into unexpected or new directions. They next explore implications for the frustration-aggression phenomena and how shifts can produce aggressive responding.

Chapter 10]] discusses implications of GST to problem-solving. Converse analyzes what theory on problem-solving can gain by incorporating motivation theory to its analysis. He highlights a key difference between a goal and a problem, which is that a problem lacks a representation of the appropriate means and their relationship to overriding goals. A problem arises when the goal system is incomplete. Converse specifically addresses how viewing problem-solving through a goal systems lens sheds new light on _elements_—the components of problem-solving—and _processes_—the generic problem-solving cycle.

Chapter 11]] explores extremism. Szumowska, Kruglanski, and Kopetz propose that motivational imbalance, in which one need dominates over the others, releases pursuit of activities that would not be considered if the person was considering their entire set of goals. They use this principle to explain both violent extremism and devoted humanism. They argue that similar principles also explain self-harming behaviors.

In Chapter 12]], Jaśko focuses on political engagement. She identifies how the principles of goal systems explain people’s decision to engage in all sorts of political actions, from signing a petition to risking one’s life for a political cause.

Finally, Chapter 13]] applies GST to the study of identity. In exploring the interplay between these related but distinct areas of research, Touré-Tillery and Gamlin note that both goals and identities are stored in memory in an interconnected, hierarchical structure. The cognitive structures that support goals and identities are further intricately linked. Goal pursuit shapes identities, and identities influence which goals are being pursued and which means are selected in pursuing these goals. These authors’ work specifically demonstrates how goal systems shape identities and how identities shape goal systems.

New Developments in Goal Systems Theory](04_Contents1.xhtml#n0002)

Arie W. Kruglanski

The year 2022 marks a 20-year anniversary of goal-systems theory (GST), which made its debut in a 2002 paper at the Advances in Experimental Social Psychology volume (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]). At a recent conference at the University of Chicago dedicated to this event, colleagues whose work was inspired by the theory presented exciting papers on a wide range of topics attesting to the theory’s usefulness and breadth. These presentations in their complete form constitute the various chapters of this volume. In the present chapter my aim is to review several theoretical and empirical developments in the goal systemic framework that informed the research in my own lab over these last decades. These include further exploration of the constructs of equi- and multifinality, as well as the introduction of a new structural construct, counterfinality, and examination of its implications. They also include a new model of intrinsic motivation based on the structural properties of the GST. Both the structural and allocational properties of the GST are drawn upon in a model of extremism that we have recently presented (Kruglanski, Szumowska, et al., 2021); it identifies a common psychological dynamic that underlies such different types of “extremism” as terrorism, engagement in extreme sports, embarking on extreme diets, extreme love crushes, and extreme humanism. Finally, I tie the concept of goal systems to the fundamental notion of basic human needs and show how this conjunction can be used to understand and modify a wide range of behaviors, including the aggressive response to frustration and romantic love.

### The Architecture of Goal Systems: Equifinality, Multifinality, and Counterfinality

The relations between goals and means can be mentally represented via several different configurations, each with important psychological implications. Three such forms, equifinality, multifinality, and counterfinality, were addressed by work in our lab. _Equifinality_ (see Figure 1.1a]]) refers to the case wherein several means are attached to a given goal such that each of the means can on its own accomplish (is sufficient condition for) goal attainment. _Multifinality_ (see Figure 1.1b]]) represents the case wherein the same means simultaneously serves several goals. _Counterfinality_ (Figure 1.1c]]). Studies addressing these configurations were reviewed at some length in a paper published by Kruglanski et al. (2015)]]. Here, I offer a thumbnail discussion of this work.

Figure 1.1 (a) Equifinality configuration. (b) Multifinality configuration. (c) Counterfinality configuration.

#### Equifinality

A major implication of the equifinality configuration is the possibility of substituting one means for another. This basic motivational concept, immanent already in Freud’s (1920)]] notion of symptom substitution and Lewin’s (1935)]] work on task substitution, was touched upon in several research domains including work on different routes to dissonance reduction (Festinger, 1957]]), different routes to persuasion (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986]]), and different methods of self-esteem maintenance (e.g., Steele & Liu, 1983]]; Tesser, 2000]]), among others.

Substitutability work carried out in our lab examined the effects of multiple means to a goal on commitment to the goal and to the means. This research found that having alternative means to the goal increases goal commitment, while at the same time reducing commitment to each of the separate means (Kruglanski et al., 2011]]). The reduced commitment to the equifinal means is attributable in part to the _dilution effect_—the reduced association strength of a given means to the goal in the presence of alternative such means. Evidence for the dilution effect in the context of the equifinality configuration was obtained in a series of studies by Bélanger et al. (2015)]] and a research program (Dugas & Kruglanski, 2013]]) about commitment to groups viewed as means to social identity.

A series of studies by Etkin and Ratner (2012)]] hypothesized and found that individuals who perceive themselves as having made little goal progress prefer a set of equifinal means that is high in variety as such means carry greater assurance of goal attainment than a homogeneous means set. Finally, Milyavsky et al. (2022) found that personal agency and social assistance can be viewed as alternative means of goal attainment such that reliance on one reduces reliance on the other, with important downstream consequences for people’s social attitudes.

#### Multifinality

The simultaneous presence of several salient goals can lead to goal conflict and require a choice as to which goal to prioritize. But often a means can be found that accomplishes all those goals at once. One may find a job that is interesting, offers good working conditions, and provides an opportunity to serve society. One may cook a dish that is nutritious, tasty, and easy to prepare. On first glance, finding a way to accomplish several goals at once may seem all good and to afford greater value than the pursuit of each goal individually. But there is a downside to this story in that the greater the number of goals connected to a given means, the weaker the connection. In other words, the number of connections to a given entity (goal or means) in a goal system dilutes the strength of the connections. Further, because connection strength is typically construed as instrumentality of the means with respect to the goal, the greater the number of goals that a given means serves, the lower its perceived efficacy in serving those goals.

This dilution effect, mentioned earlier in reference to the equifinality configuration, was first discovered in a series of experiments by Zhang et al. (2007)]]. For instance, in a scenario, a means (e.g., _eating tomatoes_) was related with one goal (e.g., _preventing heart cancer_ or _preventing eye disease_) versus two goals (e.g., _preventing heart cancer_ and _preventing eye disease_), which in turn affected the means’ perceived instrumentality to the goal(s): A means said to serve one goal was seen as more instrumental to that goal than a means said to serve two goals. This effect was replicated in several studies that varied in the contents of the goals as well as in the manner in which those goals were presented (self-generated vs. described by the experimenter). Zhang et al. (2007)]] also varied the similarity (vs. distinctiveness) of the goals to each other and the degree of association of each of the goals to the focal means. The dilution effect was more pronounced when two goals were distinct rather than similar, presumably because similar goals activated each other. Too, the greater the manipulated association between the means and one of the goals, the lesser was the perceived association between the means and the remaining goal.

Zhang et al.’s (2007)]] experimental paradigm was used in a series of studies by Orehek et al. (2012)]], who found evidence for moderation of the preference for unifinal versus multifinal means. Specifically, individuals high on the locomotion tendency (the self-regulatory orientation that constitutes a desire for movement and change) prefer unifinal means, whereas those high on the assessment tendency (the self-regulatory orientation that involves a desire to critically evaluate alternatives) prefer multifinal means. This supported the authors’ hypothesis that high locomotors are particularly affected by the _expectancy_ component of motivation that affords quick progress toward the goal, whereas high assessors are particularly sensitive to the _value_ component that they strive to maximize.

Catalina Kopetz’s doctoral dissertation explored another facet of the multifinality configuration, thus discovering the _multifinality constraint effect_ (Kopetz, 2007]]; Kopetz et al., 2011]]). It has to do with the fact that the simultaneous presence of several active goals exercises constraints on means to those goals such that means that serve some of those goals while undermining others will tend to be avoided. Consider the co-active goals of satisfying one’s hunger, satisfying one’s taste, and taking care of one’s health. This creates a situation in which the selected foods will be those that, while nutritious, are also tasteful and healthy, whereas unhealthy and tasteless foods would be avoided.

Kopetz et al. (2011)]] also investigated the case in which one of the active goals becomes dominant. According to the allocational principle of finite mental resources, this should result in the concomitant withdrawal of resources from the alternative goals, thus weakening the constraints they would normally exercise on means to the dominant goal. In consequence, the consideration set of means to the dominant goal now expands, producing a situation in which nearly “anything goes” that serves the dominant goal, including means that normally would undermine (some of) the alternative goals. I revisit that point at a later juncture when reviewing the GST-inspired work on the psychology of extremism (Kruglanski, Szumowska, et al., 2021).

#### Counterfinality

Those latter means, ones that undermine some goals while serving others, are therefore labeled as _counterfinal_. Often, those means are avoided, especially when the goals they undermine are salient; but occasionally they are even preferred over other means to a goal. Specifically, when one goal becomes dominant and other goals are crowded, the counterfinal means that serve the dominant goal (while undermining other goals) can be particularly attractive. Counterfinality has intriguing psychological properties that “irrationally” enhance its appeal: Such means often are alluring precisely because they are counterfinal. That may be the case because the counterfinal means is perceived as uniquely, and hence particularly strongly, attached to the focal goal (Kruglanski, 1996]]; Zhang et al., 2007]]) and because it brings to mind the “cost heuristic” whereby costs are seen as a proof of efficacy, along the lines of the “no pain no gain” slogan that portrays pain (or cost) as the necessary condition of goal attainment (see Kruger et al., 2004]]; Labroo & Kim, 2009]]). Along these lines, a set of studies by Freund and Hennecke (2015)]] demonstrated that less enjoyable means (and in that sense counterfinal to the goal of enjoyment) were viewed as more instrumental to the goals they were assumed to serve. Another example of this phenomenon is the so-called martyrdom effect whereby people believe that someone who suffers while helping is actually more helpful (Olivola & Shafir, 2009]]).

Schumpe et al. (2018)]] demonstrated the counterfinality effect in five studies. For instance, the more pain people experienced when getting tattooed, the more they perceived getting tattooed as instrumental to the goals of being unique and showing off. And the more counterfinal a consumer product was considered to be (i.e., a “burning oral rinse”), the greater was its perceived effectiveness (in fighting germs). Other studies in the Schumpe et al. (2018)]] series showed that counterfinality resulted in a more positive attitude toward the means and that a simultaneous commitment to both the focal and the alternative goals reduced the preference for the counterfinal means. Research by Catalina Kopetz (see Chapter 2]] in this volume) also demonstrates that risk behavior is perceived as more instrumental to one’s goals, particularly when it is seen as counterfinal.

Because counterfinal means are perceived as particularly instrumental to goal attainment, their attractiveness is more pronounced when the general expectancy of goal attainment is low. In this vein, Bélanger et al. (2015)]] found that individuals high on depression or anxiety who are generally pessimistic about their likelihood (expectancy) of goal attainment exhibit a strong preference for a counterfinal means. Klein (2013)]] found that a goal that was portrayed as difficult to attain (curing severe illness) led participants to prefer a counterfinal (expensive) means more so than a goal that was easier to attain (curing a common cold).

The appeal of counterfinal means may in some cases promote dependency and addiction. Thus, Connor et al. (2011)]] found that individuals who felt that smoking cannabis has negative consequences (e.g., makes them feel insecure) are more dependent on the drug. Similarly, Li and Dingle (2012)]] found on the basis of survey data that beliefs about the negative consequences of alcohol consumption (e.g., being hungover) were positively related to risky alcohol consumption such as binge drinking.

#### The Psychology of Extremism

An important feature of the GST is its breadth and scope. In this way, it affords a prism on a wide variety of phenomena, all of which are governed by the same basic cognitive and motivational principles. A recent example of a GST-derived insight into an important social phenomenon is the application of work on counterfinality and the multifinality constraint effect to the psychology of extremism. In popular parlance, the term _extremism_ has come to signify specifically political violence and terrorism. Yet there are numerous other types of behaviors generally regarded as extreme: extreme diets, extreme sports, extreme (exceptional) humanitarianism, extreme substance or behavioral addictions, etc. A goal systemic perspective allows a common understanding of all those extreme behaviors (for extensive discussion, see Kruglanski, Kopetz, & Szumowska, 2021]]; Kruglanski, Szumowska, et al., 2021). That approach views extremism as based on a motivational imbalance in which a given need dominates other basic concerns. A motivational balance exists where all of the person’s basic needs are in their region of satisfaction. Such well-rounded care for all one’s basic needs defines the state of moderation. A state of motivational imbalance, which gives rise to extremism, occurs where one of the basic needs gains dominance and crowds out other basic concerns. As noted earlier, this liberates the means to the dominant need from constraints exercised by those alternative (and now faded) concerns. The resulting expansion of the consideration set of means to the dominant goal comes to include now counterfinal means, ones that effectively undermine or sacrifice the alternative concerns. As most people attempt to maintain a motivational balance, they refrain from carrying out counterfinal behaviors that sacrifice some of their needs. As a consequence, counterfinal behaviors are typically rare, consistent with their labeling as _extreme_.

Extensive empirical evidence for the proposed motivational imbalance model of extremism is reviewed by Kruglanski, Kopetz, & Szumowska (2021)]] and Kruglanski, Szumowska, et al. (2021). It includes studies attesting to the negative relation between the motivation to pursue dominant versus alternative needs as well as research examining cognitive, behavioral, affective, and social consequences of motivational imbalance. The cognitive consequences included studies of selective attention, inhibition, rumination, projection, and choice expansion (in considered means to the focal goal). Behavioral consequences included increased tendency to choose the counterfinal means when under motivational imbalance and a decreased tendency for such a choice prompted by the restoration of balance. Affective consequences included studies of considerable emotional volatility when under a state of motivational imbalance, the alternation between the proverbial “agony” and “ecstasy.” Finally, the social consequences of motivational imbalance were attested to by the relative infrequency of protracted tendencies to perform counterfinal behaviors and by the status of social deviants accorded to individuals who exhibit such tendencies.

The GST-based work on the psychology of extremism has resulted so far in two conferences on this topic that brought together scholars with diverse interests (from neuroscience to culture) yet sharing in common the focus on extreme behavior and in an edited volume on the psychology of extremism whose chapters describe the varied extremisms and their underlying dynamics (Kruglanski, Szumowska, et al., 2021).

### The Means–Ends Fusion Model of Intrinsic Motivation

Another important application of the GST is to the phenomenon of intrinsic motivation. According to the theory, the links that connect means to goals can vary in strength. And the greater the links’ strength, the more the means brings to mind the goal and vice versa. In fact, when the association between the means and the goal is very high, the two are nearly indistinguishable, or cognitively “fused” with each other. In other words, under such fusion, performance of the activity (the means) is experienced as attainment of the goal, and the activity is perceived as intrinsically motivated, that is, as an end in itself. Based on this logic, Kruglanski et al. (2018)]] defined an intrinsicality continuum that reflects the degree to which the means–end fusion (MEF) is experienced. The MEF theory assumes that fusion is affected by four major factors: (1) repeated pairing of the activity and the goal, (2) uniqueness of the activity–goal connection, (3) perceived similarity between the activity and its goal, and (4) temporal immediacy of goal attainment following the activity. Kruglanski et al. (2018)]] offer evidence for each of the foregoing determinants of intrinsic motivation.

The idea that repeated pairing of a stimulus and a reward results in association between the two has been the mainstay of classical conditioning theory, one of the most robust and well-documented theories in the history of psychology (for review of the relevant evidence, see, e.g., Hilgard & Bower, 1966]]). As a result of classical conditioning, the neutral stimulus acquires motivational value and comes to serve as a secondary reinforcer (e.g., see discussion by Robinson & Berridge, 1993]]), that is, a goal that the animal or the human would then strive to attain.

Kruglanski et al. (2018)]] reasoned that a continuum of intrinsicality reflects the degree to which the activity (the means) is seen as likely to result in goal attainment, the upper bound of which is where the activity is itself perceived as constituting goal attainment. To address this implication of the MEF theory, Zhang et al. (2007, Study 4)]] repeatedly (and subliminally) flashed words related to the goal of strengthening muscles (e.g., _muscle_) concomitantly with a (supraliminal) presentation of a specific means to that goal (i.e., _jogging_). This procedure significantly increased the perceived instrumentality of the means to the goal while concomitantly decreasing the perceived instrumentality of the same means to an alternative goal (increasing blood oxygen). These findings were conceptually replicated in research by Bélanger et al. (2015, Study 4)]].

Strengthening the means–end connection increases the perceived instrumentality of the means to the goal and, in this sense, increases intrinsicality. On the other hand, establishing alternative links between the means and alternative goals or between the goal and alternative means dilutes the strength of a given means–end connection, and hence reduces the means’ perceived intrinsicality. Work reviewed earlier on the dilution effect, in both the multifinality and the equifinality contexts (cf. Bélanger et al., 2015]]; Kruglanski et al., 2011]]; Zhang et al., 2007]]), yields findings supportive of this theoretical implication.

Goal attainment results in positive affect. Therefore, increasing the fusion between the activity and the goal should result in that positive feeling seeping into the activity as well. This prediction of the MEF theory was supported in research by Fishbach et al. (2004, Study 1)]], where participants reported more positive affect toward the activity (means) in a condition where they generated a single versus two means to the goal, the latter known to dilute the means–end connection, and hence to reduce the MEF (Zhang et al., 2007]]).

Other research supportive of the MEF theory is work by Woolley and Fishbach (2018]]; see also Chapter 3]] in this volume), showing that the immediacy with which the goal follows the means increases the degree of the MEF and, hence, the means’ instrumentality/intrinsicality to the goal. Specifically, it was found that receiving the immediate (vs. delayed) reward for performing the experimental task increased experienced enjoyment, interest, and intention to pursue the experimental task in the future—typical effects of intrinsic motivation to an activity (e.g., Deci et al., 1999]]). Similarly, research by Fishbach et al. (2004)]] supported the theoretical implication of the MEF model whereby the magnitude of affect toward the fused activity should be correlated with the magnitude of affect that the goal attainment itself engenders. Specifically, Fishbach et al. (2004)]] found that the affect felt toward the means corresponded more to the affect toward the goal when the two were strongly versus only weakly associated.

Studies also found support for the mediating role of fusion in effects of immediacy on means instrumentality (Woolley & Fishbach, 2018]]) and for the implication that for the fused means to be endowed with qualities that characterize goal attainment, the goal needs to be active in the first place. In short, the MEF model of intrinsic motivation is based on extensive and wide-ranging research concerning its varied implications. In so far as intrinsic motivation toward activities is of considerable importance in multiple domains of human endeavor (e.g., in work, sports, and education), the novel insights that this model provides could prove to be of considerable practical utility.

### Applying the GST to Real-World Phenomena: Current and Future Research Directions

#### On the Origins of Goal Systems. The Origin Question: Where Do Goals Come From?

A fundamental assumption of the GST is that goal systems are hierarchical; that is, all goals actually are means that serve a supreme goal at the apex of the hierarchy. That supreme goal is nothing but a basic psychological need. Psychological theorists from Freud onward (including Deci & Ryan, 2000]]; Fiske, 2010]]; Higgins, 2012]]; Maslow, 1943]]; McDougall, 1908]]) assume the existence of basic biological and psychogenic needs, and from the GST perspective each goal system is “crowned” by a basic need. This suggests that all our goals, at the end of the day, are geared to serve basic needs. The basic needs are the “dogs that wag the tails” of all that we ever do. We assume them to be universal and fixed, part and parcel of “human nature,” the structure of our psyche if you will.

In contrast, the goal systems that serve those needs are fluid and highly variable. They are culture-specific, context-specific, and socially constructed. They are tied to the satisfaction of the basic needs via narratives that are validated by one’s in-group or social network. The need, the narrative, and the network define our 3Ns model of behavior that we believe to be quite general (see Kruglanski, Belanger, & Gunaratna, 2019). In other words, any behavior whatsoever is in service of some need or need combination (the need component of the 3Ns); the satisfaction of that need factor is guided by a narrative that specifies what goals, subgoals, etc. would, in a given situation, serve the need(s) in question; in turn, that narrative is socially validated by a network of significant others, members of one’s in-group. This gives it credibility, and hence the power to guide behavior. Different goal systems can be constructed to satisfy any basic need out of beliefs shared within a network or a community of meaning. This is important because it affords substitution of a given goal system regarded as problematic or undesirable in some sense by another goal system that is more desirable.

According to this analysis, a goal systemic understanding of any behavior should start with identifying the basic need that ultimately drives it. This is the departure point from which one can explore the goal systems that have been or can be constructed to gratify that basic need. So you can always ask what basic need does a given behavior serve? And are there other means that serve the same basic need and that can be substituted for the current behavioral means?

In the past decade or so, my colleagues and I were interested in one such basic need, the need for social significance and worth (arguably, the single most important social need), and examined it empirically in a series of papers in which Pontus Leander, Kasia Jaśko, and other friends have participated, including our comprehensive statement of significance quest theory, now published online in the Perspectives on Psychological Science.

##### Terrorism

We have been studying this need in several contexts starting with the context of terrorism. In the terrorism literature a major question has been that of terrorist motivation: Why in the world do they do it? And terrorism researchers have identified a variety of motivations (the perks of paradise, vengeance, adoration of the leader, feminism). They concluded, therefore, that terrorism is multiply determined. But there is a different, and potentially more useful and parsimonious, way to think about it, namely that these are all means to the same end, satisfaction of the same basic motive, the quest for significance. Take vengeance, for example. Vengeance comes in response to a humiliation or a loss of significance, and by avenging one’s humiliation one regains significance and shows that one too matters and has the power to punish the original offender. Other causes, like the perks of paradise or earning the leader’s appreciation, reflect an opportunity for significance gain.

In multiple studies, we obtained evidence that manipulating the quest for significance or measuring it in various ways promotes behaviors seen as significance-enhancing often through violence. So, in one paper we estimated suicide bombers’ quest for significance by gleaning from open-source data evidence for their loss of significance or ambition for significance gain and found that the stronger the quest, the greater number of people these suicide bombers killed or wounded (Webber et al., 2017]]); and in another study, with members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka, one of the most cruel and determined terrorist organizations in history, we found that the greater the significance gain they experienced from a deradicalization program, including vocational and language courses and other activities allowing them to reintegrate into Sri Lankan society, the greater was their degree of deradicalization, illustrating the substitution of vocational preparation for terrorism as a means to significance gain (Webber et al., 2018]]).

##### Frustration–Aggression

Whereas we have ample published data (see, e.g., Kruglanski, Belanger, & Gunaratna, 2019; Kruglanski, Webber, & Koehler, 2019]]) attesting to the role that the quest for significance plays in violent extremism, our lab is currently pursuing two new topics from the significance quest perspective for which we do not yet have sufficient data: the frustration–aggression hypothesis and romantic love. Our novel analysis of both these issues is firmly grounded in the GST perspective. With respect to the frustration–aggression hypothesis, the question is what logic moved Dollard et al. (1939)]] to come up with the hypothesis that frustration leads to aggression? What basic need does aggression serve? What is the end to which aggression is a means? Why aggression, of all things, in response to frustration? In response, we surmise that aggression is a primitive, primordial means to dominance and that dominance or power is a form of significance or social worth.

This framing suggests several hypotheses: One is that, depending on the narrative, and the network, frustration can lead to other significance-affording responses. In a study that Pontus Leander and his colleagues published recently (Leander et al., 2020]]) we manipulated frustration through failure on an anagram task and then manipulated the norm presumably endorsed by college graduates of whether the United States should intervene militarily in Syria. We found that the frustrated participants more so than the controls tended to go more with the narrative endorsed by the network, whether aggressive or non-aggressive.

A second hypothesis that follows from our analysis is that frustration will elicit an aggressive reaction to the extent that the goal serves the significance quest. Molly Ellenberg, of our lab, recently analyzed the survey responses of a sample of 272 incels (involuntary celibates), men who feel unfairly rejected and mistreated by women. She found support for a mediational model (see Figure 1.2]]) in which an index of significance loss (agreement with items such as “were you ostracized,” “did you have trouble with sports,” “did you face rejection from girls”) predicted an aggressive response toward women, namely agreement with the statements “I sometimes entertain thoughts of violence” and “I would rape if I could get away with it.” This was mediated by agreement with the statement “I admire Elliot Rodger for his Santa Barbara attack.” Notably, Elliot Rodger carried out a misogynistic terror attack in Isla Vista California, in which he killed six people, as well as himself.

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-004-colour.gif)

Figure 1.2 Readiness to commit rape as a function of Significance Loss and approval of Rodger Manifesto.

Gabriele di Cico of our lab recently carried out a different project in which he performed a linguistic analysis on 33,484 posts on the incels.co web forum. Words indicating honor loss had a direct effect on words related to death (indicating aggressive intentions), and the relationship was also mediated by the number of words indicating anger (see Figure 1.3]]).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-005.gif)

Figure 1.3 Relations between Significance Loss words, Death words, and Anger words.

A third hypothesis is that this frustration–aggression relationship will be moderated by the individual’s personal degree of significance quest. Finally, we predict that the frustration–aggression relationship will be moderated by the degree that the culture subscribes to the narrative that violence restores or brings about significance (e.g., an honor culture), that is, the narrative that violence is the means to the end of significance. Research bearing on this hypothesis is presently under way in our lab.

##### This Thing Called Love

Ironically perhaps, the very motivation that leads to aggression could be the main underlying force in its diametric opposite, namely love. People like to think of love as an unfathomable mystery, a matter of fate, magic, or interpersonal chemistry. But our role as scientists is to solve mysteries and explode myths—in other words, to be joy spoilers and make everything seem rational and simple. In this vein, our hypothesis, supported by the way in the writings of the great early prophets of love, the 15th-century Florentine philosopher Marsilio Ficino and the 18th-century thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau, is that love is a means to the basic need of significance. You love someone or fall in love with someone in order to be loved in return, and to be loved is to be truly appreciated as someone very special, that is, to gain immense significance in that relationship.

A GST framing suggests several hypotheses about love. First, a person will fall in love with people who have considerable social worth because being loved by someone worthy is more significance-bestowing than being loved by someone less worthy. We name it the _trickle-down effect_. Second, people will tend less to fall in love with someone if they had alternative means of getting significance. These could be alternative persons (i.e., possible alternative romantic partners) or alternative sources of significance from an entirely different dimension (e.g., power, professional work).

Third, people who experienced significance loss in some domain should be more likely to fall in love than people who did not. Also, fourth, people who lost significance in a different domain would be ready to “lower” their love-falling standards, that is, fall in love with less worthy people (on some dimensions), that is, people less likely to bestow significance upon them. Our lab is presently collaborating on these issues with Ed Lemay, a colleague at the University of Maryland and an expert on close relationships.

In short, we assume that behavior, cognition, and affect are motivated: They are driven by goals that serve basic needs. Because GST is a basic perspective on goal-driven behavior, it affords insights into diverse psychological phenomena, and I found it to be an exceedingly fruitful approach. This is amply attested by the exciting work reported in the remaining chapters in this volume.

A Goal Systems Approach to Risk Behavior](04_Contents1.xhtml#n0003)

Catalina Kopetz and Wesley Starnes

In 2002, Arie Kruglanski and his students and postdocs published the goal systems theory (GST), a theory about how people set and pursue their goals. This volume celebrates the theoretical and empirical developments inspired by GST in the years following its publication. Our chapter explains why we (the authors of this chapter) are celebrating GST in the context of theories in psychology generally, and particularly in the field of motivation. We will argue that GST is one of the few theories in psychology that comes close to what a theory should be: testable, coherent, parsimonious, generalizable, able to explain previous findings while generating new testable implications (e.g., Higgins, 2004]]; Popper, 1935/1959). We support this argument by discussing how GST provides a new and parsimonious perspective on risk behavior, a phenomenon that has been fascinating not only laypeople but mathematicians, economists, and psychologists for decades. We will show how the basic principles of goal pursuit defined by GST explain and integrate previous findings across fields of inquiry and risk behaviors, answer previously unanswered question, and generate new implications for understanding, preventing, and/or changing risk behavior.

### GST and Theorizing in Psychology

Psychology in general, and social psychology in particular, has been criticized for the weakness of its theories. For instance, while he acknowledged the difficulties of theorizing about human behavior, Meehl (1978)]] suggested that our theories are “scientifically unimpressive and technologically worthless” (p. 806), that they “rise and decline, come and go, more as a function of baffled boredom than anything else; the enterprise shows a disturbing absence of that _cumulative_ character” (p. 807, emphasis in original) that characterizes other sciences. At the core of his critiques stands not only the way we test our theories but also their lack of deductive fertility.

Similarly, McGuire (1973)]] criticized both the methodological approach—focus on social relevance and hypothesis-testing—and the theoretical approach that characterized social psychology at the time. He was particularly concerned that we focus on testing simplistic hypotheses rather than trying to formulate and test theories that simulate “the complexities with which the variables are organized in the individual and social systems” (p. 448). He also pointed out that social psychologists are more motivated to “churn out one little study after another” (p. 455) rather than attempting to integrate isolated findings into more meaningful pictures.

By looking at the dates of these references and quotes, one may wonder how relevant these concerns still are. Interestingly, many years later, important social psychology scholars were lamenting about similar issues. Kruglanski (2001)]] noted that we, as a field, are not very comfortable going beyond our data to tracking and evaluating theoretical arguments; we tend to focus on phenomena rather than attempting to discover the underlying principles and mechanisms behind seemingly diverse phenomena. As a consequence, we keep reinventing the wheel and giving new names to old concepts (N. Miller & Pedersen, 1999]]); the field is fragmented (Vallacher & Nowak, 1997]]), with a large number of distinct factors being “invoked to explain different phenomena, fostering a highly differentiated conceptual landscape” (p. 74). In one of his presidential columns, Walter Mischel (2008)]] referred to this as the “toothbrush problem” and suggested that psychologists treat other psychologists’ concepts and theories like toothbrushes—no self-respecting person wants to use anyone else’s, so they get their own. Although amusing, this analogy reiterates the concerns regarding the fragmentation of the field and suggests that this may be one important reason why psychology is not a cumulative science. As Meehl (1978)]] pointed out, in other sciences theories evolve. In psychology, we have a constant supply of new toothbrushes.

Nowhere were these concerns more obvious than in the field of motivation. Motivation and goals have always been a critical concept in psychology (Bruner, 1957]]; Lewin, 1935]]; Jones & Thibaut, 1958]]). Neisser (1967)]] suggested that the person’s intent or goal was the primary determinant of cognition and behavior. Despite the importance of the concept, psychology has been slow to develop major theories of motivation and goal pursuit. Until recently, the concept was vaguely defined; it was considered to be a starting point, an entity without any specifications regarding what particular goal will be in place at any particular point in time (e.g., Kimbel & Perlmuter, 1970; Wilensky, 1982]]). The field was preoccupied with identifying motivation or goal contents such as need for achievement (Atkinson, 1964]]); need for cognition (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982]]); and belonging, understanding, controlling, enhancing, and trusting (Fiske, 2003]]), to name just a fraction of them. Accordingly, people were classified as if in a fixed motivational state, which would then predict a variety of relevant outcomes.

In addition to the focus on motivational contents, the field often implies that some motives were worth pursuing more than others (long-term vs. short-term, health and fitness vs. indulgence, etc.). Difficulty in pursuing these motives was studied as lack of self-control, impulsivity, and self-regulatory failure (e.g., Wagner & Heatherton, 2015]]).

Little attention was paid to the general motivational process. Without clearly defining the goals and specifying when and why people have the goals they do and through what processes they choose among alternative actions, the field ran into what Neisser (1967, p. 292)]] considered to be “the problem of the executive”; a “little man in the head, a homunculus” (p. 295), was responsible for selecting the goals and the corresponding course of action.

This is particularly interesting given that Lewin (1935)]] warned against this approach at the beginning of the 20th century. He lamented that psychology was stuck in an Aristotelian mode of thinking characterized by a tendency to focus on specific phenomena rather than on the general laws of behavior and to classify concepts based on their value rather than according to the nature of the psychological process involved: “a tendency to attack the actual psychological process” (p. 4). Just as Aristotelian thinking distinguishes between heavenly and earthly bodies characterized by the highest forms of motion versus the motion of inferior types, psychology has long distinguished between _normal_ and _pathological_, _errors_ and _true cognition_, _impulsive_ and _deliberative_ thinking characterized by lower- versus higher-order processes such as _automatic_, _associative_ versus _controlled_, _effortful_, _conscious_. Accordingly, the essence of the object or the concept was determined by its classification, and it was assumed to be associated with positive or negative aspects. This tendency or mode of thinking has the consequence of classifying together things with insignificant communalities and separates things that objectively are closely and importantly related. Lewin advocated instead for a Galilean approach, with no value concepts and dichotomies but based on common psychological laws across behaviors and on understanding the dynamic of human behavior at the intersection of multiple forces that may be relevant on a moment-to-moment basis depending on the situation.

The implications of these theoretical shortcomings were not immediately obvious to the first author (Catalina Kopetz) as she was finishing her PhD and starting her postdoctoral training. It was not until she was confronted with the world of (research in) substance use and other risk behaviors that she understood the need for a coherent, parsimonious, and generalizable theoretical framework. It became clear to her that in the absence of such a framework to guide our understanding of major social and behavioral problems—specifically related to the primary causes of mortality such as overeating, smoking, alcohol and substance use, risky sexual behavior (RSB), driving under the influence—we are very limited in providing solutions and run the risk of being irrelevant.

Luckily, her training in the basic principles of goal pursuit provided such a framework. Since 2009, she and her collaborators have worked to demonstrate that an approach based on the principles of goal pursuit can integrate and explain previous findings, address unanswered questions, and generate new implications for understanding, preventing, and/or changing risk behaviors like those enumerated above.

#### How Does GST Address the Issues and Criticism Regarding Theorizing in Psychology and Provide a Relevant Framework to Study Risk Behavior?

1. GST does take a Galilean approach: It focuses on the motivational process rather than the content; it describes the necessary and sufficient principles to understand goal pursuit regardless of the goal content.

2. It acknowledges the complexity of goal-directed action by suggesting that people pursue multiple goals, and it describes how multiple goals and their attainment means are structured with important implications for actions.

3. It is generalizable. As this volume attests, the organizational and motivational principles identified by GST account for multiple aspects of goal-directed action (e.g., goal-setting, means choice, resolution of goal conflict, goal progress, investment in goals and means). More importantly, the same principles apply to understanding a multitude of phenomena such as romantic relationships, gun violence, risk-taking, and extremism. Across all these phenomena, GST offers a parsimonious perspective that integrates and explains previous findings while generating new implications.

### A Goal Systems Approach to Risk Behavior

GST approaches goals as cognition—mental representations of desirable end states interconnected with their means and other goals (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]). By “reuniting” motivation and cognition, GST derives basic cognitive and motivational principles that work together to explain how people set goals and pursue them regardless of the motivational content and across phenomena (e.g., romantic relations, substance use, food choice, or intentions to buy and use guns).

#### Principles of Goal Pursuit

##### Goal Activation

Goals are cognitive representations of desirable end states and, hence, abide by the general principles that govern all cognition including accessibility, interconnectedness between motivational constructs, and dependence on limited cognitive resources (for reviews, see Fishbach & Ferguson, 2007]]; Kruglanski & Kopetz, 2009a]], 2009b]]). Goals can be adopted consciously or arise non-consciously, especially upon exposure to environmental or internal cues cognitively associated with the goal. Much like how the scent of freshly brewed coffee automatically activates the goal of having a cup, exposure to certain sexual cues can automatically activate a corresponding mating goal (Gillath & Collins, 2016]]; S. L. Miller & Maner, 2011]]) and may result in RSB.

##### Means Instrumentality and Means Selection

Goals are cognitively associated with other relevant constructs, such as their means of attainment resulting in different configurations (see Chapter 1]]). When a goal becomes activated, the activation spreads to corresponding means that are believed to be instrumental to goal attainment and stirs individuals to action (Aarts et al., 2001]]; Kruglanski et al., 2002]]). For instance, when experiencing negative affect, people may smoke or drink as a means to feel better (Tice & Bratslavsky, 2000]]).

Means are selected and implemented depending on their perceived instrumentality to one’s goals. The stronger the association between that particular goal and the means is, the more instrumental the means is perceived to be, and thus the higher the likelihood of selecting and implementing it when the goal becomes accessible (Kruglanski, 1996]]; Zhang et al., 2007]]). A variety of cognitive and motivational factors determine both the course of action that the individual deems instrumental at any particular moment as well as the phenomenological experience associated with their choice. The factors include the number of goals and means currently active, the strength of the associations among them, and the value or importance of each goal, which may vary on a moment-to-moment basis.

The number of connections between means and goals determines the strength of each connection; the greater the number of connections, the weaker each single connection (_fan effect_; Anderson, 1983]]; Anderson & Reder, 1999]]). For instance, a means (e.g., eating a salad) that is connected to, or serves, multiple goals (e.g., satiating hunger and losing weight) is generally perceived as less instrumental to either goal (i.e., eating) than another means that is only related to that particular goal (e.g., a burger; Zhang et al., 2007]]). Similarly, if multiple means are connected to a single goal (e.g., running, biking, and swimming as means to one’s fitness goal), each is perceived as less instrumental to the goal’s attainment (Bélanger et al., 2015]]). These notions suggest that the associative strength between a means and its goal(s) follows a constant sum principle (Zhang et al., 2007]]), which has implications for when and why a particular action is perceived as instrumental to one’s goals as well as for preventing and changing behaviors.

###### Counterfinality

People often overestimate the instrumentality of a means to one goal when it is detrimental to other goals. This intriguing aspect of the relationship between goals and means follows from the constant sum principle of associative strength between goals and means; it refers to the phenomenon in which a means becomes perceived as increasingly instrumental to a focal goal to the extent to which it is counterfinal, or it undermines alternative goals (Kruglanski et al., 2015]]; Schumpe et al., 2018]]). Based on the constant sum principle of the association strength between various nodes in a cognitive network, a negative association between a goal and a means increases the connection strength of the remaining goal–means connections in the network. Hence, the counterfinality of a risky behavior to an alternative goal can increase its connection strength to the focal goal—and result in the means being perceived as uniquely instrumental to that goal (Kruglanski, 1996]]; Zhang et al., 2007]]).

###### Transfer of Affect

Behaviors that become associated with successful goal pursuit acquire positive value through _transfer_ of affect (Fishbach et al., 2004]]). The amount of emotional transfer from goals to means and, consequently, the emotional experience of engaging in that particular behavior depend on the importance of the goal that they serve and the strength of the association between the behavior and the goal. For instance, in one study, thirsty participants evaluated items that could satisfy thirst directly (e.g., water and juice) more positively than items that were only moderately instrumental to the thirst-quenching goal (e.g., coffee and beer; Ferguson & Bargh, 2004]]). Thus, one consequence of selecting and implementing a behavior as a means to one’s goals is that behaviors that may be initially neutral or even aversive (e.g., smoking) become desirable; they may be perpetuated or even fuse with the goals (become intrinsically motivated; Kruglanski et al., 2018]]) and may become capable of driving behavior in the absence of the original motivation.

###### Substitution

During goal pursuit, different means that serve the same goal may be substituted for one another (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]). For instance, one could exercise, read a book, or use alcohol to alleviate negative affect. The strength of a given means–goal association may be reduced by the simultaneous presence of alternative means: The higher the number of means associated with a goal, the weaker the association between any particular goal and means and the less likely that any of the means is deemed instrumental and enacted toward goal achievement (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]).

##### Goal Conflict Resolution

Multiple goal representations may become simultaneously activated and may produce competing behavioral tendencies (Kopetz, Hofmann, & Wiers, 2014]]). In such situations, the person may try to find _multifinal_ means that satisfy multiple goals at the same time (e.g., riding a bike for transportation and exercise; Kruglanski, Kopetz et al., 2013]]). When one goal becomes more important than its alternatives, its activation can inhibit competing alternatives (_goal shielding_; Shah et al., 2002]]). Such mechanisms facilitate mobilization and allocation of the resources necessary for goal pursuit (Kruglanski et al., 2012]]).

###### Motivated Distortion

One consequence of goal shielding is that information relevant to goal pursuit is actively distorted to fit with the current motivational state (Bélanger et al., 2014]]). For instance, a smoker may be fully aware of the negative consequences associated with smoking but may actively emphasize the relaxing aspects of the behavior.

##### Mobilization of Resources

Goal pursuit is dependent on resource mobilization and executive control (Botvinick & Braver, 2015]]; Dijksterhuis & Aarts, 2010]]; Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2012]). Resources are mobilized as a function of goal accessibility and importance; this may happen automatically without an individual’s conscious awareness and control (Bijleveld et al., 2009]]; Brehm & Self, 1989]]; Wright et al., 1986]]); resources support people’s goal pursuit by facilitating the processing of relevant information, the implementation of appropriate means, persistence in the face of obstacles, and inhibition of alternative goals and information that may thwart goal attainment.

In what follows, we provide empirical evidence that risk behavior follows the principles outlined above. Our discussion will highlight how these principles allow us to answer previously unanswered questions and to understand how risk behavior is initiated and maintained as well as how it can be prevented and changed.

#### Risk Behavior Follows the General Principles of Goal Pursuit

_Risk-taking_ refers to a choice whose outcomes, positive or negative, are uncertain (Figner & Weber, 2011]]; Holton, 2004]]; Lopes, 1987]]). Laypeople and scientists recognize that risk-taking is a ubiquitous experience crucial to dealing with changing conditions across one’s life span but also with social, environmental, and technological changes (e.g., Beck, 2009]]). However, risk behavior has been mainly studied for its “bad reputation,” or the potential negative consequences associated with it (Beck, 2009]]). As a result, risk behavior has been frequently examined in terms of irrationality, biases in our thinking, impulsivity, or lack of self-control (e.g., Kahneman et al., 1982]]; Reyna, 2004]]; Wagner & Heatherton, 2015]]). However, people have reasons for what they do; their behavior—be it normatively good or bad—responds to their motivations and represents attempts to attain goals. Thus, although risk behaviors may undermine health and safety and may appear irrational from the societal perspective—be it smoking, using drugs, RSB, gambling, or engagement in extreme sports—they also satisfy important goals that the person has in the moment. From this perspective, risk behavior could be understood by applying the basic principles of goal pursuit.

Indeed, previous research as well as research from our lab support the notion that risk behavior, regardless of its form, follows the principles identified by the GST. Specifically, (1) it is enacted when perceived to be instrumental to a goal that is momentarily or chronically active and important, and its instrumentality (and hence likelihood of being selected and enacted) varies depending on the accessibility of alternative means (substitution) or alternative goals that the behavior either serves (multifinality) or interferes with (counterfinality), with behaviors that are instrumental to goal pursuit becoming desirable and possibly perpetuated or even becoming a goal in themselves (transfer of affect); (2) the pursuit of goals, via risk behavior, requires goal conflict resolution and may result in the inhibition of alternative considerations for health or safety, and the inhibition of alternative goals may result in distorted beliefs about the risk behavior that could in turn contribute to its initiation and maintenance; (3) these goal pursuit processes are resource-dependent, such that risk behavior as a means to a goal might increase (rather than decrease) in the presence of cognitive resources for control (see Table 2.1]]).

Table 2.1 The Principles of Goal Pursuit Apply to Understand Risk Behavior Initiation, Maintenance, Prevention, and Change

|Questions addressed|Principles of goal pursuit|Phenomena|
|---|---|---|
|When and why does risk-taking become a means?|Goal accessibility: Goals can be adopted consciously or arise non-consciously upon exposure to cues cognitively associated with the goal.|Obstacles in goal pursuit increase the likelihood of risk behavior.|
|Counterfinality: A means is perceived as increasingly instrumental to one’s goals to the extent to which it interferes with or undermines other goals.|The potential negative consequences of risk behavior might paradoxically increase its perceived instrumentality to one’s salient and important goals.|
|How is engagement in risk-taking perpetuated?|Transfer of affect: Behaviors that become associated with successful goal pursuit acquire positive value.|Risk behavior, as a means, acquires positive value through transfer of affect and becomes desirable itself, able to automatically drive behavior.|
|Why and how is risk behavior initiated and maintained despite potential negative consequences?|Goal shielding: When one goal becomes more important than its alternatives, its activation can inhibit competing alternatives.|The saliency and immediacy of the goal that the risk behavior serves reduce the saliency and importance of alternative goals (e.g., safety, health), allowing for the initiation and maintenance of risk behavior.|
|Mobilization of resources: Active goals mobilize resources that support processing of relevant information, implementation of appropriate means, persistence in the face of obstacles, and inhibition of alternative goals and information that may thwart goal attainment.|Cognitive resources (executive functions) enhance the likelihood of engaging in risk behavior as a means to one’s goal by facilitating (1) inhibition of alternative goals (e.g., health and safety) and (2) distortion of potential negative consequences and an overemphasis of potential benefits.|
|How can risk behavior be prevented and changed?|Substitution: A given behavior’s association strength with a particular goal (and therefore the likelihood to engage in that behavior) decreases when it can be substituted out for some alternative behavior that serves the same end.|Introducing alternative means to the goals that risk behavior serves may decrease the behavior’s perceived instrumentality and therefore the likelihood that it is enacted.|
|Multifinality/goal shielding|Enhancing the saliency and importance of alternative goals such as health and safety could reduce the likelihood of risk behavior. When such goals are chronically accessible, they will constrain people’s behavior and reduce the likelihood of adopting risky behaviors.|

##### Risk Behavior Is Enacted When It Is Perceived as an Instrumental Means to People’s Goals

Risk behavior has often been discussed in relation to a wide variety of goals ranging from basic survival and reproduction needs (Mishra, 2014]]) to social acceptance (Baumeister, 1997]]), prevention-related goals (Scholer et al., 2010]]), achievement goals (Atkinson, 1957]]; Lopes, 1987]]), and regulation of negative affect (Leith & Baumeister, 1996]]; Tice et al., 2001]]). When these goals become accessible, risky options might be considered if they represent instrumental means to goal attainment (Kopetz & Orehek, 2015]]; Kopetz, Woerner, Starnes, & Devukaj, 2019).

For instance, across multiple perspectives people will opt for risky options to deal with loss and restore status quo (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky, 1979]]; Mishra, 2014]]; Mishra & Lalumière, 2010]]; Scholer et al., 2010]]). Men from disadvantaged social and economic backgrounds engage in significantly more risk-taking and criminal conduct (M. Wilson & Daly, 1997]]), whereas people with lower income relative to others are more likely to spend a large portion of their income on gambling behavior (e.g., Blalock et al., 2007]]). However, in line with the notion that risk behavior is enacted only when it is perceived as an instrumental means to one’s goal, it is noteworthy that a state of loss does not necessarily result in risk behavior. Even in a state of loss, risk behavior is not a preferred option for people whose main goal is to move forward rather than to prevent losses and who focus on advancement and gains rather than on losses (Scholer et al., 2010]]; Zou et al., 2020]]).

Drugs are taken to socialize and fit in, to achieve a pleasant drug “high,” to escape an aversive withdrawal “low,” or to cope with negative affect (Kopetz et al., 2013]]). Indeed, the goal of socializing increases the accessibility of alcohol for participants who regularly drink alcohol in social situations (Sheeran et al., 2005]]). When craving is experimentally induced, opiate-dependent participants respond faster to drug-related versus neutral words (Weinstein et al., 2000]]), presumably because drug use represents the most instrumental means to reduce craving and alleviate the negative affect associated with it. Marijuana users report stronger motivation to use marijuana and spending less time reading drug prevention information after being presented with social cues (i.e., the name of individuals who use marijuana), especially when such cues represented close social relationships (Leander et al., 2009]]).

RSB, including sex with multiple partners, with casual and commercial partners, and unprotected sex, occurs when it is perceived as instrumental to goals such as drug obtainment and use (Kopetz et al., 2015]]), intimacy, and communion (Cooper, 2010]]; Kopetz, Pickover, et al., 2014; Kopetz et al., 2010]]; Woerner et al., 2016]]). Indeed, in several studies, across community samples, college students, and substance users, we found that women who have experienced interpersonal violence are more likely to engage in RSB (Woerner et al., [^2016], [^2019]). This may be the case because interpersonal violence is a humiliating experience that may result in loss of significance (Kruglanski et al., 2022). Victims of violence may develop low expectations of secure relationships and may become vigilant for harm in relationships which could manifest as fear of being rejected by others (anxiety) and/or discomfort with closeness (avoidance). In such cases, RSB may become a convenient means to interpersonal significance and connection without closeness or emotional intimacy. Interestingly, these effects did not extend to other risk behaviors (i.e., substance use), supporting the notion that RSB may represent a means to interpersonal connection rather than a general tendency for risk propensity.

RSB is often associated with drug use and is often attributed to the pharmacological effects of the drugs. However, recent evidence suggests that engagement in RSB occurs when it is perceived as instrumental to individuals’ goals of drug obtainment. In one study increased accessibility of the drug obtainment goal (through cocaine-related primes) resulted in faster approach tendency toward sex exchange targets in a joystick task. Notably, this effect emerged only for participants for whom sex exchange represented an instrumental means to drug obtainment despite their self-reported intentions to avoid such behavior (Kopetz et al., 2015]]).

The notion that risk behavior is enacted as an instrumental means to goals is also supported by evidence suggesting goal attainment following engagement in risk behavior. For example, negative affect was alleviated following gambling behavior, independent of winning or losing (Mishra et al., 2010]]). Alcohol use is instrumental to emotion regulation; it enhances positive emotions and alleviates negative emotions (e.g., Cooper et al., 1995]]). Moreover, the “cheater’s high” effect suggests that engaging in morally risky conduct actually provides affective benefits (Ruedy et al., 2013]]).

Approaching risk behavior as an instrumental means to one’s goals has important implications for understanding (1) why and when people are willing to take risks (as opposed to choosing non-risk means) to accomplish their goals, (2) how risk behavior is perpetuated, and (3) how it can be prevented or changed. In what follows we discuss how the principles underlying the relationship between goals and means can be applied to address these issues.

###### When and Why Does Risk-Taking Become an Instrumental Means to Individuals’ Goals?

###### Obstacles in Goal Pursuit Increase the Likelihood of Risk Behavior

People have a preference for balance and moderation whereby they attain as many important goals as possible (nutrition, safety, meaning, etc.; Kruglanski et al., 2021]]). They tend to avoid risk behaviors because these behaviors satisfy one need while undermining or neglecting other needs. A key question is what prompts people to shift from risk aversion toward risk-seeking. Prospect theory suggests that people are typically risk-averse but seek risk under conditions of loss (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979]]; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981]]). Psychologically, loss represents failure to attain one’s goals. When goal pursuit is blocked or when one perceives lack of progress, one’s motivational balance is upset. Thwarted goals take priority at the expense of other goals. The motivational strength of a goal increases over time until the goal is attained; this allows the organism to mobilize resources to increase its effort toward goal attainment (Brehm, 1966]]; Fishbach & Finkelstein, 2012]]; Higgins, 2006]]), to persist in the face of obstacles, and to resume goal pursuit after disruption (Bargh et al., 2001]]; Lewin, 1926]]; Wicklund & Gollwitzer, 1982]]). Consequently, the person might be more inclined to search for the most instrumental means to satisfy their unfulfilled goals. When one’s motivational space is dominated by a particular need, while the other needs are momentarily less salient or active, extreme means including risk behavior become particularly instrumental (see next section about the mechanisms that may explain this phenomenon; Kruglanski et al., 2021]]). In other words, people might turn to risk because they perceive that they lack alternative means.

Indeed, across multiple domains, cues that signal a failure to attain a goal prompt more risk-taking. Failing at an intellectual ability task increases one’s preference for risk behavior compared to non-risk behavior (i.e., a bet with 50% chance to win $1000 vs. a bet with 100% chance to get $500; Mishra et al., 2014]]). Among intravenous drug users, failing to alleviate craving increases its strength and results in the taking of even more risks, including theft and sharing needles (Connors, 1992]]; Ready et al., 2020]]). Failure (compared to winning) in previous gambling trials leads individuals to be quicker to initiate subsequent gambling trials (Verbruggen et al., 2017]]). Finally, gun owners who failed on an achievement task or who expected job loss were more likely to perceive guns as a means of personal empowerment, shoot an unarmed target in a shooter task, and justify the use of a gun in an ambiguous threat scenario (Leander et al., 2019]], 2020).

###### The Potential Negative Consequences of Risk Behavior Might Paradoxically Increase Its Perceived Instrumentality

Obstacles might prompt people to consider risk behavior as a means to their goals. The interesting question is what makes risk behavior particularly appealing or instrumental compared to alternative means. One possibility is that risk behavior’s negative consequences can enhance its appeal. This possibility is suggested by the principle of counterfinality (Kruglanski et al., 2015]]; see Chapter 1]] of this volume) and captured by the “No pain, no gain” heuristic. Accordingly, a means is perceived as increasingly instrumental to one’s goals to the extent to which it interferes with or undermines alternative goals. In other words, information about the potentially negative consequences of risk behavior or its detriment to some goals (e.g., health and safety) may be misinterpreted as evidence of the behavior’s instrumentality for other goals that are momentarily salient and important (e.g., alleviating negative affect or fitting in) and may therefore increase the likelihood of that behavior (see Chapter 1]] for evidence).

In line with this idea, our research shows that (1) people are more likely to engage in risk behavior and self-harm when (a) relevant goals (e.g., belonging) become accessible and (b) the negative consequences of risk behavior to their health and safety are emphasized; (2) people who are more concerned with finding the “best” means to fulfill their goals (i.e., people high in a regulatory mode characterized by assessment) are more likely to engage in risk behavior to fulfill their goals; and (3) among these people, engagement in risk behavior is explained by an increase in the perception that risk behavior fulfills their goals (Kopetz, Woerner, Starnes, & Devukaj, 2019). Similarly, providing both cognitive and affective information about the risks of drinking and driving (e.g., crash, charge of driving under the influence) increased the willingness to drive after drinking when the goal of reaching one’s destination quickly and conveniently was accessible and driving was perceived as an instrumental means (Johnson & Kopetz, 2017]]; Starnes et al., 2021]]). Importantly, these effects only occur when the information pertains specifically to drinking and driving, a relevant means to participants’ goals in the moment, and not to risk in general.

###### How Is Engagement in Risk-Taking Perpetuated?

The principles underlying the relationship between goals and means offer insights into how risk behavior is maintained or perpetuated. Behaviors associated with successful goal pursuit acquire positive value through _transfer_ of affect (Fishbach et al., 2004]]). Thus, behaviors that may be initially neutral or even aversive (e.g., smoking) become desirable themselves or goals capable of driving behavior in the absence of the original motivation.

For instance, people often describe their first experience with drugs as awkward, uncomfortable, and physically unpleasant (DiFranza et al., 2004]]; Fallon & Rozin, 1983]]; Moore & Weiss, 1995]]). Many individuals with a substance-use disorder report that they are miserable, that their life is in ruins, and that the drug is not even great anymore. Given that the negative consequences of continued drug use far outweigh the pleasurable effects, self-administration behavior should be extinguished. And yet, despite these individuals consciously acknowledging the negative consequences of continued drug use, deploring their situation, and reporting that the drug does not give great pleasure, their drug craving persists; and they continue to seek and use the drugs. According to the principle of emotional transfer, this may happen because drug use (or any other risk behavior) is initiated as a means to goals (e.g., social acceptance). However, the behavior may then become associated with the positive outcomes of goal attainment and, hence, be imbued with a sense of value and even become an end in itself (as in the case of drugs), which may promote future pursuit. Indeed, studies employing measures of implicit attitudes (e.g., traditional and modified versions of the Implicit Associations Test) revealed that across different substance-use categories (e.g., alcohol, cannabis), substance users evaluate their drug of choice more positively than non-substance users. Furthermore, such evaluations predict increased levels of substance use (e.g., Houben & Wiers, 2008]]).

Intentionally harming or killing oneself in an act of martyrdom offers a good example of how the ultimate risk behavior which threatens one’s very existence may become valued and enacted when it is perceived to serve group survival and status, which may ultimately serve the need for personal significance (Kruglanski et al., 2009]]). Preference for violent means and even martyrdom is stronger for those for whom the group is important and who perceive killing and dying as instrumental means to group enhancement. This may be possible because the affect associated with the group transfers to the means even if it means intentionally killing oneself. Indeed, individuals who feel a sense of fusion with a group report greater willingness to fight and die for the sake of the group (Swann et al., 2014]]).

##### Risk Behavior Requires Resolution of Goal Conflict

People often mention health, success, and meaningful relationships as some of their most important goals. In many cases engaging in risk behavior interferes with these goals. Therefore, to engage in risk behavior as a means to one’s goal, the person has to forego alternative goals that are also important such as health and safety. How do they do that?

According to the GST, engagement in risk behavior, even to the detriment of other goals, represents the ordinary pursuit of whatever goal is the most important in the moment. The saliency and immediacy of the goal that the risk behavior serves could reduce the saliency and importance of alternative goals through a process of goal shielding (Shah et al., 2002]]). Thus, although the person may value health, safety, meaningful relationships, financial security, etc., these goals may be momentarily inhibited and may fail to constrain their behavior.

Problematic drug use and addiction are characterized by an exclusive focus on drug obtainment and use to alleviate the negative affect associated with craving or fulfill other goals at the expense of other concerns such as health and safety. Indeed, drug abusers often report that they experience less pleasure and enjoyment from activities that were pleasurable before the addiction. They appear to sacrifice their social, interpersonal, occupational, and recreational activities in order to sustain their drug use (American Psychiatric Association, 2013]]). “I loved heroin more than I loved my kids,” admitted a former heroin-abusing mother (Hammer, 2021]]), illustrating how priorities can be misaligned in addiction.

Overeating is often the result of the inhibition of health and weight control goals. Eating often involves balancing two goals: food enjoyment and weight control. When the eating enjoyment goal and the weight control goal are equally important, eating behavior reflects pursuit of both goals simultaneously by choosing multifinal means (foods) that are both tasty and healthy (Kopetz et al., 2011]]). However, when the goal of eating enjoyment becomes more salient and important (e.g., the smell of food), it may result in diet violation and unhealthy eating through inhibition of the weight control goal (Kopetz et al., 2011]]; Stroebe et al., 2013]]).

Finally, in their quest for significance, terrorists suppress and devalue all other goals, including self-preservation; they are ready to sacrifice everything, including their own lives, to further their ideology (e.g., religious or ethno-nationalist; Kruglanski, Bélanger et al., 2013]]; Webber et al., 2017]]). For instance, in one interview a Tamil Tiger recalls his experience in one of the training camps that would make him a suicide bomber (i.e., a black tiger): “There they taught us to turn love into a passion for killing. All what we received and knew was hatred, murder and destruction” (Hettiarachchi, 2014]], p. 10).

##### Engagement in Risk Behavior as a Means to One’s Goals Requires Mobilization of Resources

Although it is widely accepted that goal pursuit requires resources, most theoretical models assume that resources mobilize for the pursuit of long-term goals such as health and security. When resources are lacking—because people are tired, distracted, emotionally distressed, or under the influence of alcohol and drugs—people overeat, relapse to drug use, engage in RSB, or become aggressive (Baumeister et al., 1998]]; Everitt & Robbins, 2005]]; Heatherton & Wagner, 2011]]; Hofmann et al., 2008]]; Mann & Ward, 2007]]; Vohs & Heatherton, 2000]]). However, in the presence of sufficient processing resources, the individual may be able to assess the relative value of the temptation compared with its alternatives and may refrain from the pursuit of the immediate goal despite the initial impulse.

By contrast, the current analysis suggests that engagement in risk behavior as a means to one’s goals requires resources. A goal to use drugs requires resources to overcome the obstacles associated with procuring and using the drugs (i.e., finding a drug dealer, avoiding the police, overcoming the pain associated with sticking a needle in one’s arm). A goal to engage in self-harm requires a tremendous amount of energy to go against one’s survival instinct and engage in mutilating and even suicidal behavior. Resources mobilize as a function of goal importance regardless of the specific goals; thus, regulatory resources might enhance rather than decrease risk behavior.

Empirical evidence supports this idea. For instance, the _self-control for personal harm_ model (Rawn & Vohs, 2011]]) suggests that people exercise self-control to engage in risk behavior as a means to their social goals; they overcome the initial aversive taste and experience of alcohol and tobacco (DiFranza et al., 2004]]; Fallon & Rozin, 1983]]; Moore & Weiss, 1995]]).

In the prevailing view, adolescent risk behavior is maladaptive and due primarily to a developmental gap between an overdeveloped and hypersensitive motivational-affective system and an underdeveloped executive system (Somerville & Casey, 2010]]; Steinberg, 2007]]). Yet, a closer look suggests more nuance. Although some forms of youth risk behavior might be problematic (e.g., substance use), most adolescent risk behavior appears to serve useful developmental tasks such as peer socialization, exploration, learning, and transition to adulthood (Crone & Dahl, 2012]]). Furthermore, recent studies suggest that many adolescent risk activities are facilitated (rather than reduced) by higher levels of executive function (Berns et al., 2009]]; Romer et al, 2011]]).

In line with these notions, in a recent study we showed that higher levels of sensation-seeking, an important developmental motivation, increased risk-taking in adolescents; furthermore, increased risk-taking was supported (rather than reduced) by higher levels of executive control (Kopetz, Woerner, MacPherson, et al., 2019). Interestingly, factors that reduced sensation-seeking (early psychosocial adversity) also decreased engagement in risk-taking. Risk-taking was further reduced by the deleterious effects of adversity on executive control.

###### Motivated Distortion

One might wonder what resources are necessary for risk-taking. As suggested above, engagement in risk behavior can require inhibition of the goals with which this behavior interferes, a process that is resource-dependent (Bélanger et al., 2013]]; Kruglanski et al., 2012]]). Thus, one possibility is that resources are necessary to inhibit alternative goals. Another possibility is that resources are necessary to ignore or even distort the negative consequences of the behavior, a process known as _motivated distortion_ (Kunda, 1990]]), whereby key information relevant to goal pursuit is distorted to fit with the current motivational state (Bélanger et al., 2014]]). For instance, despite the known negative consequences associated with smoking, a heightened motivation to smoke (i.e., a craving) predisposes smokers to overemphasize the positive outcomes of smoking (Kirchner & Sayette, 2007]]) and to underestimate personal vulnerability to smoking-related disease (Windschitl, 2002]]).

Longitudinal work has also shown that as adolescents engage in risk behavior, they overestimate their peers’ engagement in risk behavior and that, although their perception of vulnerability to the potential negative consequences of the risk behavior increases, their concerns for health and safety goals decreases (Gerrard et al., 1996]]). In line with the notions above, these findings suggest that adolescents may inhibit goals related to health and safety and focus on the instrumentality of risk behavior to their focal goal (e.g., belonging or socializing). Not surprisingly, these distortions in perceptions were associated with subsequent increased engagement in in risk behavior.

#### Implications for Preventing the Negative Consequences of Risk Behavior

Although we make the argument that risk behavior is simply motivated behavior that follows the basic principles of goal pursuit underlying any other motivated behavior, engagement in many risk behaviors comes with serious consequences for oneself and others. Thus, while we recognize the functionality of the behavior and the necessity to take risks for personal and societal advancement, we want to develop strategies to prevent the negative consequences associated with some of these behaviors.

Many strategies designed to prevent risk behaviors or to limit their negative consequences consist of (1) communication campaigns intended to arouse fear or to change people’s knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes or (2) prohibitions (e.g., no smoking in indoor areas, abstinence-based programs to reduce teen pregnancy and sexual transmitted diseases) and law-enforcing strategies (e.g., sobriety checkpoints, raising the legal purchase age for alcohol and tobacco products). Unfortunately, many of these strategies are rarely based on scientific evidence about risk behavior and have limited success (e.g., Reyna & Farley, 2006]]; T. D. Wilson, 2015]]).

Approaching risk behavior based on the principles of goal pursuit may inform more successful strategies to reduce the negative consequences associated with risk-taking. In many instances, risk behaviors are people’s “best” choice, subjectively speaking, to fulfill important goals such as belonging, emotion regulation, intimacy and communion, achievement, or a sense of significance. Accordingly, to reduce risk behavior or limit its negative consequences, we should (1) identify the goals that the behavior serves and reduce its instrumentality (people’s perception that it is their best option to achieve these goals) and (2) enhance the importance of alternative goals (e.g., health and safety) and channel people’s resources toward achieving these goals.

##### Identifying Goals That the Behavior Serves and Reducing Instrumentality

The US government has invested billions of dollars in programs designed to reduce risk behaviors. For instance, sex education programs funded through US federal government’s Title V aim to reduce pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections among teens by emphasizing abstinence. However, most of these programs do not change behavior or knowledge (Trenholm et al., 2008]]). This may be the case because they disregard that teens engage in risky sexual behavior because they feel disengaged and socially excluded from their school and community (Fletcher et al., 2008]]).

Road safety and anti-smoking campaigns use threat appeals such as graphic representations of the death and injury or diseased organs. Despite their popularity, threat appeals are not only ineffective but may even provoke an increase in the risky behavior (e.g., Carey & Sarma, 2016]]; Crano et al., 2001]]; Crano & Burgoon, 2002]]; Cronce & Larimer, 2011]]; Jessop et al., 2008]]). In light of evidence supporting the notion of counterfinality, these findings are not surprising anymore.

Approaching risk behavior as strategic goal pursuit suggests potentially more effective avenues to reduce the likelihood of engaging in it. One way is to decrease perceptions of the behavior’s instrumentality to people’s goals by introducing alternative means to the goals that risk behavior serves. This possibility is suggested by the _substitutability_ principle (Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2015]), which posits that a given behavior’s association strength with a particular goal (and therefore the likelihood to engage in that behavior) decreases when it can be substituted out for some alternative behavior that serves the same end. For instance, although sex education programs that emphasize abstinence are largely ineffective (Trenholm et al., 2008]]), programs that acknowledge that risky sexual behavior often fulfills youth needs for connection and that attempt to provide teens with alternative means to their belonging goals, such as volunteering (e.g., Teen Outreach Program), reduce the likelihood of teen pregnancy by half, while enhancing youth’s sense of autonomy and connection.

Smoking is often associated with negative affect (e.g., Kassel et al., 2003]]; Shiffman & Waters, 2004]]). According to the principle of substitution, introducing alternative behaviors to smoking as a means to address negative affect should detract from smoking. In line with these notions, over four experimental sessions, we trained depressed smokers to avoid (push away using a joystick) smoking-related cues and to consider instead (pull toward or approach using the joystick) alternative rewarding activities in response to negative affect. The results showed that over time the alternative (non-smoking) activity became more accessible (_M_ = 679.59 ms; _SD_ = 28.06 in Session 4 vs. _M_ = 732.65, _SD_ = 22.44 in Session 1). Participants who underwent the training showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms between baseline and follow-up (_M_ = 14.01, _SD_ = 1.29 vs. _M_ = 7.38, _SD_ = 1.10). In addition, more of them remained abstinent during the follow-up (31.4% compared to 16.1% in the control condition), and those who relapsed took longer to relapse to 7 consecutive days of smoking compared to the control condition (_M_ = 10.65 days, _SD_ = 12.60 vs. _M_ = 5.35 days, _SD_ = 10.29; Kopetz et al., 2017]]).

##### Enhance the Importance of Alternative Goals

The notion of goal shielding and the evidence discussed above suggest that enhancing the saliency and importance of alternative goals such as health and safety could reduce the likelihood of risk behavior. When such goals are chronically accessible, they will constrain people’s behavior (through multifinality constraints, goal shielding) and reduce the likelihood to adopt risky behaviors. Indeed, people who prioritize healthy eating on a regular basis automatically think about their health goals and are less likely to choose unhealthy food when they are faced with unhealthy temptations (Fishbach et al., 2003]]). Similarly, reminding hungry participants of their dieting goal reduced the number of foods hungry participants considered for lunch and resulted in a healthier choice of non-fattening, low-caloric foods (Kopetz et al., 2011]]).

Outside the lab these ideas have been implemented successfully by introducing mandatory school food policies that emphasize healthy eating and exercising early on such that these become chronically accessible and important goals. For instance, the French National Nutrition and Health Program launched in 2001 (e.g., Hercberg et al., 2008]]) introduced school regulations that guide the general format of meals and portion sizes but also educate children about food; in addition, vending machines have been banned. The Food Quality Observatory monitors the nutrient quality of the food supply in France. Since the inception of the program, the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children has stagnated or even decreased to a level lower than most neighboring European countries (Lioret et al., 2009]]; Salanave et al., 2009]]).

### How Does GST Advance the Science of Risk Behavior?

The previous section makes the argument and provides evidence that risk behavior could be approached as a means to one’s goals and understood in the context of an individual’s complex systems of goals and means. In this context, the general principles of goal pursuit such as spread of activation, counterfinality, transfer of affect, substitution, intergoal inhibition, and resource mobilization could be applied to understand initiation, maintenance, as well as prevention and change of risk behavior. But what does this mean for the science of risk behavior in general? We believe that this approach has several advantages:

1. A goal systems perspective offers a more parsimonious view of risk behavior. It suggests that risk behavior is simply a case of motivated behavior; therefore, the general principles of goal pursuit should apply to understand all aspects of risk behavior—initiation, maintenance, prevention, and change.

2. This approach is compatible with previous approaches; it provides a framework to integrate them but also to go beyond and address previously unanswered questions with important theoretical and practical implications.

Risk phenomena have been studied separately and often from different perspectives. Some emphasized individual characteristics (e.g., de Wit & Richards, 2004]]; Lejuez et al., 2005]]; Wills et al., 2007]]; Zuckerman, 2007]]). Others have focused on the cold cognitive processes through which the individual establishes the “utility,” or subjective value, of engaging in risk behaviors (e.g., Figner & Weber, 2011]]; Kahneman et al., 1982]]; Reyna, 2004]]) or suggested that risky decisions stem from people’s affective reaction to different outcomes associated with risk-taking and that these reactions are often discrepant from judgments of utility (Loewenstein et al., 2001]]; Slovic et al., 2002]]). These approaches typically do not specify the source of judgments and emotional reactions. By contrast, several motivational approaches suggest that both subjective value or utility and the emotional reactions that people have in risk situations depend on their goals as well as the preferences for different strategies for goal pursuit. From this perspective, risk behavior represents a strategic response to individuals’ current motivational state (e.g., Lopes, 1987]]; Mishra, 2014]]; Zou et al., 2020]]). But even if they recognize that risk behavior is goal-driven, most motivational approaches focus on specific goals (i.e., achievement, aspiration, prevention) and strategic preferences (i.e., eagerness for prevention vs. vigilance for promotion); they do not specify the general processes through which risk behavior can be perceived as instrumental to one’s goals and then initiated and maintained to fulfill these goals despite potential negative consequences.

Similar to previous approaches, the GST approach suggests that people engage in risk behavior as a function of the behavior’s subjective value or utility. However, the subjective value is not derived from the person’s judgments of wins and losses vis-à-vis the status quo. Rather, it is a goal-dependent evaluation of whether the behavior is instrumental to a current or chronic goal. Furthermore, evaluations of instrumentality are the result of the general structural (different goals–means configurations) and motivational (i.e., goal importance or strength, transfer of affect) properties of goals.

In line with the individual differences accounts, the GST perspective acknowledges that certain people are more susceptible to engaging in risk behavior; however, it suggests that this susceptibility is the result of their sensitivity to the instrumentality of risk behavior to their goals, rather than of their inability to choose “more appropriate” responses to the situations in which they find themselves.

Most importantly, unlike previous approaches, the GST perspective acknowledges that risk behavior does not happen in a motivational vacuum and emphasizes the importance of considering risk behavior in the broader context of people’s multiple goals and the means to achieve them. In doing so, it provides insights into questions that have not been addressed previously: the conditions and the mechanisms through which risk behaviors become instrumental means to people’s goals and how and why risk behavior is initiated and maintained despite the potential negative consequences.

3. A GST approach is content-free and therefore more generalizable. It suggests that the general principles underlying engagement in any other behavior also apply to understanding when and why people engage in risk regardless of whether it is substance use, RSB, drinking and driving, or any other risk behavior.

### Summary and Conclusions

As this volume attests, there are numerous reasons to celebrate GST. The present chapter discusses the utility of the theory for the science of risk behavior. Risk behavior is both vilified and glorified (depending on the behavior and the outcomes). On the one hand, nearly half of the preventable deaths in the United States every year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014]]) are attributed to risk behavior such as substance use, drunk driving, or overeating. On the other hand, willingness to take risk allowed the human species to expand territory, replace the horse by the automobile, and fly to the moon. Taking risks is what affords growth, progress, and heroism. Risk-takers are courageous, willing to lose in order to achieve, and worthy of admiration and respect.

This chapter makes the argument that risk is neither good nor bad. It is simply one of the many strategies people have to pursue their goals. Whether we are heroes and risk our lives to save others’ or do not let a day go by without a few too many glasses depends on the function that the behavior serves for us in the moment. Although these behaviors are seemingly different and are often attributed to different individual characteristics or processes, they all represent goal pursuit: People engage in them because they are perceived as their best, or only, strategy to achieve important goals. People do understand the harm that may result from these behaviors. However, in the absence of alternative (better) ways to fulfill their goals, they mobilize their resources to inhibit concerns for health and safety; they process both factual and affective information in a way that supports their goal pursuit and distorts the information that is inconsistent with it.

A GST approach (1) allows us to understand when and why risk behavior becomes the best strategy to people’s goals and (2) why we keep taking certain risks despite potentially negative consequences; (3) it allows us to move away from stigmatizing the behavior (e.g., as due to “lack of willpower”) and (4) to develop more efficient strategies to prevent and change it.

We believe that the GST provides a more balanced and parsimonious view of risk behavior in terms of the principles that account for human behavior in general; it accounts for existent findings, but it also allows us to move forward and answer previously unanswered questions.

The Means–Ends Fusion Model of Intrinsic Motivation](04_Contents1.xhtml#n0004)

Kaitlin Woolley and Ayelet Fishbach

When a reporter in Philadelphia asked George Mallory in 1923 why he wanted to climb Mount Everest, the early mountain explorer answered, “Because it is there.” This answer may seem surprising and unsatisfactory, especially given prior understanding of what motivates behavior. You may have expected Mallory to point to specific reasons for climbing, such as a desire for mastery, to be in control, or possibly to achieve money or fame. Yet Mallory gives none of these reasons.

Our recent research can help explain what Mallory meant. For him, climbing Mount Everest was rewarding in and of itself—he did not have an ulterior goal. Rather, he was intrinsically motivated to climb. Those who are intrinsically motivated cannot separate pursuing the activity from receiving its benefits. They engage in the activity simply to do it—pursuing the activity is their goal. In the person’s mind, there is a perceptual fusion between the activity and its purpose; these two are one.

This view of intrinsic motivation is based on a structural perspective, which defines intrinsic motivation as experiencing an activity as its own end. This new perspective is informed by over 20 years of research on goal systems theory (see Chapter 1]] in this volume; Kruglanski et al., 2002]]). This perspective argues that intrinsic motivation arises from the cognitive associations between means and their end goals (Fishbach & Woolley, 2022]]; Kruglanski et al., 2018]]). That is, people are intrinsically motivated when the means and end are mentally fused. Thinking about one necessarily brings the other to mind. For a mountain climber with a goal to summit Everest, thoughts about climbing (means) bring about thoughts related to conquering Everest (end) and vice versa.

The present chapter details this structural perspective of intrinsic motivation and the corresponding means–ends fusion (MEF) model (Figure 3.1]]). We explain how the MEF model, which identifies intrinsic motivation as the perceptual fusion between an activity and a goal, advances understanding of what it means to be intrinsically motivated. Throughout, we focus on four key antecedents of fusion and the consequence of this fusion for persistence in goals. By understanding the meaning and causes of intrinsic motivation, we not only enrich theory on how to increase motivation in goal pursuit but further propose interventions that can help people facilitate achievement of important life goals.

### What Does It Mean to Be Intrinsically Motivated?

Intrinsic motivation has received wide attention in the literature, and for good reason. People who are intrinsically motivated experience benefits in the workplace, academics, health, and beyond (Grant & Berry, 2011]]; Ng et al., 2012]]; Van den Broeck et al., 2021]]; van Egmond et al., 2017]]). When people are interested in and enjoy activities that facilitate important life goals, they are more likely to achieve these goals (Li et al., 2021]]). For example, intrinsic motivation predicted greater school attendance among female students in rural Malawi (van Egmond et al., 2017]]) and successful pursuit of New Year’s resolutions among adults in the United States (Woolley & Fishbach, 2017]]). The reason? It is easier to pursue activities that are strongly associated with the benefits they achieve.

The rich literature on intrinsic motivation offers several perspectives. This chapter focuses on the structural perspective, that is, the MEF model, which identifies unique antecedents not previously examined as drivers of intrinsic motivation. Predicated on goal systems theory (Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2015], [^2018]; see also Chapter 1]] in this volume), the MEF model explores the structural relationship between end goals and their means of achievement. Such means–end relationships are knowledge structures organized around associative networks, whereby higher-order goals are connected to lower-level means of attainment. According to the MEF model, goals that are closely connected to their means result in greater intrinsic motivation than goals that are clearly separated from their means. In the following section, we detail how this model arose as well as why we believe it is a more comprehensive predictor of behavior than other conceptualizations of intrinsic motivation.

### The MEF Model of Intrinsic Motivation

The primary tenet of the MEF model is that intrinsic motivation results from a perceptual fusion between a means and its end (Kruglanski et al., 2018]]; Woolley & Fishbach, 2018]]). That is, to be intrinsically motivated means that the action one engages in and the outcome one achieves are strongly connected, such that they form a unified Gestalt and cannot be separated (Heider, 1958]]).

According to this perspective, intrinsic motivation lies on a continuum based on the strength of the means–ends association. To understand this concept, it helps to understand the underlying theory regarding goal systems (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]). Within a goal system, goals exist in a hierarchy and are cognitively linked with corresponding means of attainment. A means may achieve, and thus be linked to, a subgoal, which in turn achieves and is linked to an overarching goal. Means that are strongly associated with a goal, such that they are perceptually fused, are experienced as more intrinsically motivated. Means that are more distally connected to a goal are less intrinsically motivated. For example, someone who sees running (means) as the primary way of achieving fitness (ends) will be more intrinsically motivated to run in pursuit of fitness than someone who sees running as one of many means of achieving fitness, in which case running is less strongly associated with the fitness goal. That is, a _unifinal_ structure, in which there is a single, and thus strong, association between means and ends, results in greater intrinsic motivation than an _equifinal_ structure, in which multiple means serve a single end (see also Chapter 1]] in this volume for goal systems structures).

#### Empirical Support for the MEF Model

One of the earliest studies supporting the MEF model explored affect transfer in goal systems (Fishbach et al., 2004]]). This study found that the close association between a goal and an activity can cause positive affect from a goal to transfer over to the activity by which the goal is achieved. Different goals result in different emotional outcomes (e.g., relief, pleasure, or pride). Accordingly, this research further found that the stronger the means–end association is, the more the emotions that characterize goal attainment—be that relief, pleasure, or pride—come to characterize the activity as well. Importantly, this research found that for affect transfer to occur, the means and ends needed to be closely associated.

More recent empirical support for the MEF model comes from research that formalizes and tests a mathematical model for the association between means and ends (see Chapter 14 in this volume; Melnikoff et al., 2022]]). One study manipulated the strength of the association between mouse clicks on a tile (means) and receiving a bonus (end). In line with the MEF model, when there was a stronger association between the means and end, such that clicking was more likely to result in receiving a bonus, people were more intrinsically motivated. They found the tile clicking game to be more immersive, engaging, and engrossing.

Other conceptualizations of intrinsic motivation agree with the MEF model (Amabile, 1993]]; Heath, 1999]]). Research on academic performance distinguished between two factors: work orientation, a personality variable characterizing a focus on long-term rewards from fulfilling career expectations (hence, weak means–end association), and intrinsic motivation, an experiential variable emphasizing the short-term rewards of enjoying the ongoing experience (hence, strong means–end association). This research found that intrinsic motivation predicted high-school students’ academic achievement (Wong & Csikszentmihalyi, 1991]]). Specifically, whereas students’ intrinsic motivation to study predicted the level of difficulty they chose for their high school courses, there was no corresponding effect of work orientation.

#### Structural versus Content Models of Intrinsic Motivation

The structural perspective proposed by the MEF model is not the only model of intrinsic motivation. In particular, this model diverges from the content-based perspective, which explores the content of goals that are intrinsically motivating (Howard et al., 2017]]; Ryan & Deci, 2000]]). The content-based perspective assumes that certain goals are more likely experienced as their own end, and thus more likely to be intrinsic. For example, this perspective argued that medical students who enter the profession to help those in need and business students who desire to improve workers’ lives and the economy are both intrinsically motivated. In contrast, medical and business students who are driven by status, social recognition, or approval from others are extrinsically motivated (Greco & Kraimer, 2020]]).

Consistent with the content-based approach, when people pursue basic and innate (i.e., “internal”) motives such as competence, relatedness, and autonomy, they tend to be intrinsically motivated. People pursuing these goals often experience them as their own end. In contrast, when people pursue status and money (i.e., “internalized” motives), they tend to be extrinsically motivated, so they do not experience the pursuit as its own end (Ryan & Deci 2000]]).

Understanding what motives are innate and more likely to be intrinsically motivating, as well as how external motives come to be internalized, is an important aspect of motivation theory. However, this distinction has at times led to the conclusion that certain internal motives are always intrinsic, whereas internalized motives are always extrinsic. This is not necessarily the case. If an activity is strongly associated with an internalized motive, for example, it will be experienced as its own end and be intrinsically motivated.

To illustrate the distinction between the structural and content-based perspectives, consider the following activities: climbing a mountain and having dinner. Whereas these activities are typically associated with intrinsic contents—satisfying exploration and affiliation goal contents, respectively—there are examples when this does not hold. Climbing a mountain may also achieve celebrity and social recognition, which are considered external contents. Further, dinner may be a means to achieving a job during a recruitment event. Even something like sex, often considered an internal motive, could be associated with external motives for a couple trying to conceive.

Utilizing a structural perspective of intrinsic motivation allows us to move beyond content-based approaches. We can identify situations that may seem intrinsic based on their contents, but that are actually not intrinsically motivated when considering the relationship between the means and ends. Furthermore, utilizing the MEF model allows us to harness contents typically seen as extrinsically motivated and fuse them more tightly with means of goal achievement, such that they instead becoming intrinsically motivating. That is, by associating extrinsic outcomes with their means, we can increase intrinsic motivation.

As an illustration, consider monetary rewards. Financial incentives are typically seen as extrinsic in that payment often arrives after engaging with an activity, and thus is cognitively separate from it. However, financial incentives are not always extrinsic and, in fact, can result in intrinsic motivation to engage in a paid activity when the incentives are closely associated with that activity (e.g., for the gambler who experiences gambling as its own end).

Notably, despite the different perspectives, researchers tend to agree on how to assess intrinsic motivation. This is because these perspectives align in their definition of intrinsic motivation as pursuing an activity as its own end (Csikszentmihalyi, 2014]]; Deci, 1975]]; Deci & Ryan, 1985]]; Kruglanski, 1975]]; Kruglanski et al., 2018]]; Vallerand, 2007]]).

#### Assessing Intrinsic Motivation

There are two primary assessments of intrinsic motivation, one which relies on self-reported experience (e.g., interest and enjoyment) during pursuit of an activity and one that uses a behavioral indicator (engagement during a free-choice period).

To the first measure, actions that are intrinsically motivated are more interesting and enjoyable. As noted previously, from a goals system perspective, the close association between an activity and its end leads to affect transfer—the positive properties of goal attainment transfer to the means of goal pursuit (Fishbach et al., 2004]]). Positive affect invested in the goal is transferred to the means assumed to serve that goal in proportion to the strength of the connection between the goals and means. Thus, if people report greater interest, curiosity, enjoyment, and other positive feelings, they are assumed to be intrinsically motivated (Amabile et al., 1994]]; Grant, 2008]]; Vallerand et al., 1992]]; Woolley & Sharif, 2021]]).

To the second measure, the free-choice paradigm, intrinsic motivation is assessed based on whether people choose to continue the activity during overtime. If people engage in an activity during “free choice” when they have the option to leave, we assume that they are intrinsically motivated (Lepper et al., 1973]]; Reeve & Deci, 1996]]; Woolley & Fishbach, 2018]]). So, for example, someone who continues to read an excerpt from a book even after they are no longer required to do so by the experimenter, the teacher, or the parent is said to be intrinsically motivated to read.

Of course, people may at times initiate activities during free choice for reasons unrelated to intrinsic motivation, such as a desire to show off (Ryan et al., 1991]]) or because the task was interrupted (i.e., the Zeigarnik effect; Reeve et al., 1986]]). For this reason, using these two methods of assessing intrinsic motivation concurrently and measuring their correlation is beneficial to make certain that intrinsic motivation is captured (Reeve & Deci, 1996]]). Indeed, it is frequently the case that these measures are correlated as people often choose to pursue activities during free choice that they anticipate enjoying more (Woolley & Sharif, 2022]]).

### Four Antecedents of Intrinsic Motivation

Although the structural and content-based perspectives on intrinsic motivation rely on similar measures to assess intrinsic motivation, these perspectives identify different factors that bring about intrinsic motivation. The MEF model offers a set of antecedents of intrinsic motivation that are summarized in Table 3.1]]. What connects these four different antecedents is that they strengthen the means–end association.

Table 3.1 Antecedents of Intrinsic Motivation

|Phenomenon|Definition|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|Unique means–end association|A means achieves fewer end goals, and those goals are only achieved by this means.|People were more intrinsically motivated to “hang out with others” to pursue a relatedness goal when hanging out with others was described as a single means to achieve relatedness than when it was one of many means (Bélanger et al., 2015]]).|
|Repeated pairing of the means with its end|A means frequently achieves an end goal.|Repeatedly pairing unknown beer brands with positive stimuli (i.e., _resources/books//Goal Systems Theory_ Psychological Process - Arie W. Kruglanski of people having fun) increased brand evaluations compared with pairing the beer brands with neutral stimuli (Sweldens et al., 2010]]).|
|Similarity of means–end pairing|The end goal and the means are similar.|Participants playing a computer game with a performance goal were more intrinsically interested in the game when it was described as a “game of skill” (which better matched the performance goal) than when it was described as a “fantasy game” (Sansone et al., 1989]]).|
|Immediacy of ends in relation to means|A means achieves an end goal earlier.|Participants reading a book excerpt who expected payment for reading to arrive that day (vs. that month) enjoyed reading more and chose to continue reading the excerpt when given free time (Woolley & Fishbach, 2018]]).|

#### Unique Means–End Association

Having a unique association between a means and its end goal strengthens the activity goal connection, and therefore intrinsic motivation. The fewer the number of links between a means and its end, the stronger the bond between them. This notion reflects Anderson’s (1983)]] _fan principle_, whereby the greater the number of links between a cue and a concept, the lower the ability of the cue to activate the concept.

Consider the example of someone who sees running as one of several means of achieving fitness. This is an equifinal configuration, in which running is less strongly associated with the fitness goal (Figure 3.2A]]) compared with if running were the only means to achieve fitness. The MEF model proposes that in equifinal configurations, the association between a single means and its corresponding goal may be weakened through the addition of alternative associations between the goal and other means that can achieve the goal. This in turn could reduce intrinsic motivation.

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-007-colour.gif)

Figure 3.2 Having an equifinal configuration (A) or a multifinal configuration (B) results in lower intrinsic motivation than having a unifinal means–end configuration (C).

In one study demonstrating how multiple means undermine intrinsic motivation, adding more means to a goal diluted the means–end association, which in turn reduced intrinsic motivation to engage in the means (Bélanger et al., 2015]]). Specifically, participants pursuing a goal of connecting with others (i.e., relatedness) viewed either one means to achieve this goal—hanging out with other people (unifinal)—or two means—(1) hanging out with other people and (2) helping other people (equifinal). Participants believed that hanging out with other people was less effective for achieving their relatedness goal when hanging out with others was one of two means to achieve relatedness than when it was the only means to achieve relatedness. Furthermore, people reported less intrinsic motivation to hang out with other people when it was one of two means (vs. the only means) of achieving relatedness.

To further highlight the role of uniqueness of means in affecting intrinsic motivation, consider a multifinal configuration. For example, someone may run to improve their fitness, exercise their dog, and connect with other runners. In this case, a single means serves multiple goals (Figure 3.2B]]). Research on the dilution effect found that having a single means achieve multiple goals undermines the association between the means and the goal (Zhang et al., 2007]]). A classic demonstration of this comes from research on the overjustification effect (Lepper et al., 1973]]). Children who love coloring without a reward had lower intrinsic motivation to color when a reward was added and then removed. Presumably, children draw for self-expression, and adding a reward diluted the association between drawing and the original goal of self-expression, such that children were less intrinsically motivated to draw.

Research on healthy eating makes a similar point. In one study, 3- to 5-year-old children who learned that carrots or crackers delivered benefits beyond good taste (i.e., served an additional goal, such as helping them to read or count) ate fewer carrots and crackers (Maimaran & Fishbach, 2014]]). The additional goal reduced the association between the means (eating carrots/crackers) and the initial goal (positive taste), undermining children’s desire to eat these foods. Interestingly, in this research, unlike in the overjustification findings, the additional goal (health benefits) was never removed. Nonetheless, because children mainly eat food because it is tasty, they were less interested in food presented as healthy. Adults show a similar effect. In a study conducted at campus dining halls (Turnwald et al., 2019]]), people ate more of a healthy food when the taste was emphasized (the primary motivation for eating food) than when the health was emphasized (an additional goal that eating food achieves). Presenting vegetables with taste-focused labels, such as “twisted citrus glazed beets” increased vegetable consumption relative to using health-focused labels, such as “heart healthy beets with oranges.”

Other research explores how a unique means–end relationship fosters intrinsic motivation. For example, a study on review writing (Woolley & Sharif, 2021]]) had participants write a review (means) either for a bonus payment (strong means–end association) or as part of a study that also offered a bonus unrelated to the review (weak means–end association). When a bonus was more strongly associated with reviewing, participants were more intrinsically motivated—they reported that review writing was more interesting and enjoyable, and they were more interested in writing a review in the future.

These findings highlight how a unique means-end association facilitates intrinsic motivation. Across these examples, the fewer links between means and ends, whether by having fewer means to achieve a single goal or fewer goals achieved by a single means, the greater the resulting intrinsic motivation.

#### Repeated Pairing of a Means with Its End

A second avenue for increasing the association between means and ends is through their repeated pairing. When an activity and outcome are frequently encountered together, they become cognitively linked.

Initial evidence for how this affects motivation comes from research on conditioning animal behavior. In a classic demonstration, chimpanzees learned to complete tasks to receive tokens and to insert tokens to receive grapes (Hilgard & Bower, 1966). Whereas “earning” tokens was a neutral activity for chimpanzees, receiving grapes was a positive reward. In time, the repeated pairing of grapes for tokens led the activity of obtaining tokens to take on a positive value—activities performed to earn tokens became fused with the goal of food obtainment. The excitement of receiving the reward transferred to the behavior that led to it. Pulling the lever to receive tokens became enjoyable in itself.

With humans, a similar effect arises. Repeated pairing of an activity with its outcome causes positive associations from the outcome to transfer to the activity. Research on evaluative conditioning highlights this effect. Associating a neutral activity with a reward through repeated pairing facilitates liking of the neutral activity, even after the reward is removed (De Houwer et al., 2001]]). Extending this finding to brand and product evaluations, researchers found that pairing a pen with liked (vs. disliked) music increased preference for the pen (Gorn, 1982]]) and repeatedly pairing unknown beer brands with positive stimuli (i.e., _resources/books//Goal Systems Theory_ Psychological Process - Arie W. Kruglanski of people having fun) versus neutral _resources/books//Goal Systems Theory_ Psychological Process - Arie W. Kruglanski increased evaluations of the beer brands (Sweldens et al., 2010]]).

Overall, repeated pairing of an activity and a goal increases intrinsic motivation. The repeated experience of the activity and its outcome leads to greater perceptual fusion between the two.

#### Similarity of Means–End Pairing

Greater similarity or fit between an activity and its goal also increases intrinsic motivation. Activities and goals that appear more similar or that otherwise fit together are mentally connected (Higgins, 2005]]). This in turn increases intrinsic motivation. For example, receiving payment in a coin-toss game, in which coins prominently featured in the game and fit with the outcome of winning money, increased intrinsic motivation to play (Kruglanski et al., 1975]]); playing the game was closely associated in players’ minds with earning money. Although in other contexts it may be unintuitive to consider intrinsic motivation as resulting from payment, the similarity between the activity (coin-toss) and the outcome (winning coins) enabled the connection. Thus, in the absence of monetary reward, players were no longer interested in the coin-toss game.

In another study, participants playing a computer game with a performance goal were more intrinsically motivated when the game was described as a “game of skill” (which better matched the performance goal) than when it was described as a “fantasy game” (Sansone et al., 1989]]). The better match, or perceived similarity, between the goal of the game and the means of achieving the goal facilitated intrinsic motivation.

A desire for fit can also affect reward choice. In one study, people were asked to review either 30 songs or 30 movies and then choose a reward to receive (three music CDs vs. three movie DVDs). A greater percentage of people chose to receive CDs as their reward when their activity involved evaluating songs (56%) versus movies (19%), suggesting that people desire a fit between activities and rewards (Kivetz, 2005]]). Rewards that are congruent or “fit with” the activity reinforce intrinsic motivation.

Other times, the activity fits the goal only in a particular time and place. Most people are intrinsically motivated to work during workdays and not during holidays or weekends. Students studying during a federal holiday, which was not a university holiday, thus experienced greater intrinsic motivation to work when they perceived this time as “standard work time” than when they perceived this time as “non-standard” (i.e., as a holiday; Giurge & Woolley, 2022]]). The perception that one is working during non-standard work time undermines intrinsic motivation due to the lack of fit.

Other studies further find that doing things at the “right” time feels intrinsic. People prefer to eat breakfast food at breakfast time and dinner food at dinner time (Markman et al., 2007]]). Relatedly, people prefer to receive good news at “the right time.” Learning that a goal has been attained results in more positive emotion than learning that a goal will be attained (Klein & Fishbach, 2014]]). As such, participants were happier when they received an official decision letter offering them a job compared with first receiving an early, unofficial decision letter offering them a job followed by an official decision letter. Early positive news disrupted people’s script for their goal, such that it may be more intrinsically motivating to learn positive news about the goal at the time of goal attainment.

Similarly, research on regulatory fit identified that rewarding approach goals with rewards and avoidance goals with removal of rewards increases the perception of fit and, hence, increases motivation (Higgins, 2005]]). So, for example, watching a highbrow movie fits a learning goal more than a relaxation goal. Therefore, people could be more intrinsically motivated to watch a highbrow movie when their goal is to learn. To facilitate intrinsic motivation, it helps to ensure a close fit between means and their end goals.

#### Immediacy of Ends in Relation to Means

Activities that result in earlier goal achievement are more strongly associated with the goal. For this reason, an earlier arrival of a goal increases intrinsic motivation.

Consider a study in which students completed a survey in return for a chocolate reward (Woolley & Fishbach, 2018]]). Half of the students received the chocolate while they were working on the survey (but were not allowed to eat the chocolate until after they finished the survey), whereas the rest only received the chocolate after completing the survey. We found that when the chocolate prize was delivered while participants worked on the task, they were more intrinsically motivated—they indicated the survey was more interesting and fun. An earlier arrival of the chocolate reward led participants to associate it with working on the survey, which increased intrinsic motivation. Note, however, that it is possible for a reward to be too early (i.e., before the activity), which might disrupt the means–end association rather than strengthen it. People likely do not want to celebrate goal achievement before they have officially completed the work (Klein & Fishbach, 2014]]); thus, to increase intrinsic motivation, the reward should arrive earlier in time but should not be consumed before the work has started.

In another study, participants read a book excerpt with the goal of receiving a monetary bonus (Woolley & Fishbach, 2018]]). The bonus for reading either arrived earlier (that day) or later (that month). Participants who expected an earlier (vs. later) bonus reported greater interest in and enjoyment of reading the book excerpt. They were also more likely to choose to continue reading during a free-choice period, when they could either continue reading the book or do another task (with no effect of their choice on their bonus payment).

In the same study, we also tested whether the effect of reward timing on intrinsic motivation was due to a greater perceptual fusion between the means (reading) and ends (reward). We asked participants to rate how much they associated “reading” with “rewards” on a set of Venn diagrams, with more overlapping circles representing a stronger association. We found a stronger association in the immediate (vs. delayed) reward condition, which in turn mediated the effect of reward timing on intrinsic motivation to read the book excerpt.

At first glance, the finding that rewards can increase intrinsic motivation may appear to contradict the earlier finding on the dilution effect (Zhang et al., 2007]]). Recall that the dilution effect showed that adding new goals can decrease the association between a means and any one goal. Importantly, however, when there is no addition of a goal, manipulating the timing of when the goal arrives can affect intrinsic motivation. Rewards can increase intrinsic motivation when they are delivered earlier (vs. later) and are the sole purpose of pursuing the activity.

Providing an earlier (vs. later) reward can also facilitate healthy eating. As previously noted, people eat primarily for enjoyment. Pairing healthy (but less tasty) food with tastier (but less healthy) food together may be more effective than serving the tastier food later (e.g., as a dessert). For example, giving children healthy vegetables with less healthy peanut butter or cream cheese dips could encourage vegetable consumption and enjoyment of vegetables more than when offering children a tasty dessert for eating their veggies. Indeed, if children learn that eating vegetables gets them dessert, they may see eating vegetables as a means to dessert and not an end in itself.

In general, outcomes that are typically seen as extrinsic (i.e., monetary rewards) can be used to facilitate intrinsic motivation when they are more immediately tied to the means. Thus, paying workers sooner facilitates greater intrinsic motivation to work and emphasizing the immediate benefits of vegetables (i.e., positive taste) increases intrinsic motivation to eat healthily.

### Increasing Intrinsic Motivation and Persistence

Understanding the antecedents of MEF gives us some insight into how to increase intrinsic motivation. In what follows, we detail three tested interventions to increase persistence in long-term goals: factoring intrinsic motivation into choice, adding immediate benefits to goal pursuit, and shifting focus to immediate benefits (Table 3.2]]).

Table 3.2 Interventions to Increase Intrinsic Motivation and Persistence in Long-Term Goals

|Phenomenon|Definition|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|Factoring intrinsic motivation into choice|When people incorporate intrinsic motivation into choice, they persist longer.|Gym-goers who selected a workout from a limited set of options that were equally difficult completed more of the workout when choosing one they would “enjoy doing” rather than one that was “useful for their health goals” (Woolley & Fishbach, 2016]]).|
|Adding immediate benefits|When people add immediate benefits to the activity, intrinsic motivation increases.|Pairing rewards with means, such as listening to fun audiobooks at the gym, increases gym attendance.|
|Shifting focus to immediate benefits|When people attend to immediate benefits (including the immediate, positive experience inherent in much of goal pursuit) intrinsic motivation increases.|People who focused on the positive taste of carrots consumed more carrots than those who focused on delayed benefits (health) or no benefits (color; Woolley & Fishbach, 2016]]).|

#### Factoring Intrinsic Motivation into Choice

The first strategy involves factoring in immediate gratification when choosing an activity that serves long-term benefits. People who choose workouts that they like enjoy exercising more (Segar, 2015]]). In a demonstration of this effect, we found that gym-goers who selected a workout from a limited set of options that were equally difficult completed more of the exercise when choosing one they would “enjoy doing” rather than one that was “useful for their health goals” (Woolley & Fishbach, 2016]]). Although people reported primarily exercising for long-term health benefits, it is the immediate experience that determines persistence.

Whenever possible, people should choose activities that enable them to experience intrinsic motivation. Although it appears straightforward, in practice it is not always intuitive. People often choose meals, jobs, or workout routines mainly based on long-term benefits, yet whether they persist depends on their intrinsic motivation—they persist when pursuing the goal is immediately rewarding and feels like an end in itself.

#### Adding Immediate Benefits

To increase intrinsic motivation, people can add immediate benefits that are associated with the activity. As noted above, an earlier arrival of a reward is a surefire way to increase intrinsic motivation. Thus, pairing rewards with activities, such as by listening to fun audiobooks at the gym (Milkman et al., 2014]]) or meeting a friend at the gym (Gershon et al., 2020]]) increases gym attendance.

Other research suggests that it is the immediacy that matters for intrinsic motivation, not necessarily the positivity of the benefits. For example, in a study on tangential immersion, the authors found that adding an attention-grabbing video can increase toothbrushing (Lieberman et al., 2022]]). The additional activity needed to be immersive, but not necessarily positive, to affect persistence. Thus, in one study, students persisted longer in an exercise when the exercise was bundled with a less enjoyable but more immersive task (reading a story as it scrolled across the screen) than when the exercise was bundled with a more enjoyable but less immersive task (viewing a pleasant image accompanied by piano music; Lieberman et al., 2022]]). An immersive task can increase persistence by preventing boredom—and does not need to be pleasant to do so.

Pushing this one step further, our recent research highlights that immediacy can be motivating even when the immediate experience is negative (Woolley & Fishbach, 2022]]). That is, immediate feedback on goal progress can increase intrinsic motivation, in particular for activities that are uncomfortable to pursue. For example, feeling awkward and uncomfortable when taking an improvisation class can increase engagement in the class to the extent that people seek out this uncomfortable experience as their goal. When we instructed improv students to think of feeling awkward and uncomfortable during their class exercise as a sign that the exercise was working, they persisted longer than when we instructed students to feel their skills develop or when we did not offer students explicit instructions (Experiment 1; Woolley & Fishbach, 2022]]). The reason? Feeling uncomfortable is an immediate negative experience that people can harness as a cue of goal progress—thus, they feel they advance their goal of taking improv whenever they feel uncomfortable during the exercise.

This lesson extends beyond students taking improvisation classes and can increase persistence for many self-growth goals that are uncomfortable to pursue. For example, writing about difficult experiences is hard but facilitates mental coping. We found that people were more motivated to write when we instructed them to seek discomfort as a signal of progress relative to when we provided typical instructions for expressive writing exercises (Experiment 2; Woolley & Fishbach, 2022]]). Furthermore, when we instructed people to seek discomfort (vs. to learn), they were more willing to open themselves to useful but threatening information, such as learning about opposing political viewpoints, negative health information, or issues related to gun violence. Seeking discomfort was motivating even when participants were not explicitly instructed to reappraise discomfort as a signal of progress, suggesting that instructions to seek discomfort can lead to spontaneous reappraisal of discomfort as a signal of growth (Experiment 5; Woolley & Fishbach, 2022]]). When people see discomfort as a sign of progress, they can harness this experience to facilitate persistence in important goals.

#### Shifting Focus to Immediate Benefits

Although we find that people can harness an immediate, negative experience to increase goal pursuit (i.e., feeling of discomfort), many goals people pursue come with immediate benefits, yet these benefits may not readily come to mind. A third strategy for increasing intrinsic motivation is therefore to attend to these benefits. By shifting the focus to the immediate, positive experience inherent in much of goal pursuit, people can increase intrinsic motivation.

Take healthy eating. People frequently go on diets or try and increase their vegetable intake for the health benefits that losing weight or consuming more vitamins and minerals provides (i.e., delayed benefits). Yet a simple shift in focus, to consider the positive taste of healthy food, can better motivate people to increase healthy food consumption. In one study, we instructed students to either choose carrots that they liked (immediate benefit focus), choose carrots that they thought were healthy (delayed benefit focus), or choose carrots that were “more orange” (control condition). Students who were encouraged to focus on the positive taste of carrots consumed more carrots than those in the delayed benefit or control conditions (Woolley & Fishbach, 2016]]).

Importantly, focusing on immediate benefits is only effective at motivating goal pursuit to the extent that there are immediate benefits in the first place. Indeed, we found that adopting a taste focus when eating healthy food increased healthy food consumption to the extent that the food was in fact tasty. Focusing people on the good taste (vs. health benefits) of apples, a tasty food, increased consumption; but the same did not occur for raw and plain spinach, a less tasty food (Woolley & Fishbach, 2016]]; see also; Laran & Janiszewski, 2011]]).

Mindfulness research has documented a similar strategy. Instructing people to focus on their immediate, subjective experience when engaging in various actions can prompt healthier habits (Ludwig et al., 2020]]). Someone who eats an apple can bring their awareness to the results of their behavior and potentially how energized they feel from eating this healthy food. Alternatively, someone who eats a bag of potato chips when stressed can bring awareness to the results of their behavior: While eating chips may have resulted in a short-term distraction from stress, what people are left with is potentially stomach bloating (i.e., negative body sensation) and guilt (i.e., unpleasant emotions). In this way, people practicing mindfulness and awareness of their immediate subjective experience may come to realize that they feel good when eating healthy food and feel worse when eating unhealthy food. Mindfulness research suggests that behavior can be shifted in a less effortful and more pleasant way by attending to the immediate outcomes of one’s actions.

Overall, immediacy is an effective motivator. Immediate benefits motivate action by making the experience more positive; thus, people can focus on the immediate benefits inherent in long-term goals (i.e., treat healthy food consumption as an indulgence and think about the positive taste, rather than the health benefits). Yet not all actions come with immediate benefits, and some may instead come with immediate negative outcomes (e.g., feeling awkward when practicing public speaking skills). In this case, people can reframe the discomfort they feel as progress on the goal; doing so is motivating because people come to experience goal achievement when they feel uncomfortable.

### Remaining Questions

The MEF model outlined in this chapter offers many exciting areas for future research. We detail two here. First, future research can examine antecedents and consequences of the MEF model in different cultures, which may incorporate different goal and means contents. Recent research assessing 1.2 million students in 59 societies suggests that what increases intrinsic motivation in one culture may be different in another (Li et al., 2021]]). Specifically, whereas passion (interest, enjoyment, and self-efficacy) is important in individualistic cultures and is strongly associated with achievement in science, math, and reading, the same is not true in collectivist cultures. Collectivist cultures value contributing to familial success and well-being; in such cultures, parental support increased intrinsic motivation, and thus, parental support predicted achievement as much as passion.

Related to these findings, cultural differences also moderate the effect of providing free choice on experiencing intrinsic motivation. European American children performed best on puzzles they chose themselves (vs. ones their parents or an experimenter chose). However, Asian American children solved more puzzles that their parents chose (vs. ones they or an experimenter chose). Personal choice was critical for motivation among European Americans; Asian Americans were more driven by a desire to meet family expectations (Iyengar & Lepper, 1999]]).

To date, most of the research testing the MEF model has focused on individualistic cultures. Thus, a fruitful avenue for future research is to examine whether, regardless of culturally valued means, intrinsic motivation results from a strong means–end association. Such research is needed to examine the role of culture when conceptualizing the various goals people hold and the relationship between their actions and these goals.

Second, more work is needed to understand when a justification for engaging in an action becomes an overjustification and undermines intrinsic motivation. That is, the MEF model proposes and finds that adding earlier rewards is motivating when rewards are already associated with an activity, yet other research finds that adding rewards can reduce intrinsic motivation when rewards are not already associated with an activity. Because most activities people engage in come with some form of reward (i.e., people work for payment), the addition of rewards is unlikely to undermine intrinsic motivation, and earlier rewards can serve to strengthen it. However, when activities are not associated with rewards (i.e., donation behavior), adding extrinsic motivators, such as incentives, may reduce motivation via dilution.

In this vein, adding goals can increase intrinsic motivation, so long as they do not change the meaning behind engaging in an activity. As an illustration, paid firefighters were more motivated when they held both intrinsic and prosocial motivation to work (Grant, 2008]]). However, West Point cadets were less motivated when they held both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to work (Wrzesniewski et al., 2014]]). Conceptually, the MEF model can help make sense of these seemingly contradictory findings. Possibly, prosocial motivation is strongly associated with serving as a firefighter, such that adding prosocial motivation does not detract from intrinsic motivation. However, for West point cadets, adding an extrinsic motive that was less strongly associated with their service may have undermined their motivation. More research is needed to formally test these assumptions to provide a fuller understanding of when overjustification occurs, in order to develop interventions to successfully increase intrinsic motivation.

### Conclusion

We describe a new and exciting look at intrinsic motivation—the MEF model—which was heavily inspired by work over the past 20+ years on goal systems theory. According to this model, intrinsic motivation arrives from the strong association between an activity and its goal (i.e., means-end fusion). When actions are closely associated with their goals, either by uniqueness, repeated pairing, similarity, or immediacy of means and ends, the resulting fusion causes greater intrinsic motivation.

The Structure of Immersive and Engaging Activities](04_Contents1.xhtml#n0005)

Insights from a Computational Model of Flow

David Melnikoff, Ryan Carlson, and Paul Stillman

Too often, activities feel dull and boring. Office meetings, homework assignments, fitness routines—ideally, such activities would spark deep, immersive engagement, but they rarely do. How can tasks be designed to foster more engagement and less boredom?

Answering this question requires a mechanistic understanding of how the experience of immersion and engagement—commonly known as _flow_ (Csikszentmihalyi, [^1975], [^1990]; Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014]])—relates to mental representations of task structure. To see what we mean, consider the following scenario. A teacher must choose between two classroom activities designed to teach students vocabulary. Both activities involve answering vocabulary questions on a computer and use points to incentivize accuracy. In one activity, each question starts with a statement of the form “The word X means Y” and asks “Is this statement true or false?” Correct answers are worth 4 points, and incorrect answers are worth 0 points. In the other activity, each question consists of four words and four definitions, which must be arranged into correct word–definition pairs; each correct pair is worth 1 point.

Which activity would feel more immersive and engaging? Without a theory of how flow interacts with representations of task structure, this question is unanswerable. Indeed, what distinguishes the two activities are their structures: They involve different actions (i.e., responding “true” or “false” vs. matching words to definitions), different outcomes, (i.e., binary outcomes of 0 or 4 points vs. non-binary outcomes of 0, 1, 2, or 4 points), and different action–outcome contingencies (i.e., 4 points per correct answer vs. 1 point per correct answer).

Traditional theories of flow offer little insight into the relationship between flow and representations of task structure, posing an obstacle to harnessing flow in daily life. In the present chapter, we address this obstacle by proposing a computational account of how representations of task structure shape subjective experiences of immersion and engagement.

Our framework draws on an approach to motivation called _goal systems theory_, which casts motivation in terms of mental representations of desired end states and means of attaining them (see the Introduction and Chapter 1]] in this volume; Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2015]). Research inspired by goal systems theory has produced two insights of particular relevance to the present analysis. One is a computational model of flow whose formal structure permits quantitatively precise predictions about immersion and engagement (Melnikoff, Carlson, & Stillman, 2022]]). The other is a taxonomy of ways in which people represent task structure (see Introduction and Chapter 1]] in this volume; Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2015]). Integrating these insights yields a generative framework for understanding how representations of task structure shape flow.

This chapter proceeds as follows. First, we describe the goal systemic approach to flow and the evidence supporting it. Second, we describe the goal systemic approach to representing task structure. Finally, we combine these approaches to forge novel connections between representations of task structure and flow—connections with the potential to help people harness flow in their daily lives.

### A Goal Systemic Approach to Flow

Prominent theories of flow have proposed several factors that can promote flow, such as the balance between the challenge of a task and the skill of the person completing it (Csikszentmihalyi, [^1975], [^1990]; Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014]]). Though such theories have been highly influential, they are limited by their reliance on verbal descriptions of concepts that are difficult to define and measure (cf. Wojtowicz et al., 2019]]; Agrawal et al., 2022]]). This limitation makes it difficult to tailor tasks to maximize flow in a systematic fashion.

Addressing this, we recently developed, and empirically tested, a new formalization of the flow-generating process. Our approach draws on a recent extension of goal systems theory to the topic of intrinsic motivation (Fishbach & Woolley, 2022]]; Kruglanski et al., 2018]]; see Chapter 3]] in this volume). Though distinct, flow and intrinsic motivation are connected as flow is commonly experienced during intrinsically motivated activity (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975]]; Keller & Bless, 2008]]). Accordingly, we used the goal systemic approach to intrinsic motivation to guide and constrain our search for a computational account of flow.

The goal systemic approach states that intrinsic motivation emerges from _means–end fusion_—the degree to which mental representations of goals (e.g., to bowl a strike) and means of attaining them (e.g., rolling a bowling ball) are associated. The idea is that the more a means and end are associated—or “fused” into a unified representation—the more intrinsic motivation the means evokes. Consistent with this idea, factors that strengthen mental associations between means and ends have been found to increase intrinsic motivation. For instance, drawing on evidence that mental associations between events grow stronger with the temporal proximity of those events, Woolley and Fishbach (2018)]] manipulated the temporal delay between various means (e.g., completing a survey) and ends (e.g., receiving chocolate). Shorter temporal delays resulted in greater intrinsic motivation, in line with the idea that intrinsic motivation increases with means–end fusion (see also Westgate & Wilson, 2018]]).

The concept of means–end fusion bears a striking resemblance to an important quantity in the field of artificial intelligence: the mutual information between actions and end states (Klyubin et al., 2005]]; Salge et al., 2014]]). Mutual information quantifies the degree of association between two random variables (Shannon, 1948]]). Accordingly, the mutual information between actions and end states can be interpreted as the associative strength, or fusion, between means and ends. Of the many possible ways to quantify fusion between means and ends, mutual information is a particularly promising candidate. Artificial agents programmed to seek out states where they can maximize the mutual information between their actions and end states behave much like intrinsically motivated humans: They learn, explore, and act meaningfully in the absence of external rewards and punishments (Gregor et al., 2016]]; Jung et al., 2011]]; Karl et al., 2017]]; Mohamed & Rezende, 2015]]; Qureshi et al., 2018]]; Tiomkin et al., 2017]]).

The parallels between means–end fusion, on the one hand, and the mutual information between means and ends, on the other hand, led us to integrate these concepts into a computational theory of flow. In broad strokes, our account says that flow is an increasing function of the mutual information between two random variables, _E_ and _M_, which roughly correspond to desired end states and means of attaining them, respectively. As the mutual information between _E_ and _M_ increases, so does the degree of flow experienced while performing the activity. We call this the _informational theory of flow_. Next, we define _M_ and _E_ and show how the mutual information between them is computed.

#### Defining _M_ and _E_

Our theory conceives of flow as a function of two key variables: _M_, which denotes a state brought about to achieve a goal, and _E_, which denotes an outcome of goal pursuit. Since activities can be represented in multiple ways (Vallacher & Wegner, 1987]]), _M_ and _E_ depend on an individual’s subjective construal. For instance, in a game where players receive money for every ball they toss through a hoop, one player might construe _M_ and _E_ as binary variables (reflecting whether they made or missed the shot and whether money was received or not, respectively), whereas another player might construe _M_ and _E_ as continuous variables (reflecting the ball’s proximity to the hoop and the amount of money received, respectively).

#### Defining the Mutual Information Between _M_ and _E_

The mutual information between _M_ and _E_, or _I(M_;_E_), quantifies the average amount of uncertainty about _E_ that is reduced by observing _M_. For instance, in the ball-tossing game, _I(M_;_E_) quantifies the average amount of uncertainty about reward (i.e., whether money will be received or not) that is reduced by observing whether a shot was made or missed. _I(M_;_E_) is maximized under the following conditions: (1) before observing _M_, the value of _E_ is completely uncertain (e.g., before making or missing the shot, the subjective probability of receiving money is 50%) and (2) after observing _M_, the value of _E_ is completely certain (e.g., after making or missing a shot, the subjective probability of receiving money is 100% or 0%). By contrast, _I(M_;_E_) is minimized when the value of _M_ has no bearing on the value of _E_ (e.g., if making vs. missing a shot has no bearing on reward).

In more formal terms, two key factors govern _I(M_;_E_) in any task. One is the subjective probability of each possible value of _M_, denoted as _p__M_(_m_). For instance, in the ball-tossing game, _p__M_(_m_) denotes the subjective probability of making or missing a shot; if the probability of making a shot is 50%, then _p__M_(_make_) = .5 and _p__M_(_miss_) = .5. The other key factor is the subjective probability of each possible value of _E_ conditional on each possible value of _M_, denoted a _p__E_|_M_(_e_|_m_). In the ball-tossing game, _p__E_|_M_(_e_ | _m_) denotes the subjective probability of receiving a dollar (or not) conditional on making (or missing) a shot; if makes are always rewarded and misses never rewarded, then _p__E_|_M_($1| _make_) = 1, _p__E_|_M_($1| _miss_) = 0, _p__E_|_M_($0| _make_) = 0, and _p__E_|_M_($0| _miss_) = 1. Using _p__M_(_m_) and _p__E_|_M_(_e_|_m_), _I(M_;_E_) can be computed as follows:

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-math-001.gif) (1)

In Equation 1]], _p__E_|_M_ (_e_,_m_) = _p__E_|_M_ (_e_|_m_) _p__M_(_m_) and ![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-math-002.gif). The informational theory of flow says that flow is a monotonically increasing function of _I(M_;_E_).

#### Evidence for the Informational Theory of Flow

We recently obtained empirical support for the informational theory of flow across five experiments (Melnikoff et al., 2022]]). Most experiments used a computer-based task in which _p__M_(_m_) and _p__E_|_M_(_e_| _m_) can be precisely manipulated. On each trial, a tile appears at the center of the screen, and participants have a limited amount of time to “activate” the tile by pressing their spacebar. If the spacebar is pressed in time, the tile changes color, indicating that it was activated. If the spacebar is not pressed in time, the tile disappears from the screen and can no longer be activated. Whether or not the tile is activated determines the probability of winning a “jackpot” on the current trial. If a participant wins a jackpot, the next screen displays a pleasant image indicating that $0.10 was added to the participant’s “bonus fund,” which participants receive at the end of the study. If a jackpot is not won, the next screen displays an unpleasant image indicating that $0 was added to the player’s bonus fund.

In the tile game, _M_ has two possible values: _M_ = _hit_ if the tile is activated, _M_ = _miss_ if the tile is not activated. _E_ also has two possible values: _E_ = _jackpot_ if a jackpot is received, and _E_ = _no jackpot_ if a jackpot is not received. For simplicity, the value of _p__E_|_M_ (_jackpot_ | _miss_) in the tile game is constrained to equal 1– _p__E_|_M_ (_jackpot_ | _hit_). Accordingly, in the tile game, _I(M_;_E_) is a function of just two parameters: _p__M_(_hit_) and _p__E_|_M_(_jackpot_ | _hit_).

To manipulate _p__M_(_hit_), we included two types of trials: hit trials, where participants had 750 ms to activate the tile (practically guaranteeing a hit), and miss trials, where participants had only 250 ms to activate the tile (practically guaranteeing a miss). Accordingly, in the tile game, manipulating _p__M_(_hit_) boils down to manipulating the percentage of trials that are hit trials. To manipulate _p__E_|_M_ (_jackpot_ | _hit_), participants are simply told the probability of attaining a jackpot conditional on activating versus not activating the tile. The true probabilities always match these instructions.

In an initial test of the informational theory of flow, participants played the tile game with randomly selected values of _p__M_(_hit_) and _p__E_|_M_(_jackpot_ | _hit_). Participants then self-reported the degree to which they experienced flow. In line with the informational theory of flow, self-reported flow was a positive function of _I(M_;_E_). Subsequent experiments found that _I(M_;_E_) predicts not only flow but also enjoyment, attention, and lower response times.

_I(M_;_E_) was pitted against several alternative constructs identified by other theories as potential contributors to flow: (1) self-reported skill–challenge balance (i.e., the degree to which participants reported that the tile game had the ideal level of difficulty; see Csikszentmihalyi, 1975]]; Keller & Bless, 2008]]; Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014]]), (2) subjective controllability (i.e., the degree to which participants reported feeling in control of their outcomes during the tile game; see Csikszentmihalyi, 1975]]; Keller & Bless, 2008]]; Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014]]), and (3) the value of information (i.e., the financial value of the information participants could expect to obtain on a given trial of the tile game; see Agrawal et al., 2022]]). None of these variables predicted flow as reliably as _I(M_;_E_). We also pitted _I(M_;_E_) against other, plausible contributors to flow not emphasized by existing theories: (1) expected value (i.e., the average amount of money a player could expect to earn on a given trial of the tile game), (2) marginal value (i.e., the degree to which succeeding vs. failing to activate the tile on a given trial increased expected financial return), (3) reward prediction error (i.e., the average difference between actual and expected reward on each trial of the tile game; see Sutton & Barto, 2018]]), and (4) the linear correlation between _M_ and _E_. In addition to ruling out these alternative constructs, we generalized beyond the tile game by taking different, already-existing games, computing their values of _I(M_;_E_), and showing that the game with the most _I(M_;_E_) elicits the most flow.

To summarize, the informational theory of flow is a goal systemic approach to modeling the subjective experience of immersion and engagement. Its central claim—that flow is a monotonically increasing function of _I(M_;_E_)—has received empirical support.

Having presented a computational model of flow, we next describe a framework for understanding how people represent task structure. We will use this framework, along with the informational theory of flow, to advance a formal account of how representations of task structure shape subjective experiences of immersion and engagement.

### A Goal Systemic Approach to Representing Task Structure

Work on goal systems theory divides representations of task structure into broad categories (see Chapter 1]] in this volume; Köpetz et al., 2012]]; Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2015]; Kruglanski & Köpetz, 2009]]). Each category reflects a different way in which means and ends can be configured. In the simplest configuration, a single means is represented as serving a single end. For instance, in the tile game used to test the informational theory of flow, participants are encouraged to represent the single means of tile-activation as serving the single end of jackpot-winning. This configuration is called the _unifinality configuration_.

Means–end configurations need not be so simple. For instance, in a multifinality configuration, a single means can be represented as serving multiple ends, as when the means of exercising is seen as serving the dual ends of losing weight and improving cardiovascular conditioning. In a third configuration—the _equifinality configuration_—multiple means are represented as serving a single end. For instance, someone could see the dual means of dieting and exercising as serving the single end of losing weight.

Different means–end configurations have different implications for motivation. For instance, the subjective value of pursuing a means in a multifinality configuration tends to be greater than the subjective value of pursuing a means in a unifinality configuration (see Chapter 1]] in this volume; Chun et al., 2011]]; Kruglanski et al., [^2013], [^2015]). On the other hand, when a means appears in a multifinality configuration, it tends to be considered less instrumental for goal attainment than when it appears in a unifinality configuration (Zhang et al., 2007]]). Another factor sensitive to means–end configurations is goal commitment. For instance, commitment to goals in equifinality configurations tends to be greater than commitment to goals in unifinality configurations (Kruglanski et al., 2011]]).

Perhaps flow, in addition to subjective value and goal commitment, is sensitive to means–end configurations. Or, in the language of the informational theory of flow, perhaps the configuration of means and ends influences _I(M_;_E_). It turns out that _I(M_;_E_) does indeed vary across means–end configurations and systemically so, permitting precise predictions about the consequences of means–end configurations for immersion and engagement. In what follows, we illustrate exactly how _I(M_;_E_) varies across means–end configurations and discuss implications for flow.

### The Information Theoretic Properties of Means–End Configurations and Their Implications for Flow

To understand how means–end configurations shape _I(M_;_E_), it will be useful to consider the following expression:

 ![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-math-003.gif) (2)

In this expression, _prior uncertainty_ refers to the degree of uncertainty about _E_ prior to observing _M_. Recall our ball-tossing game, in which players are rewarded for tossing a ball through a hoop. In this game, prior uncertainty is the degree of uncertainty about whether or not a reward will be received prior to tossing the ball. Prior uncertainty is maximized if, prior to tossing the ball, the probability of reward is 50%. As the prior probability of reward approaches 0% or 100%, prior uncertainty decreases. Equation 2]] says that, all else being equal, the greater the value of prior uncertainty, the greater the value of _I(M_;_E_). This reflects the fact that _I(M_;_E_) quantifies the degree to which observing _M_ reduces uncertainty about _E_; the more uncertain _E_ is to start with, the more uncertainty there is to reduce.

In Equation 2]], _posterior uncertainty_ is the average amount of uncertainty about _E_ that remains after observing _M_. In the ball-tossing game, posterior uncertainty is the amount of uncertainty about reward that remains after making or missing the shot. If makes are always rewarded and misses never rewarded, posterior uncertainty would be 0, since knowing whether a shot is made or missed would eliminate all uncertainty about reward. If rewards are administered randomly regardless of whether the shot is made or missed, posterior uncertainty would equal prior uncertainty, since knowing whether a shot is made or missed would eliminate zero uncertainty about whether a reward will be received. Finally, if makes are usually rewarded but occasionally not and misses occasionally rewarded but usually not, then posterior uncertainty would be greater than 0 but less than prior uncertainty, since knowing whether a shot is made or missed would eliminate some, but not all, uncertainty about reward. Equation 2]] says that, all else being equal, the smaller the value of posterior uncertainty, the greater the value of _I(M_;_E_).

Technically, prior uncertainty is quantified as the Shannon entropy of _E_ and posterior uncertainty as the Shannon entropy of _E_ conditional on _M_. However, for our purposes, these mathematical details are unimportant. It will suffice to know two things: (1) _I(M_;_E_) increases with prior uncertainty, which is the degree of uncertainty about _E_ prior to observing _M_, and (2) _I(M_;_E_) decreases with posterior uncertainty, which is the degree of uncertainty about _E_ after observing _M_. Critically, it is by altering prior and posterior uncertainty that means–end configurations alter _I(M_;_E_).

#### Three Helpful Heuristics

The only way to determine the exact amount of _I(M_;_E_) in a given configuration is to compute it. However, one does not need a calculator to intuit, in broad strokes, whether _I(M_;_E_) in a given configuration is relatively high or low. All one needs are three simple heuristics. Specifically, we have identified three heuristics that can be used to judge, with reasonable precision, how prior and posterior uncertainty, and therefore _I(M_;_E_), changes across different means–end configurations of an activity. These heuristics, which we present below (see Figure 4.1]]), will anchor our analysis of how representations of task structure shape flow.

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-008-colour.gif)

Figure 4.1 Three heuristics for how representations of task structure shape flow. The cardinality heuristic (A) states that flow should increase as the number of possible values of _E_ increases (e.g., considering one’s finishing positions instead of just winning vs. losing). The uniformity heuristic (B) states that flow should increase when the probability distribution over _E_ approaches uniformity (e.g., a 50% chance of winning or losing). The diagnosticity heuristic (C) states that flow should increase as _M_ becomes more diagnostic of _E_.

##### The Cardinality Heuristic

Consider an athlete training for a race. For this athlete, _E_ denotes whether or not they win the race. In this configuration, _E_ can assume one of two values (i.e., _win_ or _lose_). We call this the configuration’s _cardinality_: the number of unique values the random variable _E_ can assume.

The cardinality of a means–end configuration places an upper bound on _I(M_;_E_). Specifically, the greater the cardinality of a configuration, the more prior uncertainty that configuration can have, so the more _I(M_;_E_) that configuration can have. This feature of cardinality leads to a simple rule of thumb: Increasing cardinality tends to increase _I(M_;_E_) by increasing prior uncertainty. Call this the _cardinality heuristic_ (see Figure 4.1A]]).

If our athlete wished to boost the amount of _I(M_;_E_) in their means–end configuration, they could employ the cardinality heuristic as follows: Instead of setting a goal to win the race, set a goal to place as high as possible. Under this alternative framing, _E_ no longer denotes whether the race was won or lost but in what position the athlete finished (e.g., first, second, third)—a variable that can assume as many values as there are competitors in the race. Assuming the athlete has more than one competitor, letting _E_ denote finishing position would increase cardinality, thereby increasing the upper bound on _I(M_;_E_).

##### The Uniformity Heuristic

Suppose our athlete, ignoring the cardinality heuristic, adopts the binary goal of winning the race. Also suppose that our athlete thinks they have a 50% chance of winning: _p__E_(_win_) = .5. In this scenario, _p__E_(_e_) is a uniform distribution: Every possible value of _E_—_win_ and _lose_—has the same probability. _p__E_(_e_) would cease to be uniform if the athlete were any more or less certain about the outcome of the race: The closer _p__E_(_win_) gets to 1 or 0, the less uniform _p__E_(_e_) becomes.

The uniformity of _p__E_(_e_) upper-bounds _I(M_;_E_); the closer _p__E_(_e_) is to uniform, the higher _I(M_;_E_) can be. Specifically, the closer _p__E_(_e_) is to uniform, the more prior uncertainty a configuration can have, so the more _I(M_;_E_) a configuration can have. Therefore, as a general rule, _I(M_;_E_) will tend to increase as _p__E_(_e_) becomes more uniform (see Figure 4.1B]]).

##### The Diagnosticity Heuristic

Suppose that our athlete’s goal of winning is served by the means of training, such that _M_ denotes the number of days that the athlete fulfills their training plan. Presumably, the athlete picked a training plan that they believe will impact their performance. In other words, the athlete presumably thinks that _M_ is diagnostic of _E_ (i.e., the amount of training they do is diagnostic of whether they will win or lose). One could imagine, however, a case where _M_ is viewed as non-diagnostic. Perhaps the athlete believes that the outcome of the race is determined by so many random factors that adhering to their training plan, at best, explains only a small amount of variance in the outcome. These alternative scenarios describe means–end configurations in which _M_ is characterized by different degrees of diagnosticity.

The diagnosticity of _M_ upper-bounds _I(M_;_E_); the more diagnostic _M_ is of _E_, the higher _I(M_;_E_) can be. Specifically, the more diagnostic _M_ is, the lower a configuration’s posterior uncertainty can be, so the more _I(M_;_E_) that configuration can have. Therefore, as a general rule, _I(M_;_E_) will tend to increase as _M_ becomes more diagnostic of _E_ (see Figure 4.1C]]).

#### Multifinality Configurations and _I(M_;_E_)

Having provided tools for intuiting how _I(M_;_E_) changes across means–end configurations, we turn to the specific question of how _I(M_;_E_) relates to multifinality configurations. How does _I(M_;_E_) change when a means serves not just one end but many? The answer is nuanced. Multifinality configurations can increase _I(M_;_E_), decrease _I(M_;_E_), or have no effect on _I(M_;_E_), depending on how they influence prior and posterior uncertainty.

To illustrate the various ways in which multifinality configurations can alter _I(M_;_E_), we will use the running example of a die-rolling game. After describing a unifinality configuration of the die-rolling game, we will describe two multifinality configurations, which alter _I(M_;_E_) in different ways that can be understood in terms of the above-mentioned heuristics.

##### Die-Rolling Game: Unifinality Configuration

The game that will serve as our running example uses a die with four sides, each labeled with a number from 1 to 4. In the unifinality configuration, rolling an even number yields a toy, and rolling an odd number yields nothing. This configuration involves a single means (die-rolling) and a single end (toy-winning) (Figure 4.2]]).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-009.gif)

Figure 4.2 Unifinality configuration of the die-rolling game. The single means of die-rolling serves the single end of toy-winning.

To compute _I(M_;_E_), we need to define the random variables _M_ and _E_, along with their joint probability distribution. In the unifinality configuration of the die-rolling game, _E_ can assume two values, each corresponding to a possible end state—![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-math-004.gif)—and _M_ can assume four values, each corresponding to a number on the die—![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-math-005.gif). Assuming the die is fair (i.e., each value of _M_ is equally probable), the joint distribution over _M_ and _E_ is given in Table 4.1]].

Table 4.1 Joint and Marginal Probability Distributions for the Unifinality Configuration of the Die-Rolling Game

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
||_E_|   ||
|_M_|No prize|Toy|_p__M_(m)|
|1|.25|0|.25|
|2|0|.25|.25|
|3|.25|0|.25|
|4|0|.25|.25|
|_p__E_(e)|.5|.5||

Inputting the values in Table 4.1]] into Equation 1]], we find that, in the unifinality configuration of the die-rolling game, _I_(_M_;_E_) = 1. Having specified the unifinality configuration of the die-rolling game, we now consider various multifinality configurations.

##### Die-Rolling Game: Multifinality Configuration 1

Consider a configuration of the die-rolling game in which die-rolling determines not only whether the player wins a toy but also whether the player wins candy. In this multifinality configuration, the means of die-rolling serves two ends: toy-winning and candy-winning (Figure 4.3]]).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-010.gif)

Figure 4.3 Multifinality configuration of the die-rolling game. The single means of die-rolling serves two ends: toy-winning and candy-winning.

Specifically, rolls of 1 are rewarded with nothing, rolls of 2 are rewarded with a toy only, rolls of 3 are rewarded with candy only, and rolls of 4 are rewarded with both a toy and candy (Table 4.2]]). This is the first of two multifinality configurations we will consider, and we label it _MC-1_ (multifinality configuration 1).

Table 4.2 Joint and Marginal Probability Distributions for MC-1

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||_E_|   |   |   ||
|_M_|No prize|Toy|Candy|Toy and candy|_p__M_(m)|
|1|.25|0|0|0|.25|
|2|0|.25|0|0|.25|
|3|0|0|.25|0|.25|
|4|0|0|0|.25|.25|
|_p__E_(e)|.25|.25|.25|.25||

MC-1 follows all three of our helpful heuristics. It doubles the cardinality of the unifinality configuration from two to four, places a uniform distribution over _E_, and makes _M_ perfectly diagnostic of _E_. So, it should come as no surprise that, relative to the unifinality configuration, MC-1 has more _I(M_;_E_). Specifically, in MC-1, _I(M_;_E_) = 2, double the amount from the unifinality configuration.

Another way to understand this result is in terms of prior and posterior uncertainty. Compared to the unifinality configuration, MC-1 has more prior uncertainty and the same amount of posterior uncertainty. Posterior uncertainty is identical across the two configurations because they follow the diagnosticity heuristic to the same degree. Specifically, in both configurations, _M_ is perfectly diagnostic of _E_, setting posterior uncertainty equal to 0.

Prior uncertainty is greater in MC-1 because MC-1 has greater cardinality and the same degree of uniformity. Specifically, in MC-1, _E_ is uniformly distributed over four possible values, whereas, in the unifinality configuration, _E_ is uniformly distributed over two possible values. By introducing additional values of _E_, MC-1 effectively “dilutes” prior certainty about any particular value of _E_ being realized.

As illustrated by MC-1, switching from a unifinality configuration to a multifinality configuration can increase _I(M_;_E_), especially when the multifinality configuration follows the cardinality, uniformity, and diagnosticity heuristics. However, there is no guarantee that a multifinality configuration will increase _I(M_;_E_). A multifinality configuration that reduces _I(M_;_E_) is considered next.

##### Die-Rolling Game: Multifinality Configuration 2

The next multifinality configuration, MC-2, decreases _I(M_;_E_) relative to the unifinality configuration. In MC-2, rolling an even number yields a 100% chance of winning both a toy and candy, and rolling an odd number yields a 40% chance of winning a toy and candy and a 60% chance of winning nothing (Table 4.3]]).

Table 4.3 Joint and Marginal Probability Distributions for MC-2

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
||_E_|   ||
|_M_|No prize|Toy and candy|_p__M_(m)|
|1|.15|.1|.25|
|2|0|.25|.25|
|3|.15|.1|.25|
|4|0|.25|.25|
|_p__E_(e)|.3|.7||

In MC-2, cardinality is 2, _p__E_(_e_) is non-uniform, and _M_ is not perfectly diagnostic of _E_. These features conspire to decrease prior uncertainty and increase posterior uncertainty relative to the unifinality configuration. This is why, in MC-2, _I(M_;_E_) ≈ .4—far less than in the unifinality configuration. Next, we consider how _I(M_;_E_) in MC-2 is influenced by each heuristic.

MC-2 violates the diagnosticity heuristic: Knowing the value of _M_ does not necessarily reduce all uncertainty about _E_. This stems from the fact that odd numbers result in a 60/40 chance of winning a toy and candy, instead of determining the outcome with complete reliability. As a result, posterior uncertainty, and therefore _I(M_;_E_), is higher in MC-2 relative to the unifinality configuration. This result aligns with a common finding from work on goal systems theory: Unifinal means (means that serve a single goal) are often more motivating than multifinal means (means that serve multiple goals) (see Chapter 1]] in this volume; Kruglanski et al., [^2013], [^2015]; Zhang et al., 2007]]). This effect, known as the _dilution effect_, occurs because the single means–end association in a unifinal configuration is typically viewed as stronger than the multiple means–end associations in a multifinality configuration. In the language of the diagnosticity heuristic, people have a tendency to think of _M_ as less diagnostic of _E_ in multifinality configurations relative to unifinality configurations, resulting in lower _I(M_;_E_).

In addition to violating the diagnosticity heuristic, MC-2 violates the uniformity heuristic as most of the probability mass is over one of the two possible values of _E_: _toy and candy_. Compared to the unifinality configuration, where both possible values of _E_ are equally likely, the non-uniformity of MC-2 may seem preferable as it increases the likelihood of a reward. However, making one outcome likelier than another necessarily comes at the cost of _I(M_;_E_). Accordingly, in order to maximize _I(M_;_E_), one must be willing to sacrifice expected value. This principle aligns with previous research indicating that when tasks are too easy or too difficult, flow tends to suffer (Csikszentmihalyi, [^1975], [^1990]; Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2014]]; see also Wilson et al., 2019).

Finally, in MC-2, cardinality is 2 rather than 4 because the two ends—toy-winning and candy-winning—are perfectly correlated. Unlike MC-1, MC-2 offers no chance of winning a toy but not candy or winning candy but not a toy. This illustrates an important principle of multifinality configurations: When the ends in a multifinality configuration always co-occur, that configuration will tend to have relatively low cardinality and, therefore, relatively low _I(M_;_E_). This insight is applicable to many familiar activities. For instance, consider a student whose goal is to pass their exam by means of studying. The student’s instructor could induce a multifinality configuration by offering a gold star to anyone who passes. However, in this configuration, the ends of exam-passing and star-winning are perfectly aligned, just as toy-winning and candy-winning are perfectly aligned in MC-2. This would result in a multifinality configuration with the same amount of _I(M_;_E_) as the original, unifinality configuration. If the goal of obtaining a gold star is to boost _I(M_;_E_), the ends of star-winning and exam-passing must be less than perfectly correlated. This could be achieved by making star-winning contingent not on passing the exam but on getting the highest grade in the class. This policy makes it possible to pass the exam without getting a gold star (like in MC-1, where it is possible to win a toy without getting candy). The result would be a multifinality configuration with greater cardinality than the unifinality configuration and greater _I(M_;_E_).

#### Multifinality Configurations and Flow

The preceding examples illustrate a simple rule governing whether, and to what extent, a multifinality configuration will increase _I(M_;_E_): A multifinality configuration, like any means–end configuration, will increase _I(M_;_E_) to the extent that it increases prior uncertainty relative to posterior uncertainty. We also illustrated three heuristics, that, when followed, will often boost _I(M_;_E_): the cardinality, uniformity, and diagnosticity heuristics.

The above insights, in conjunction with the informational theory of flow, lead to a straightforward prediction about the relationship between flow and multifinality configurations: A multifinality configuration should increase flow to the extent that it increases prior uncertainty relative to posterior uncertainty. This prediction has not been tested directly. However, indirect support can be obtained by considering common strategies for making everyday activities more flow-inducing. Some of the most popular strategies, it turns out, introduce multifinality configurations characterized by high prior uncertainty and low posterior uncertainty.

Consider the strategy of _gamification_—the application of game design elements, such as points and leaderboards, to non-game contexts (Deterding et al., 2011]]; Seaborn & Fels, 2015]]). Gamification is a popular approach to promoting immersion and engagement across a wide range of domains, including work, education, and fitness. To illustrate, consider the gamified workouts millions of people complete every day with Peloton, an exercise equipment and media company that lets people remotely participate in fitness classes. Peloton awards points based on aerobic output; the greater a user’s aerobic output, the more points they earn. The points are used for two things: (1) to rank people on a leaderboard and (2) to award “personal best” badges for high scores. This introduces a multifinality configuration in which the means of earning points serves the dual ends of getting a high score and securing a high leaderboard position. This configuration is ideal for inducing high prior uncertainty and low posterior uncertainty as it adheres to the cardinality, uniformity, and diagnosticity heuristics.

It is easy to show that a Peloton’s gamified workouts have high cardinality: _E_ can assume hundreds of different values. Specifically, _E_ can assume any value from the set consisting of every combination of (1) final leaderboard position and (2) achieving versus not achieving a high score: {_1st and high score_, _1st and no high score_, _2nd and high score_, _2nd and no high score_ . . . _last place and high score_, _last place and no high score_}. This set can have hundreds of elements. By allowing _E_ to assume so many different values, Peloton’s gamified workouts epitomize the cardinality heuristic. This is true of almost any gamified activity; if _E_ denotes values that depend on leaderboard position, cardinality will be high, assuming a reasonable range of leaderboard positions.

In addition to following the cardinality heuristic, Peloton’s gamified workouts follow the uniformity heuristic. As a general rule, there are many plausible combinations of leaderboard positions and achieving versus not achieving one’s personal best. This is because the correlation between leaderboard position and achieving a high score is fairly low; knowing whether or not someone performed their best on something explains a small amount of variance in where, exactly, that person ranks among a large group of competitors. For example, knowing that Jane failed to run her best marathon time says fairly little about where, exactly, Jane placed. Jane could have missed her best time by a little or a lot—without knowing her exact time, it is difficult to guess her position. So, when _E_ denotes the conjunction of leaderboard position and achieving versus not achieving one’s personal best (as in almost any gamified activity), _E_ will have a reasonably uniform distribution.

This brings us to the diagnosticity heuristic. In Peloton’s gamified workouts, _M_ is highly diagnostic of _E_. Specifically, the number of points a person earns is highly diagnostic of that person’s leaderboard position and perfectly diagnostic of whether or not that person will achieve a high score. This is a general property of gamified systems: The number of points a person earns perfectly predicts whether that person achieves a high score and reliably predicts that person’s leaderboard position.

The preceding analysis of gamification supports the idea that multifinality configurations boost flow when they boost _I(M_;_E_). Specifically, we showed that gamification involves multifinality configurations in which cardinality and uniformity are high, and _M_ is highly diagnostic of _E_—features associated with high prior and low posterior uncertainty. In short, gamification—a popular and effective means of promoting immersion and engagement—involves multifinality configurations that induce high levels of _I(M_;_E_).

#### Equifinality Configurations and _I(M_;_E_)

We turn now to the question of how equifinality configurations impact _I(M_;_E_). How does _I(M_;_E_) change when an end is served not by one means but many? The answer again depends on the relative values of prior and posterior uncertainty. To the extent that equifinality increases prior uncertainty relative to posterior uncertainty, equifinality will increase _I(M_;_E_). Conversely, to the extent that equifinality decreases prior uncertainty relative to posterior uncertainty, equifinality will decrease _I(M_;_E_).

Like all means–end configurations, equifinality configurations will tend to boost _I(M_;_E_) to the extent that they adhere to the cardinality, uniformity, and diagnosticity heuristics. In what follows, we illustrate this dynamic using a new running example of a coin-flipping game. After describing a unifinality configuration of the coin-flipping game, we will describe two equifinality configurations, one that increases _I(M_;_E_) and one that decreases _I(M_;_E_).

##### Coin-Flipping Game: Unifinality Configuration

In the unifinality configuration of the coin-flipping game, a single flip of a fair coin determines how much money the flipper receives: Heads yields $1, and tails yields $4. This configuration involves a single means (coin-flipping) and a single end (money-winning) (Figure 4.4]]). The joint distribution over _M_ and _E_ is given in Table 4.4]].

Figure 4.4 Unifinality configuration of the coin-flipping game. The single means of coin-flipping serves the single end of money-winning.

Inputting the values in Table 4.4]] into Equation 1]], we find that, in the coin-flipping game, _I(M_;_E_) = 1. Having specified the unifinality configuration of the coin-flipping game, we now consider various equifinality configurations.

Table 4.4 Joint and Marginal Probability Distributions for the Unifinality Configuration of the Coin-Flipping Game

||_E_|   ||
|_M_|$1|$4|_p__M_(m)|
|Heads|.5|0|.5|
|Tails|0|.5|.5|
|_p__E_(e)|.5|.5||

##### Coin-Flipping Game: Equifinality Configuration 1

Consider a configuration of the coin-flipping game in which players have the option of flipping one of two fair coins: Coin 1 and Coin 2. If a player flips Coin 1, heads is worth $1 and tails $4; if a player flips Coin 2, heads is worth $2 and tails $3. In this equifinality configuration, two different means—flipping Coin 1 and flipping Coin 2—serve the same end of winning money (Figure 4.5]]). We label this equifinality configuration _EC-1_.

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-012.gif)

Figure 4.5 Equifinality configuration of the coin-flipping game. The two means of flipping coin 1 and flipping coin 2 serve the single end of money-winning.

In EC-1, we assume that players are uncertain about which coin to flip and choose between them at a 50/50 rate. Under this assumption, the joint probability distribution for EC-1 is given in Table 4.5]], where the state of Coin 1 coming up heads or tails is denoted _heads_1 and _tails_1, respectively, and the state of Coin 2 coming up heads or tails is denoted _heads_2 and _tails_2, respectively.

Table 4.5 Joint and Marginal Probability Distributions for EC-1

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||_E_|   |   |   ||
|_M_|$1|$2|$3|$4|_p__M_(m)|
|Heads1|.25|0|0|0|.25|
|Tails1|0|0|0|.25|.25|
|Heads2|0|.25|0|0|.25|
|Tails2|0|0|.25|0|.25|
|_p__E_(e)|.25|.25|.25|.25||

EC-1 is analogous to MC-1. It follows all three of our heuristics, doubling the cardinality of the unifinality configuration from 2 to 4, placing a uniform distribution over _E_, and making _M_ perfectly diagnostic of _E_. The result is an equifinality configuration with more _I(M_;_E_) than the unifinality configuration. Specifically, in EC-1, _I(M_;_E_) = 2. EC-1 has twice as much _I(M_;_E_) as the unifinality configuration of the coin-flipping game for the same reasons MC-1 has twice as much _I(M_;_E_) as the unifinality configuration of the die-rolling game: EC-1 has twice as much prior uncertainty and the same amount of posterior uncertainty.

As EC-1 illustrates, switching from a unifinality configuration to an equifinality configuration can increase _I(M_;_E_), especially when the equifinality configuration follows the cardinality, uniformity, and diagnosticity heuristics. However, there is no guarantee that an equifinality configuration will increase _I(M_;_E_). An equifinality configuration that reduces _I(M_;_E_) is considered next.

##### Coin-Flipping Game: Equifinality Configuration 2

The rules of the second equifinality configuration, EC-2, are as follows: Regardless of which coin is flipped, tails yields a 100% chance of winning $4, and heads yields a 40% of $4 and a 60% chance of $1 (Table 4.6]]).

Table 4.6 Joint and Marginal Probability Distributions for EC-2

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
||_E_|   ||
|_M_|$1|$4|_p__M_(m)|
|Heads1|.15|.1|.25|
|Tails1|0|.25|.25|
|Heads2|.15|.1|.25|
|Tails2|0|.25|.25|
|_p__E_(e)|.3|.7||

EC-2 is analogous to MC-2: Its cardinality is 2, _p__E_(_e_) is non-uniform, and _M_ is not perfectly diagnostic of _E_. These properties decrease prior uncertainty and increase posterior uncertainty, resulting in a value of _I(M_;_E_) ≈ .4—far less than the value of _I(M_;_E_) in the unifinality configuration. Equifinality configurations, like multifinality configurations, can have lower _I(M_;_E_) than unifinality configurations, especially when they violate the cardinality, uniformity, and diagnosticity heuristics.

The violation of the diagnosticity heuristic is straightforward: Flipping heads results in a 60/40 chance of winning $4, instead of guaranteeing a particular outcome. This increases posterior uncertainty and, therefore, decreases _I(M_;_E_), relative to the unifinality configuration. From the perspective of goal systems theory, EC-2 illustrates a phenomenon called the _less is more effect_, whereby increasing the number of means to a goal reduces the perceived instrumentality and, as a result, “dilutes” motivation (see Chapter 1]] in this volume; Bélanger et al., 2015]]; Zhang et al., 2007]]).

In addition to violating the diagnosticity heuristic, EC-2 violates the uniformity heuristic—a consequence of the fact that players are likelier to win $4 than $1. This is another illustration of the principle that _I(M_;_E_) is greatest when all possible values of _E_ are equally likely, even when this comes at the cost of expected value.

Finally, EC-2 violates the cardinality heuristic. Specifically, the cardinality of EC-2 is 2 rather than 4 because the two means produce identical outcomes. This illustrates a principle unique to equifinality configurations: _I(M_;_E_) in equifinality configurations will tend to be lower when the means are redundant versus non-redundant because redundancy reduces cardinality. This principle plays out in many familiar contexts. For instance, consider an investor presented with two means of making money: a risky means, such as investing in a startup company, and a conservative investment option, such as investing in a mutual fund. These means are non-redundant because they are expected to produce different outcomes, with the risky means tending to yield large gains or large losses and the conservative means tending to yield small gains and small losses. However, if instead of choosing between means that vary in risk, the investor considered a set of equally risky means, the investor’s equifinality configuration would be characterized by redundancy: No matter what means the investor chooses, they can expect the same outcome. As we have seen, if the investor wishes to maximize _I(M_;_E_), they would do well to consider a diverse set of investment options, some riskier than others.

#### Equifinality Configurations and Flow

The preceding examples illustrate the information theoretic properties of equifinality configurations. Fundamentally, these properties are the same as those of multifinality configurations. First, equifinality increases _I(M_;_E_) to the extent that it increases prior uncertainty relative to posterior uncertainty. Second, the effect of a given equifinality configuration on _I(M_;_E_) can be understood in terms of the cardinality, uniformity, and diagnosticity heuristics. The implications for flow are clear: If the informational theory of flow is correct, then equifinality should increase flow to the extent that it increases prior uncertainty relative to posterior uncertainty or, by the same token, to the extent that it follows the cardinality, uniformity, and diagnosticity heuristics.

What evidence is there that _I(M_;_E_) mediates the relationship between equifinality and flow? Some of the most popular games in the world share key features of EC-1, the coin-flipping game with the greatest amount of _I(M_;_E_). First, popular games often include a combination of high-risk, high-reward means (e.g., flipping Coin 1) and low-risk, low-reward means (e.g., flipping Coin 2). This feature, which contributes to high cardinality (because the outcomes of high-risk, high-reward means differ from those of low-risk, low-reward means), appears in games such as basketball, soccer, and American football. In basketball, for instance, players can choose between relatively risky 3-point shots and relatively conservative 2-point shots.

A second feature that some of the world’s most popular games share with EC-1 is a set of means that are similarly likely to be pursued. This feature promotes uniformity by ensuring that the outcomes of each means are similarly likely to occur. It can be found in basketball, where, as of the 2021 NBA season, players shot 3-pointers 40% of the time and 2-pointers 60% of the time (Sports Reference LLC, n.d.).

The third feature that popular games have in common with EC-1 is that they adhere to the diagnosticity heuristic: The value of _M_ determines, with a high-degree of certainty, the value of _E_. For example, in basketball, a successful 3-point shot always yields 3 points. It is hard to imagine a game that violates the diagnosticity heuristic gaining much of a following as such a game would violate a basic expectation of gameplay, embodied by the expression “may the best team win”: The winner of a game should almost always be the best performer.

Games are potent sources of flow (Deterding et al., 2011]]; Hamari et al., 2014]]; Mekler et al., 2017]]; Patten, 2021]]; Seaborn & Fels, 2015]]), and, as we have seen, some of the most popular games in the world include equifinality configurations with _I(M_;_E_)-boosting properties. Specifically, they possess a combination of high-risk, high-reward means and low-risk, low-reward means that are similarly attractive and highly diagnostic. This supports the prediction, derived from the informational theory of flow, that the relationship between flow and equifinality is mediated by _I(M_;_E_).

### Modeling Goal Systems

Thus far, we have discussed how goal systems theory inspired our computational model of flow and used its taxonomy of means–end configurations to forge connections between flow and representations of task structure. We conclude by discussing how our computational framework can help advance goal systems theory.

At the heart of goal systems theory is the concept of associations between mental representations of means and ends. It is in terms of means–end associations that the theory explains self-regulatory phenomena including commitment, choice, persistence, and effort (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]). Means–end fusion, which our model quantifies in terms of mutual information, merely describes a high level of associative strength. This raises the possibility that mutual information may be used to formalize not only the concept of means–end fusion but goal systems in general.

While this proposal remains preliminary, the goal systems approach has generated many empirical findings that are readily explained in terms of mutual information. For instance, Stillman and Woolley explored how mental associations between the means of eating sugar and negative end states (e.g., poorer health) undermine the enjoyment of indulging in sugary snacks. They found greater undermining of enjoyment when the means was associated with near-term negative outcomes (e.g., a sugar crash) relative to long-term negative outcomes (e.g., diabetes and heart disease). This finding was explained in terms of associative strength: Negative consequences expected to occur immediately were more strongly associated with the means than negative consequences expected to occur later. This explanation is easily restated in terms of mutual information: The choice to eat or not eat sugar provides more information about the probability of a sugar crash than it provides about the probability of long-term health outcomes. On this account, it is the mutual information between means and negative outcomes that determines the degree to which the negative outcome will undermine enjoyment of the means.

Critically, mutual information is one of many ways of quantifying associative strength. We have shown that it outperforms other metrics as a predictor of flow (Melnikoff et al., 2022]]), but it may not fare as well as a predictor of other self-regulatory phenomena. In other words, the goal systemic concept of a means–end association may be heterogeneous at the level of algorithm, such that different phenomena may reflect different computations of associative strength. Alternatively, the concept of means–end association may prove reducible, in its entirety, to mutual information. Testing between these possibilities would help uncover the computational foundations of goal systems, setting the stage for a deeper and more precise understanding of human motivation in general.

### Conclusion

We opened this chapter by asking if a teacher could identify which of two learning activities would induce more flow in her students. As a reminder, in one activity, students must identify statements of the form “The word X means Y” as true or false and receive 4 points for correct answers and 0 points for incorrect answers. In the other activity, students arrange four words and four definitions into pairs and receive 1 point for each correct word–definition pair. Traditional theories of flow lack the requisite precision to generate a priori predictions about which of these tasks would be more flow-inducing. In fact, it is unclear if any of the tasks in this chapter could be identified, a priori, as particularly conducive to flow or not using only traditional accounts of the flow-generating process. However, as demonstrated by the foregoing analysis, the informational theory of flow offers a clear answer: Flow should be highest in the pairing activity because the pairing activity has more _I(M_;_E_). This is a straightforward consequence of the fact that, in the pairing activity, _E_ has four possible values (0, 1, 2, or 4 points), and the true-or-false activity only has two (0 or 4 points).

What makes this prediction possible is our theory’s formal structure. Fundamentally, _I(M_;_E_) serves as a common currency for comparing representations of task structure in terms of their conduciveness to flow, regardless of how much they differ. To the extent that _I(M_;_E_) really does underlie flow, it also serves as an answer to the basic question of how representations of task structure and flow interact and as a tool that can help people harness flow in their daily lives. It remains to be seen whether the informational theory of flow stands up to empirical scrutiny, though initial tests give reason for optimism (Melnikoff et al., 2022]]). Regardless, testing the predictions presented in this chapter would yield valuable insights and, we believe, should be a major item on the agenda for future research.

How Goal Progress Changes the Drivers of Motivation

Szu-chi Huang

There’s the old adage that Rome wasn’t built in a day. So, too, achieving our valuable goals will take time. And as time passes, our environments change, our routines evolve, and new challenges begin to develop. Consider the pursuit of health. When we start to pursue this goal, we might experience high uncertainty and anxiety; there are many decisions to be made such as deciding the type and scope of this goal (e.g., blood pressure or weight loss, 3 pounds or 30 pounds). And there are many things to learn about how to best approach our goal, such as reading up on new diets and learning about the latest exercises. And just as we start to see progress, our confidence may turn into a new unexpected challenge; we feel that we can afford to skip our workout or sneak in a snack or two. And eventually, as we approach the finish line, impatience creeps up; we stop being excited about exploring new exercises or diets, and we just want to get it done.

In this chapter, I introduce the temporally dynamic goal pursuit model and discuss how this model complements and advances goal systems theory. This model proposes that goal pursuit is a dynamic process that spans from initiation to completion, such that people are guided by different concerns at the initial stage versus the advanced stage of goal pursuit. Accordingly, offering multiple means or setting different levels of goals will drive motivation in drastically different ways depending on the stage people are in and, thus, their dominant concerns.

The temporally dynamic goal pursuit model critically expands our understanding of goal systems in three ways. First, it adds a temporal dimension by identifying when using multiple means or setting multiple levels of goals would be beneficial versus detrimental for motivation. Second, by capturing the shift in people’s concerns across different stages of goal pursuit, this model provides answers to the question of why different aspects of a goal system would matter at different time points, further enhancing the predictability of the impact of each component in goal systems (e.g., means, subgoal). Third, by examining goal pursuit as a longitudinal and dynamic process that spans from initiation to completion, this model offers a novel solution to sustaining motivated behaviors. Individuals and organizations need to adapt the means they offer, the goal structure, and the focus of the pursuit as people advance on a goal.

I first review classic motivation theories to highlight two key drivers of motivation—expectancy and value. I also discuss how adopting goal systems theory helps to inform people’s assessments of these two drivers. Then, I introduce the temporally dynamic goal pursuit model to illustrate when each driver will dominate a goal pursuit journey. Based on this model, I then discuss three lines of work that examine when (1) the number of means, (2) the flexibility of means, and (3) a subgoal structure will be motivating versus demotivating over different stages of a goal pursuit. Finally, I discuss how other streams of motivation research interact with this temporally dynamic goal pursuit model to inform future research.

### Goal Systems, Expectancy, and Value

Goals, as cognitive representations, are interconnected with their respective subgoals and attainment means (Bargh, 1990]]; Bargh & Gollwitzer, 1994]]; Kruglanski, 1996]]; Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; Shah & Kruglanski, 2003]]; see Chapter 1]]). For instance, a health goal can be associated with sequential, smaller subgoals such as losing 3 pounds of weight per week; and these subgoals are associated with means that can help one achieve them, such as cutting calories and exercising regularly. During the process of working toward a health goal, individuals have many options: One can choose to focus on the overall goal of health or the subgoal of losing 3 pounds of weight. One can also choose to use a single means to persist through this journey (e.g., focusing on cutting calories for months) or switch between multiple means of attainment (cutting calories for 2 weeks and then exercising regularly for another 2 weeks).

To answer the question of how offering multiple means or setting different levels of goals will drive people’s motivation throughout a goal pursuit journey, we first need to discuss what drives motivation: expectancy and value.

#### Expectancy and Value Drive Motivation

Prior literature has explored many variables that can drive people’s motivation to achieve a goal. One critical insight is that commitment is essential; the more committed one is to one’s goal, the more effort and resources one will be willing to invest into achieving the goal and the more resilient one will be when encountering obstacles (e.g., Bargh & Chartrand, 1999]]; Baumeister et al., 1998]]; Koo & Fishbach, 2008]]).

Commitment is largely determined by two factors—the value of the goal and the expectancy of goal attainment (Gollwitzer & Oettingen, 2012]]; Latham & Locke, 2006]]; Locke & Latham, [^1990], [^2019]; Locke et al., 1988]]). While valence (or value) is often identified as a key determinant of one’s ongoing commitment to a goal (Dossett et al., 1979]]; Mento et al., 1980]]; Oldham, 1975]]), the expected probability of obtaining the goal is also consistently shown to relate to one’s commitment during goal pursuit (Dachler & Mobley, 1973]]; Kolb & Boyatzis, 1970]]; Locke et al., 1984]]). This positive relationship between value, expectancy, and the resulting commitment has been comprehensively discussed in classic models that depict goal pursuit processes (e.g., Atkinson, 1957]]; Vroom, 1964]]). In practice, it has also been shown that high-level yet achievable goals consistently lead to greater effort, focus, and persistence than moderate or easy goals across a wide range of tasks and subjects, including loggers, engineers, scientists, entrepreneurs, professors, and students (Latham & Locke, 2006]]; Locke & Latham, 1990]]).

Other terms that have been used to conceptualize value and expectancy are _desirability_ and _feasibility_. Gollwitzer and Moskowitz (1996)]], for instance, argued that goal-directed behaviors are initiated based on the desirability and feasibility of the goal, in relation to the desirability and feasibility of other competing goals. Hence, while one can potentially set different performance goals at work (e.g., achieving five sales, 10 sales, or 15 sales in a week), the goal that provides both high desirability and high feasibility (e.g., achieving 10 sales in a week) will lead to the highest level of commitment. Oettingen et al. (2004)]] similarly argued that perceived feasibility and desirability affect not only the selection of a goal but also the intensity of goal-striving, such that the higher the feasibility and desirability beliefs, the more intensely people work toward a goal. In contrast, people give up on goals that turn out to be much harder to achieve than originally anticipated (i.e., when feasibility beliefs need to be corrected downward) or much less attractive than originally thought (i.e., when desirability beliefs are corrected downward).

How do people assess the expectancy and value of their goals? Such assessments can be done based on internal information defined by one’s goal systems as well as external information such as the feedback one receives and the success or failure of one’s peers in similar situations. This is a cyclical process in which external information feeds into the internal goal structure and allows updates to occur, and the internal goal structure guides one’s perception of, attention to, and memory of external information. Goal systems hence play a critical role in this process; when a new element (e.g., a new means of achieving the goal) is introduced, it is incorporated into one’s goal systems, which can meaningfully alter one’s evaluation of expectancy and the value of the goal, subsequently determining one’s commitment to work toward it. In the following section, I discuss how goal systems inform the evaluations of expectancy and value, respectively.

#### Goal Systems Inform Expectancy

The expectancy assessment evaluates our likelihood of attaining the goal (Oettingen, 1996]]), which could include assessing whether the focal action will lead to the desired outcome (i.e., outcome expectation [Bandura, 1997]]; Wood & Bandura, 1989]]], instrumentality belief [Vroom, 1964]]]) and assessing our own abilities to achieve the outcome (self-efficacy belief [Bandura, [^1986], [^1988]; Wood & Bandura, 1989]]]).

Goal systems theory informs expectancy evaluations in several ways. First, when a means is uniquely and strongly associated with a goal, the transfer nature of goal systems suggests that an easy-to-execute (vs. hard-to-execute) means will make the goal seem more attainable. In this case, cutting only 50 (vs. 300) calories per day would seem more feasible, rendering the goal of improving health more feasible as well. Second, when multiple means are associated with a goal (i.e., an equifinality structure; see Chapter 1]]), it can give the impression that individuals have multiple ways to achieve the goal, such that failing to use one means does not prevent them from eventually attaining the goal. In this case, having multiple means can render a positive overall evaluation of the attainability of the associated goal. For instance, knowing that they can lose weight by cutting calories and by exercising allows individuals to continue pursuing the health goal even after they have failed to follow through on a diet; having only one means of dieting would mean that they have to give up on the goal altogether after failing to use that specific means. Third, and relatedly, having multiple means also allows people to alternate and switch between them as the context changes, offering greater flexibility and further enhancing the belief that the goal is indeed attainable (see Chapter 9]] for an in-depth discussion on means shift). Fourth, because a big overall goal can be broken into smaller subgoals, focusing on a subgoal should increase the assessment of expectancy, compared to focusing on the overall goal, which may be quite far away and feel daunting.

#### Goal Systems Inform Value

The value assessment evaluates whether pursuing a goal will indeed bring value that is aligned with our fundamental needs (Kenrick et al., 2010]]; Kruglanski et al., 2013; Tay & Diener, 2011]]). As with the expectancy evaluation, goal systems theory informs in several ways how we assess the value of achieving a goal.

First, when a means is uniquely and strongly associated with a goal, the transfer nature of goal systems suggests that a highly valued goal would make the means seem more valuable. If one values a learning goal, the courses that provide relevant content would seem similarly valuable. Second, and interestingly, when multiple means are associated with a goal (i.e., an equifinality structure; Chapter 1]]), each means seems less valuable and instrumental because forgoing one means does not necessarily affect the person’s pursuit and attainment of the overall goal. Having multiple means, while ensuring people’s commitment to the goal, can dampen the perceived value of each specific means. For instance, when people know that they can lose weight by cutting calories and by exercising, both means would seem less valuable and less instrumental, compared to believing that they can lose weight only through dieting; in the latter case, people are more likely to strictly adhere to their diet as there seems to be no substitute for dieting, making it a highly valuable and instrumental means.

Third, people can also line up multiple means to create one sequence of means (e.g., dieting for 1 week and then exercising for 1 week); this fixed structure can remove the perceived substitutability across means, which may help to ensure the perceived instrumentality of these means as a package. Prior research offers ample support for the notion that options and flexibility in goal pursuit can result in decreased performance. For example, research on implementation intentions (Gollwitzer & Brandstätter, 1997]]) is built on the thesis that a single situation–action association facilitates goal pursuit because the presence of multiple means (“opportunities to act”) may inhibit the performance of goal-congruent behaviors. Relatively inflexible stimuli–action associations are thus facilitative of goal pursuit because these associations allow individuals to capture the right moment to act and prevent factors that may potentially derail goal pursuit, such as excessive deliberation and second thoughts.

Fourth, following the logic discussed earlier, since subgoals are lower-level, smaller goals compared to the overall goal, focusing on subgoals should lead to a lower assessment of value, making the pursuit seem less valuable compared to focusing on the larger overall goal; for instance, sales teams will see greater value when focusing on their large, annual goal (which leads to a large bonus and promotion) compared to their trivial weekly goal.

### A Temporally Dynamic Model of Goal Pursuit

So far, I have established that expectancy and value evaluations drive motivation and that goal systems critically inform both assessments. The next question I ask is how these assessments work together to drive people’s motivation throughout a goal pursuit journey.

A goal pursuit journey is long and dynamic as it consists of multiple phases. For example, consider the goal of completing a Business 101 course: One has to sign up for the course, learn the basic constructs over the first set of lectures, pass the midterm exam, learn how to apply these constructs over the second set of lectures, work with teammates to complete the assignments, and pass the final exam. Prior research has documented that during this process individuals actively monitor their progress (Carver & Scheier, 1998]]) and adjust their efforts along the way (Kivetz et al., 2006]]; Nunes & Drèze, 2006). However, what these findings did not address is how individuals’ current progress on a goal changes not only the amount of effort they invest but also the source of their motivation.

The key premise of the temporally dynamic goal pursuit model is that people’s primary concerns about the goal will change as they make progress from the early stage to the advanced stage of the journey. In the early stage of a goal pursuit, people face many uncertainties, particularly whether or not they can successfully attain their goal. Individuals who have just started pursuing a health goal, for instance, will likely question whether they can shed enough pounds to reach their ideal weight, and thus may be hesitant to invest effort until they feel sure about the goal’s attainability; an attractive yet unattainable weight-loss goal is unlikely to elicit motivation. Since initiating the pursuit of a goal reflects one’s conscious decision to commit to the goal with the expectation of eventual attainment, whether the goal is perceived to be attainable is crucial for people in this early stage of the pursuit. Therefore, I posit that people actively seek information to confirm the attainability of the goal in this early stage and that their motivation largely depends on their assessment of the goal’s attainability (Huang & Zhang, 2011]]). A goal system that signals higher attainability, therefore, should induce greater motivation early on (Bandura, 1982]]; Lewin, 1951]]; Mischel et al., 1996]]; Pervin, 1989]]).

Importantly, people’s concern over the goal’s attainability is unlikely to dominate throughout the journey. As people accumulate significant progress and approach the endpoint, they become relatively certain that they can indeed attain the goal (Liberman & Förster, 2008]]; Wood & Bandura, 1989]]). For example, compared with people who have just begun the pursuit of a health goal, those who have already shed 20 pounds out of their 30-pound weight-loss goal will be more confident that they will reach their ideal weight. Accordingly, people at these advanced stages of goal pursuit become less concerned about expectancy and no longer derive motivation from this assessment (Zhang & Huang, 2010]]).

As the driving role of expectancy subsides, the role of value becomes important. A large body of research on the goal gradient theory and the “goal looms larger” effect has observed that people’s motivation increases as they move closer to the endpoint—a point at which the goal’s value can be fully enjoyed or realized (Hull, 1932]]; Liberman & Förster, 2008]]). It follows that people who have arrived at the advanced stage of goal pursuit will be less concerned about whether they can attain the goal and will be more concerned about when they will get to enjoy the value that the goal affords (Huang & Zhang, 2011]]). The key driver at this stage, therefore, is the race to the end, reducing the remaining discrepancy to reach and enjoy the final reward (Koo & Fishbach, 2008]]; Fishbach et al., 2009]]).

Because of this switch from questioning attainability in the early stage to focusing on closing the remaining gap to obtain value in the advanced stage, the core elements of goal systems—the number of means, the flexibility of means, and subgoals—will drive motivation differently depending on the stage people are in and their focal concern. Below, I discuss three lines of research findings that provide evidence for this proposition.

### From Multiple Means to a Single Means

The first line of empirical work pertains to the number of means. Conventional wisdom advocates for offering options—the more options, the better. Fundraising organizations arrange multiple channels through which people can donate, in the hope that the availability of multiple means will encourage greater contribution. As a frequent traveler, I am constantly bombarded by airlines’ emails offering hundreds of means that will help me earn points toward the mileage goal, such as flying with the airline, renting cars from partner companies, shopping at a designated grocery chain, and buying gift cards.

If people indeed switch their focus from worrying about a goal’s attainability to wanting to enjoy this goal’s value as they move from the initial stage to the advanced stage of goal pursuit, the number of means that will best motivate effort in each stage should vary accordingly.

#### Temporal Dynamics of the Number of Means

Specifically, when people are in the initial stage of goal pursuit and focus primarily on whether the goal is attainable, the presence of multiple complementary means, compared with having only a single means, should make the goal seem more easily attainable and result in greater motivation. This is because a goal that can be attained through multiple complementary means suggests higher flexibility in the pursuit, allowing people to maximize the effectiveness of their effort and increase their likelihood of eventually succeeding (see also Chapter 7]] on the variety of means). For example, a salesperson would be more likely to accept a challenging sales goal at the beginning of the year if it could be reached by combining sales from multiple channels since that offers a greater chance of final attainment.

However, when people have made substantial progress on a goal and its attainability is relatively secured, they focus more on when they can finally attain the goal and enjoy its value. Compared with multiple means, a single means provides a straightforward roadmap for people to “race to the end,” ensuring a high instrumentality of this means and thus high motivation to follow through with this means. Conversely, focusing on multiple means at this advanced stage would be detrimental because the perceived instrumentality of each means is diluted, hurting the value assessment that critically drives motivation at this advanced stage. Using the same salesperson example, as this worker approaches the end of the annual sales goal and the bonus is in sight, focusing on making sales through one channel should lead to greater effort exertion than still trying to make sales through multiple channels would.

One central proposal in my theorizing is that people interpret the contexts—where they are on the goal and the means that are available—and make inferences to address their primary concerns at the moment. The distinctive concerns that characterize different stages of goal pursuit, therefore, determine the impact of the number of attainment means on motivation.

#### A Blood Donation Drive in Texas

To test this proposal, in one of our studies, we collaborated with a local blood bank to organize a blood donation drive on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. We approached hundreds of individuals for the blood donation drive, including undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, and staff members. We distributed four versions of a campaign letter. All four letters first described how blood collected by the blood bank saved the life of a local girl. The letters then explained the mission of the organization and described a current blood donation drive on campus. People read either that we were about to launch this blood donation drive and aimed to collect 100 pints of blood (early-stage conditions) or that we had been running the campaign for a while and had collected 80 pints of blood (advanced-stage conditions).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-013-colour.gif)

We altered the time of the donation drive so that in the single-means conditions, the letter stated that the drive would be conducted on November 16, for “ONE DAY ONLY, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.” In the multiple-means conditions, the letter stated that the drive would also be held on November 16 but during three different shifts: Shift A from 9 a.m. to 12 noon, Shift B from 12 noon to 2 p.m., and Shift C from 2 to 5 p.m. Although the actual duration of the drive was exactly the same, people in the multiple-means conditions were led to believe that there were multiple opportunities (i.e., three separate time slots) for them to donate, whereas those in the single-means conditions believed that there was only one means (i.e., 1 day) to do so.

We found that the proportion of people who signed up to donate blood varied depending on the stage of the campaign and the number of means we highlighted. Among the people who thought we had yet to kick off this campaign, 62.0% signed up to donate blood when there were three separate shifts, compared to 49.6% who signed up to donate blood when the campaign was described as being 1 day only. In contrast, when the campaign had made substantial progress and needed only 20 pints of blood to finish, the opposite happened—61.0% signed up to donate when the drive was 1 day only, whereas 45.6% signed up to donate when there were three separate shifts (see Figure 5.1]]).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-014.gif)

Figure 5.1 Offering multiple time slots motivated more signups in the initial stage of the drive; offering a single time slot motivated more signups in the advanced stage of the drive (Huang & Zhang, 2013]]).

We also invited these potential donors to take contact cards to distribute to their friends and colleagues to promote the drive. We observed the same pattern regarding the word-of-mouth promotion for the drive (see Figure 5.2]]).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-015.gif)

Figure 5.2 Offering multiple time slots motivated more word-of-mouth in the initial stage of the drive; offering a single time slot motivated more word-of-mouth in the advanced stage of the drive (Huang & Zhang, 2013]]).

#### The Driving Role of Goal Attainability

So far, I have discussed field data that supported the notion that having multiple means to reach a goal can be motivating in the early stage but demotivating when people have reached the advanced stage of a goal pursuit journey. In another study, we explored whether this change in the way multiple means affect motivation across goal stages indeed occurs because people’s core concerns have evolved. The temporally dynamic goal pursuit model posits that people will first question a goal’s attainability, and only when this uncertainty is alleviated will they start to focus on the goal’s value (and thus on the instrumentality of a given means). If so, assuring people of the goal’s attainability early on may make this switch occur earlier—that is, people would be motivated by a single means’ high instrumentality/value even in the early stage. Conversely, if the goal’s attainability is put into question in the advanced stage of goal pursuit, people will switch back to address this uncertainty (as there can be no value if a goal is not even attainable); this would make them more sensitive to cues that suggest that a goal is indeed attainable, such as knowing that they still have multiple means to pursue it.

#### A Movie-Rating Task

We created a movie-rating task to test these possibilities. We invited undergraduate students to be our “movie critics.” All critics completed a long survey that included demographic and general preference questions, and they also rated a series of stimuli (e.g., music samples and movie trailers) to build their profile. Upon finishing, for those in the initial-stage conditions, we thanked them for building the profile; they could start rating movie stimuli to earn points, and 300 points would get them a premiere ticket. For those in the advanced-stage conditions, we thanked them for building their profile and informed them that we would give them 200 points to show our appreciation; therefore, these participants needed only an additional 100 points to reach 300 points for the premiere ticket.

To directly manipulate certainty, we provided additional information for half of the critics. We told half of the critics in the initial-stage conditions that, on the basis of our past experiences, most of the critics eventually reached 300 points for premiere tickets; in contrast, we told half of the critics in the advanced-stage conditions that, on the basis of our past experiences, only a few critics eventually reached 300 points for the premiere tickets, even though many of them could get close. This design allowed us to examine what naturally occurred when people were starting the task versus when people were approaching the endpoint (i.e., natural conditions), as well as what happened when goal attainability was externally confirmed early on or was made uncertain late in the pursuit (i.e., the attainability intervened conditions).

Similar to the blood donation drive, we then manipulated the number of means by telling the critics that they would have access either to one rating site for all movies (single means) or to three different sites for different movie categories (multiple means). All movie critics would have 3 days to log into the site(s) to watch clips and provide their ratings.

Our main interest was the total number of times that the movie critics logged into the rating site(s) during the 3-day period. Let’s first look at the critics who were not provided with direct information on goal attainability (i.e., the natural conditions). We again found that among the critics who had yet to start making progress, the belief that they could earn points at three different websites led to more frequent visits; knowing that there was only one site through which they could earn points was demotivating. In contrast, among the critics who have earned 200 points and thus were getting close to the goal, we again found that those who believed that they could earn points at a single site logged in more frequently, compared to those who had three sites still open and available.

What happened when we provided additional information on the goal’s attainability (the attainability intervened conditions)? We found that as long as goal attainability remained uncertain, having multiple (vs. a single) means was more motivating, even when the movie critics have earned 200 points already; similarly, as long as people were relatively certain about their chances of attaining the goal, having a single (vs. multiple) means was more motivating, even in the beginning of the goal pursuit journey. Hence, goal stage was a proxy for when people’s key concerns about the task shift; at its core, it is the perception that a goal is attainable that makes an individual start focusing on the goal’s value and become more motivated by the high instrumentality that a single means (vs. multiple means) affords.

### From a Flexible Sequence to a Fixed Sequence of Means

A similar logic can apply to how the means are arranged. In the marketing context, merchants often offer reward programs that require customers to take multiple actions, and these actions may be arranged in a specific sequence or a flexible sequence. For instance, an online wine store (yesmywine.com) offers its customers a “country medal” if they purchase a bottle of wine from a given country in a specific month and provides a bonus for collecting 12 country medals following a specified sequence (e.g., January—France, February—Chile, March—Italy) over the course of 1 year. Other competing stores may offer greater flexibility, such that customers can collect wines from 12 countries in any month, as long as they can collect all 12 countries by the end of the year.

When viewed from afar, providing flexibility might seem better. This allows people to arrange the sequence of actions in any way they wish, which should make goal attainment seem more likely. The requirement of completing all necessary actions in a fixed sequence imposes restrictions, making it more difficult. However, while the absence of a predetermined order provides flexibility, it requires people to make choices on their next steps when they finish each goal-directed action. This is not a trivial task. Making choices about the next steps during a goal pursuit requires people to temporarily take their mind off the active performance of goal-related actions and evaluate which option can better help them attain the goal. The repeated choices for the next steps require people to shift back and forth between different mindsets, and these transitions disrupt the continuity of the pursuit and can be a rather taxing experience (Hamilton et al., 2011]]). A fixed sequence, while restricting the options, solves this problem by eliminating the need for repeated choices during an active goal pursuit. A fixed sequence thus creates an uninterrupted flow and ensures that people can remain in an implemental mindset and execute the goal-directed actions more swiftly and efficiently (Gollwitzer, 1999]]). That is, a fixed sequence of actions provides a straightforward roadmap for completion and ensures high instrumentality to the goal.

#### A Loyalty Program at a Yogurt Shop

In one of our studies, we launched a customer loyalty program in collaboration with a yogurt shop to capture this proposed benefit of imposing a fixed sequence (vs. a flexible sequence). The shop’s customers were mainly business professionals and students in Shanghai, China. The loyalty program required the purchase of six full-priced yogurts to earn a coupon that could be redeemed for two free yogurts. All loyalty cards required the purchase of each of the store’s six most popular flavors (apple, banana, orange, mango, grape, and strawberry), but the cards differed in whether the six purchases needed to be made in a predetermined sequence. For the flexible-sequence cards, there was no requirement on purchasing sequence; for the fixed-sequence cards, the program required that the purchases be made following a sequence specified on the card (e.g., banana →apple →strawberry →orange →mango →grape; order counterbalanced).

We also manipulated goal adoption (early stage) and completion (advanced stage). In the goal-adoption conditions, we informed customers who received the card that they would need to come back on a different day to activate it before they could start accumulating stamps. In the goal-completion conditions, customers received an “activated” card and were told that they could accumulate stamps beginning with their next visit to the store.

We distributed 800 cards in total. We found that when customers needed to return to activate the card (i.e., to begin the pursuit of the goal), customers who received the flexible-sequence cards were more likely to return, compared to customers who received the fixed-sequence card. The flexible-sequence cards thus were more motivating for initiating goal pursuit. Interestingly, the completion rate among customers who received an activated card (i.e., advanced stage) showed the opposite pattern: More customers who received the fixed-sequence card completed all the necessary purchases, compared to customers who received the flexible-sequence card. The fixed-sequence cards, therefore, were more facilitative for helping customers complete the goal pursuit (see Figure 5.3]]).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-016.gif)

Figure 5.3 To initiate the loyalty card, a flexible sequence was more motivating; to complete the loyalty card, a fixed sequence was more motivating (Jin et al., 2013]]).

It is also important to note that customers in the goal-adoption conditions who chose to initiate the goal showed the same completion patterns as those who were randomly assigned to the goal-completion conditions: More customers who initiated the fixed-sequence card completed all purchases, compared to those who initiated the flexible-sequence card. Furthermore, for the customers who received the fixed-sequence card, the time between their visits decreased by 1.49 days with each additional purchased yogurt; in contrast, for the customers who received the flexible-sequence card, the time between visits did not decrease with each additional purchased yogurt. Hence, imposing a fixed sequence allows people to “race to the end” to enjoy the goal’s value, whereas having flexibility encourages goal adoption early on as it makes the goal seem easier to attain.

### From Subgoals to the Overall Goal

So far I have discussed two lines of empirical work that examine the temporal dynamics of means—the number of means and the sequence of means (see Chapter 7]] for the variety among means). The third line of work pertains to the temporal dynamics of subgoals. Subgoals are pre-established smaller steps toward the achievement of an overarching goal (Borrelli & Mermelstein, 1994]]; Heath et al., 1999]]; Lewin, 1936]]). Because subgoals are successive approximations toward an overall goal (Murray, 1938]]), they are not ends in themselves. Instead, they exist only because of primary goals (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]).

On the conceptual level, goals function as reference points (Heath et al., 1999]]) and motivate people by creating a negative discrepancy between a person’s desired state and their current state. What distinguishes goals with an elaborated subgoal structure from those without subgoals is that the latter focuses people on a single reference point, whereas the former presents two (or more) distinct and simultaneous reference points. For example, an employee hoping to complete 3000 sales calls might have only this number in mind as the reference point. However, if the employee divides the goal into consecutive 100-call subgoals, they might simultaneously hold multiple numbers—100, 200, 300 . . . 3000—in mind, with both the most proximal subgoal and the ultimate overall goal as relevant reference points (Heath et al., 1999]]).

#### Benefits, Costs, and Temporal Dynamics of Subgoals

The use of subgoals is associated with many benefits. Subgoals are easier and quicker to accomplish than the overall goal, reducing the difficulty and complexity of the pursuit and providing a greater sense of progress (Brunstein, 1993]]; Locke & Latham, 1990]]; Newell & Simon, 1972]]; Pervin, 1989]]; Soman & Shi, 2003]]). Hence, the use of subgoals can help solve the “starting problem” that arises when one confronts a difficult goal (Heath et al., 1999]]). In the context of debt settlement, Gal and McShane (2012)]] found that as individuals paid off more debt accounts (i.e., the more financial subgoals they accomplished), their subsequent effort in eliminating their overall debt increased.

On the other hand, there are also costs associated with setting and accomplishing subgoals. Because subgoals represent additional intermediate levels that individuals must work toward, they can lead to motivational distraction and interfere with the ultimate goal (Heath et al., 1999]]; Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; Newell & Simon, 1972]]). Subgoals often replace the overarching goal as the center of reference (Heath et al., 1999]]), and the sense of accomplishment from completing individual subgoals can cause complacency, leading to lower motivation to continue working on the overall goal. For instance, Fishbach et al. (2006)]] showed that when people considered their success on a subgoal, they would view additional actions toward achieving the superordinate goal as substitutes and thus were less likely to pursue these actions.

The potential effect of a subgoal structure is particularly intriguing when viewed in the context of the temporally dynamic goal pursuit model because a subgoal structure holds answers to both concerns—helping to address the question of whether the goal is attainable as well as whether it is worth pursuing.

Specifically, because subgoals represent smaller and more manageable steps, focusing on these incremental steps should lead to the perception that the pursuit is easier and the goal seems more attainable (Brunstein, 1993]]; Soman & Shi, 2003]]). This perception can be particularly useful when individuals feel doubtful about the goal’s attainability, such as when they start working on the goal and have made little progress. For example, for a person who has recently begun to repay a $40,000 student loan, a focus on the ultimate goal may seem intimidating. By contrast, a set of more budget-friendly subgoals (e.g., setting aside $400 in the next month) seems more manageable and makes the overall target seem less out of reach, increasing people’s likelihood of saving money.

However, because subgoals represent smaller steps, they are much less valuable than the overall goal. Accordingly, actions and means associated with a subgoal seem less valuable and less instrumental than those associated with the overall goal. Once people have accumulated sufficient progress and stop questioning the goal’s attainability and start focusing instead on the value of their actions, a subgoal structure thus can be demotivating. When the debt-paying student in the previous example has passed the $35,000 mark, the goal of $40,000 seems within reasonable reach, and the concern about attainability dwindles. At this advanced stage, cooking at home in order to reach the next subgoal of $400 in savings would not seem as valuable as cooking at home in order to reach the ultimate goal of becoming debt-free.

#### A Work-for-Pay Study

We attempted to capture the predictions above in one of our lab studies in which undergraduate students undertook a paid transcription job. Participants transcribed paragraphs of text in a foreign language from JPEG files to a word processing program on a computer. They earned points during the task that determined their pay, and we structured the points in two different ways. In the overall goal condition, participants needed to collect 100 points to complete the job; and we presented a single progress bar at the top of the page. By contrast, participants in the subgoal condition were informed that the job consisted of five consecutive sections (1–5) and that they needed to earn 20 points in each section; five horizontal bars running parallel to each other were shown on the screen.

We standardized how participants progressed, and we displayed the progress bar when they reached either 30% (initial stage) or 70% (advanced stage) of the task. Depending on the goal structure they were assigned, the progress bars looked like those shown in Figure 5.4]].

Figure 5.4 Progress bar for overall goal versus subgoal (Huang et al., 2017]]).

We found that when participants completed 30% of the job and saw the initial-stage progress bars, those who pursued a series of subgoals transcribed more words compared to those who pursued an overall goal. This suggested that the subgoal structure was more motivating in the early stage. We observed the opposite pattern when participants completed 70% of the job: Those who pursued an overall goal transcribed more words compared to those who pursued subgoals. Hence, when the participants focused on the overall goal, their motivation was low early in the pursuit but increased significantly as they approached the end of the task. In contrast, when participants used a subgoal structure, although they were highly motivated at the beginning of the task, they showed lower motivation as they approached the end (see Figure 5.5]]).

Figure 5.5 Focusing on subgoals led to greater performance in the early stage of the task; focusing on the overall goal led to greater performance in the advanced stage of the task (Huang et al., 2017]]).

In this study, we also directly measured participants’ perceptions of the attainability of the goal and the value of their actions. We found that when participants had completed only 30% of the task, those in the subgoal condition believed that they were more likely to attain the goal than those in the overall goal condition; such difference did not occur when participants reached 70% of the job, suggesting that the goal’s attainability was no longer a key concern at this stage. In contrast, there was no difference in the perceived value of actions when participants had completed only 30% of the task; however, after the participants had completed 70% of the job, those pursuing an overall goal perceived their actions to be much more valuable than those still pursuing a series of subgoals. Bias-corrected mediation analyses verified that when the participants had completed only 30% of the job, the perceived goal attainability was the dominant driver for how goal structure affected their effort; when participants had reached 70% progress, the perceived value of actions became the dominant driver of motivation.

#### A Hybrid Goal Structure at a Crowdsourcing Company

Based on the temporally dynamic goal pursuit model, the most optimal goal structure would be one that shifts from highlighting a subgoal in the early stage to highlighting instead the overall goal in the advanced stage. We tested this “hybrid structure” in the field by collaborating with a crowdsourcing company in China. Together, we launched an 8-day field experiment with 200 registered part-time workers at this company. These workers had to collect sales information on books at different bookstores across town by taking pictures and uploading them through the crowdsourcing company’s mobile app.

We sent daily reminders and feedback to workers through their smartphones. In the overall goal condition, the reminders emphasized that the workers needed to earn a total of 80 work points by the end of 8 days to receive the compensation. We again illustrated the goal with a long progress bar anchored by 80 points on the right end. In the subgoal condition, the reminders encouraged the workers to divide the 80 points into eight smaller subgoals of earning 10 points each day. We illustrated eight short progress bars, each anchored by 10 points on the right end. In the hybrid condition, we presented subgoals during the first 4 days but presented the overall goal during the latter 4 days; the workers in this condition viewed their current number of points relative to their current subgoal from Days 1 to 4 and received feedback relative to their overall goal from Days 5 to 8.

We found that at the end of the 8-day period, the workers in the overall goal condition uploaded 1268 books in total, while those in the subgoal condition uploaded 1392 books. The workers in the hybrid condition uploaded 1906 books, generating the highest total performance. Figure 5.6]] illustrates their day-to-day performance: For workers who focused on the overall goal, their motivation fit a quadratic function such that their performance quickly decreased after the first day, remained low during Days 2 to 5, and increased on Day 6. In contrast, for workers who focused on subgoals, their motivation fit a negative linear function such that they began the work highly motivated and then gradually reduced their effort as they inched forward in the task. The motivation of workers in the hybrid condition also fit a quadratic function: During Days 1 to 4, these workers’ motivation was higher than that of the workers in the overall goal condition and was comparable to that of the workers in the subgoal condition. Importantly, workers in the hybrid condition remained highly motivated during the latter half of the task (Days 5 to 8), which explained the highest total performance with this goal structure.

Figure 5.6 Focusing on subgoals led to greater performance from Days 1 to 4; focusing on the overall goal led to greater performance from Days 5 to 8; a hybrid goal structure led to the highest performance throughout the job (Huang et al., 2017]]).

Overall, a subgoal structure can increase perceived goal attainability but also decrease the perceived value of one’s actions. Hence, the effect of a subgoal structure on motivation critically changes from the early stage to the advanced stage as the key driver of people’s motivation shifts from attainability to value. Leveraging the goal structure dynamically to allow the most optimal inference to be drawn hence goes a long way toward ensuring a high level of motivation throughout a goal pursuit journey.

### Final Remarks and Remaining Questions

In this chapter, I introduce a temporally dynamic goal pursuit model and discuss how this model expands goal systems theory by illustrating how each component in a goal system—the number of means, the sequence of means, and a structure of subgoals—can either motivate or demotivate effort across different stages of a goal pursuit. I have discussed empirical evidence collected from students, faculty, staff members, actual customers, and employees in the United States and in China to support this theory. All of these lab and field experiments point to the importance of dynamically adjusting the goal system based on the stage of the pursuit so that the goal system can better address people’s core concern in a specific stage.

#### When Choice Complicates Things

A reoccurring theme in this chapter is that choice is not always motivating. The dilemma of having too many options hence emerges not only in one-shot decision-making contexts (Iyengar & Lepper, 2000]]; Shafir et al., 1993]]; Tversky & Shafir, 1992]]) but also in the context of goal pursuit, in which continuous effort exertion is needed. In working toward a goal, having choices can be productive when people are concerned about attainability, but it becomes counterproductive when people focus on racing to the end and are driven instead by high instrumentality. Echoing the studies I discussed in this chapter, Etkin and Ratner (2012; see also Chapter 7]]) also found that even when we keep the number of means constant, offering high variety across these means can be motivating when the progress on a goal is low, whereas having low variety across these means is more motivating when the progress on a goal is already high.

On a more general level, the findings in this chapter suggest a distinction between having the liberty of choice and the actual act of making a choice. The presence of options affords individuals the liberty of switching to a more efficient means when the going gets tough, and it offers important assurance of goal attainment. But the actual exercising of this option may be disruptive and burdensome, particularly when people need to advance quickly and focus on the value/instrumentality aspect of the pursuit. In this sense, the benefits of choice are best enjoyed when choice options are not yet fully exercised. This notion is consistent with the distinction between experiential and instrumental choices (Choi & Fishbach, 2011]]), which separates choices that one has to make from those one does not have to make. In a similar vein, restrictions in goal pursuit can at times be beneficial. By taking away options in late stages of a pursuit, people become more motivated because the restrictions result in a more straightforward action plan to help them advance and ensure a high instrumentality between the action and the goal.

#### Rethinking Goal Value

Another interesting aspect to consider is the construct of goal value. Existing theories suggest that people are motivated by the value of and, thus, their commitment to the ultimate goal (Liberman & Förster, 2008]]; Shah et al., 1998]]). The findings in this chapter support this notion that greater goal value motivates greater effort exertion, but the findings also aid in a more precise understanding: that individuals’ perceived value of their present actions may have a more direct influence on motivation than the value of the overall goal does. That is, it is possible that individuals will experience different levels of motivation even when the end goal remains unchanged, such as when subgoals are introduced or when an action is framed as a single means versus one of multiple options (e.g., donating blood during one of three available time slots).

This separation between action value and the value of the overall goal echoes Higgins’ (2006)]] work on value and engagement. His work suggests that value is not solely an experience of pleasure or pain. Value involves an experience of the intensity of a motivational force, which could come from sources that are independent of the value of the final goal, such as regulatory fit and the use of proper means in the pursuit (Higgins, [^2000], [^2006]). Accordingly, when subgoals are the focus, people assess the value of their goal-directed action based on this intermediate structure. Depending on how a subgoal relates to the overall goal, the same action can be experienced differently, adding to the notion that there is value in how goals are pursued independent of the value of the ultimate outcome. Similarly, when a means is framed as the only way forward (vs. being presented as one among multiple options), it changes people’s assessment of instrumentality and thus how they experience the value of their goal-directed action.

#### When Does Goal Attainability Kick In?

Another interesting question is whether people switch fully to a deliberative mindset as soon as they initiate the pursuit of a goal (Gollwitzer et al., 1990]]; Taylor & Gollwitzer, 1995]]). In our studies, we found that flexibility of the goal structure not only enhances motivation when people are deliberating which goal to pursue but also facilitates motivation in actual goal pursuit until people are relatively certain about the goal’s attainability. One implication of this finding is that, in many cases, the switch from a deliberative mindset to an implemental one may not occur immediately when people begin the pursuit. Instead, the transition is a gradual process, and a substantial portion of individuals’ actual goal pursuit may involve a “joint” mindset that is characterized by a combination of both deliberative and implemental cognitive tendencies. Hence, flexibility of a goal system not only encourages goal initiation but also can help to sustain effort in the early stages of an active goal pursuit. Future research in this area will help to deepen the connection between goal systems theory and the temporal models of goal pursuit such as the action-phase model (Gollwitzer et al., 1990]]).

#### Temporal Dynamics in a Social World

People can serve as means to our goals, and the temporal dynamics discussed in this chapter can apply to social dynamics as well. By leveraging a large qualitative data set collected from WeightWatchers (Huang et al., 2015]]), we found that members in the weight-loss program are friendlier to each other in the beginning, sharing helpful tips and seeking social support because doing so helps to alleviate uncertainty about the goal’s attainability. Once they get close to their own fitness goal, members become distant, share less information, and even drop out of the program. In another paper (Huang et al., 2019]]), we found that people can even compete and sabotage others as they enter the advanced stage of shared goal pursuit—they not only want to achieve their individual goals but also want to do better than others, a behavior that suggests a desire to “race to the end” for higher achievement value (e.g., winning against peers). The temporal dynamics of goal pursuit thus manifest in situations where we share goals with others, driving how we leverage, collaborate, and at times compete with each other.

#### Going Beyond Two Goal Stages

While the temporally dynamic goal pursuit model focuses mainly on the two extremes of goal pursuit (the early stage and the advanced stage), the model has further implications for understanding the difference between initiating and maintaining the pursuit of a goal. The initiation of a goal pursuit signals one’s establishment of commitment and changes a person’s behavioral pattern (from not pursuing a goal to pursuing a goal). By comparison, one’s maintenance of goal pursuit signals the extension of this commitment and requires only the continuation of a person’s existing behavioral pattern. On the basis of the temporally dynamic goal pursuit model, people make inferences from goal systems differently because they focus on different aspects of goal pursuit (attainability vs. value). It is therefore possible that people would prefer flexible, multiple means and a subgoal structure when they are initiating a brand new goal because these elements ensure attainability but would conversely prefer the simplicity of a proven means and the focus on the overall goal when maintaining a goal that they already know how to accomplish. For instance, after successfully achieving a goal, a careful reflection on the specific past actions that led to this success can help one maintain goal-aligned behaviors because this thought exercise underscores the instrumentality between past actions and goal success (Huang & Aaker, 2019]]); in this post-success maintenance stage, the question of attainability may not kick in at all. The temporally dynamic goal pursuit model thus can shed light on goal stages beyond the focal journey and explain behaviors such as repeated pursuits and goal updates (e.g., climbing the goal ladder; Koo & Fishbach, 2010]]). This constitutes another fruitful area for future research.

### Conclusion

In sum, temporal dynamics are critical to consider when applying a goal system to motivate effort. Organizations often operate under the assumption that by offering greater flexibility, people will show greater motivation and be more likely to accomplish the goal. Marketers design loyalty programs that allow customers to accumulate points for rewards in multiple ways with a flexible sequence, hoping to encourage more purchases. Schools introduce many milestones to boost students’ learning, and companies set weekly and quarterly goals to boost employees’ performance. This chapter sounds a cautionary bell to these practices; while flexibility of means and a structure of subgoals can indeed be effective when the goal’s attainability is in question, they may be counterproductive when the attainability is no longer a primary concern. Hence, what really constitutes an easier path forward is a path that addresses people’s primary concerns at the moment. As these concerns shift and evolve, so should the goal systems that we design.

Paying for Goals and Means](04_Contents1.xhtml#n0007)

Franklin Shaddy

Goal pursuit necessarily requires resource investment. And these resources often need to be allocated across goals and means. For example, college students need to spend time studying for both prerequisites (invest in means) and core courses (invest in goals). Marathon runners need to exert effort competing in both qualifying races (invest in means) and marquee events (e.g., the New York City Marathon; invest in goals). Shoppers at big-box warehouse clubs need to pay money for both membership (invest in means) and goods (invest in goals).

Moreover, these resources (e.g., time, effort, money) are scarce. In other words, time spent studying in the library is time not spent socializing at parties, effort exerted at the gym is effort not exerted on yardwork, money spent on gifts is money not spent on bills. For no person are these (and other) resources limitless. And so a fundamental question—indeed, perhaps the most fundamental question—for goal systems theory (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]) is how people choose to allocate their scarce resources across goals and means during the course of goal pursuit.

In this chapter, I explain how the architecture of goal systems systematically shapes judgment and decision-making with respect to the allocation of such scarce resources. Specifically, drawing from past work (Shaddy & Fishbach, 2018]]), I explain why people prefer to directly invest resources in goals, rather than indirectly invest resources in means to achieve those goals, even when goal attainment and total resource investment are held constant.

Importantly, this is a theoretical question that yields numerous implications for better understanding consumer behavior, in particular, and motivation, more broadly. And while I primarily focus here on how consumers choose to spend money (to more clearly explicate this account), the conceptual framework I propose should just as readily govern the allocation of any scarce resource across goals and means. In the following sections, I offer a general framework for resource allocation, highlight consequences for consumer behavior, and discuss opportunities for future research.

### The Architecture of Goal Systems

Goal systems are organized hierarchically, such that higher-order goals, which sit atop the hierarchy, are served by subgoals and lower-order means (Figure 6.1]]). Goal pursuit, therefore, often requires people to invest resources vertically, both in various means that facilitate goal attainment as well as in goals directly. For example, when a shopper at a big-box warehouse club (e.g., Costco) spends money on the membership fee, they are investing resources in a means; when they spend on goods purchased at the store, they are investing resources in a goal.

Yet previous research has largely focused on how people choose to allocate resources horizontally, between various means to a given goal or between various goals themselves. Central to these findings is the distinction between _multifinality_—when a single means can help achieve multiple goals—and _equifinality_—when multiple means can help achieve a single goal (Kruglanski et al., 2015]]). And this work has documented a robust preference for instrumental means (i.e., actions that have fewer substitutes). For example, an implication is a _dilution effect_, whereby a means that serves multiple goals (in a multifinal configuration) is viewed as less instrumental (i.e., effective) for any particular goal, compared with a means that serves only that goal (Zhang et al., 2007]]). Such dilution occurs because the cognitive linkages between a means and multiple goals (as opposed to a single goal) reduce the associative strength between it and any particular goal.

Figure 6.1 In the architecture of goal systems, goals sit atop the hierarchy. Thus, whenever individuals are required to invest resources across goals and means, they perceive investing resources in goals as a direct investment in goal attainment (i.e., higher in the goal hierarchy). Investing resources in means, on the other hand, is perceived as an indirect investment (i.e., lower in the goal hierarchy).

Meanwhile, equifinality can yield a number of similarly meaningful implications for motivation. For example, the availability of multiple means for a goal can increase commitment to that goal, by increasing the perceived expectancy of achievement (e.g., if one means fails, another can be recruited in its place; Kruglanski et al., 2011]]). An equifinal configuration can also boost the perceived value of achievement. Put differently, that there are multiple means available for achieving a particular goal suggests it is indeed a goal worth achieving (relative to when only a single means is available; Kruglanski et al., 2014]]).

### Paying for Goals and Means

As noted, however, although past work has largely focused on how people choose to allocate resources horizontally (e.g., between various means and between various goals), resources do nevertheless need to be allocated across goals and means simultaneously. As a result, recent work has begun to probe preferences for the allocation of resources vertically, between the higher- and lower-order elements of goal systems (e.g., superordinate goals vs. subgoals, subgoals vs. means). These findings have suggested that, when given the opportunity, people systematically prefer to shift resources away from means and toward goals, even when doing so would be inconsequential or costly (Shaddy & Fishbach, 2018]]).

For example, suppose a reader is excited about the upcoming release of a new book and plans to spend $30. Two online retailers are accepting preorders: One is offering the book for $25, with $5 in shipping charges, while the other is offering the book for $20, with $10 in shipping charges. Holding all else constant (e.g., shipping speed/reliability, refund policy, the book itself)—and, importantly, given that achieving the goal (i.e., acquiring the book) is equally assured in both cases—would our reader nevertheless prefer one retailer over the other? From a purely economic standpoint, there is no difference between the two. Either way, they must pay $30. But given that people prefer to pay more for goals and less for means (holding all else constant), they actually prefer the former option to the latter (Shaddy & Fishbach, 2018]]).

Unsurprisingly, this preference for shifting resources from means to goals spills over into willingness-to-pay (WTP) for goals and means. For example, in one study, we asked participants to evaluate both an 8-inch chef’s knife and a premium walnut cutting board, and then we manipulated which item was presented as the goal and which item was presented as the means. Specifically, we told participants either (a) that they would need a chef’s knife (the means) in order to use the cutting board (the goal) or (b) that they would need a cutting board (the means) in order to use a chef’s knife (the goal). We then measured WTP for each item. Consistent with our account, participants were willing to pay, on average, $17.17 for the chef’s knife when it was framed as the goal and only $14.04 when the exact same item was framed as a means; conversely, participants were willing to pay, on average, $16.81 for the cutting board when it was framed as the goal and only $14.43 when it was framed as a means.

It is also worth noting that consumers sometimes either pay for goals directly (where 100% of resource investment is shifted to the goal) or pay for means to acquire goals indirectly (where 100% of resource investment is shifted to the means). For example, late-night television infomercials are known to offer free products as long as customers pay for shipping, drink minimums are often required at otherwise free comedy shows, and some museums offer free admission but require visitors to make a donation. Our account thus potentially suggests that forcing people to pay for means (when they would rather pay for goals) might suppress overall WTP in non-normative ways—especially given that means are frequently bundled with goals (e.g., a $25 book is bundled with a $5 shipping cost; Shaddy & Fishbach, 2017]]).

To test this possibility, we conducted a second-price auction for a book signed by a well-known business school professor at the University of Chicago (Richard Thaler). Students either submitted bids for the autographed book (resulting in 100% resource investment in the goal) or submitted bids for a branded tote bag that contained the autographed book (resulting in 100% resource investment in the means). As such, we held constant the goal (e.g., acquiring the autographed book) and manipulated only whether resource investment would be direct or indirect (i.e., payment would be for either the means or the goal). What we found might shock an economist: Bids for the autographed book averaged $23.38, while bids for the tote bag containing the same autographed book averaged $12.18. Notably, the tote bag retailed for $16.98, suggesting that it actually maintained negative utility when framed as a means to a desired end.

### Implications for Resource Investment

The preference to shift resources from means to goals is not limited only to money, of course. Consumers exchange many other resources for goods and services in the marketplace (e.g., time, energy; Shaddy & Shah, 2018]], 2022). For example, in another study, we presented participants with two news articles. For half of the participants, we framed the articles as forming a goal–means dyad, such that the first article represented the means by which readers could achieve the goal of comprehending the second article. For the other half, we framed each article as a separate goal, such that participants aimed to comprehend both. We then measured how long participants spent reading each, finding that the presence of a goal–means relationship between the articles caused participants to spend less time reading the article framed as a means (96 seconds) relative to the article framed as the goal (120 seconds). By contrast, when both articles were framed as separate goals, participants spent less time reading the first (93 seconds) than the second (103 seconds).

Consumers frequently make intertemporal choices as well. And one relevant insight with respect to event timing (Huang, 2022]]; Shaddy, Tu, & Fishbach, 2022]]; Shaddy et al., 2022]]) is that pushing a cost further into the future effectively reduces its magnitude, due to temporal discounting (Frederick et al., 2002]]; Zauberman & Urminsky, 2016]]). As such, resolving intertemporal trade-offs can be thought of as simply another way to shift resource investment (Roberts et al., 2021]]; Fishbach & Shaddy, 2016]]; Shaddy, Fishbach, & Simonson, 2021]]). Therefore, if people prefer to pay more for goals and less for means, they should likewise prefer delaying the cost of a means for as long as possible (more so than the cost of a goal). In a study testing this prediction, we presented participants with two equally priced items (e.g., beach towels and a tote bag), which either maintained a goal–means relationship (e.g., the tote bag served as a means for carrying and using the beach towels) or were ostensibly unrelated. We then described a credit card promotion in which one item could be paid for 1 year later, without interest. Participants were more likely to delay payment of the tote bag when it was construed as a means.

Finally, consumers also often control whether they pay for goals and means, depending on how they use discounts, coupons, and promotional offers (Shaddy & Lee, 2020]]). For example, a $5 retail voucher could be used to reduce the cost of a new book or the cost of shopping. If people are more willing to invest resources in goals, relative to means, they should choose, whenever possible, to reduce costs associated with means. And this is exactly what we found in a study that asked participants to apply tuition waivers, credits, and promotional vouchers to various goals and means. They consistently expressed a stronger desire to eliminate costs associated with means—for example, by applying a tuition waiver to a prerequisite class (a means), rather than a core class (the goal)—thereby shifting a greater proportion of resource investment toward goals (Shaddy & Fishbach, 2018]]).

### Potential Moderators

An implication of this account is that variables that affect the relative importance of goals and means should, in turn, moderate the preference to shift resources from means to goals (Table 6.1]]). For example, _goal proximity_—the closer someone is to achieving a goal—has been shown to increase the value of that focal goal (Kivetz, Urminsky, & Zheng, 2006]]). If the value of a focal goal increases (e.g., due to goal proximity), then the relative importance of an associated means necessarily decreases. So, when a new book is about to be released, the preference to pay $25 for the book (the goal) and $5 for shipping (the means) versus $20 for the book (the goal) and $10 for shipping (the means) should be stronger when the book is going to be released in 1 week relative to 1 year. This is because temporal proximity makes the focal goal more valuable in the former case relative to the latter. As a result, the desire to directly invest resources in goals rather than indirectly invest resources in means to achieve those goals should be heightened.

In the following section, I outline a number of potential moderators, each of which should either attenuate or exacerbate the preference for shifting resources from means to goals. These variables thus characterize meaningful opportunities for future research.

|Scarcity and depletion|To the extent that the availability of mental resources helps people focus on the importance of achieving their goals, cognitive scarcity decreases the preference to shift resources from means to goals (undermining the relative importance of a focal goal).|

#### Dynamics of Goal Pursuit

##### Goal Proximity

As both humans and animals get closer to achieving a goal, they tend to increase their effort in achieving that desired outcome (Locke & Latham, 1984]]). For example, just as rats run more quickly as they approach food (Hull, 1934]]), consumers accelerate coffee purchases the closer they are to earning a free beverage (Kivetz et al., 2006]]). Donors are more likely to give to charity when the organization is closer to hitting a fundraising target (Cryder et al., 2013]]). This so-called goal gradient effect (Nunes & Dreze, 2006]]) reflects a basic feature of the dynamics of goal pursuit. More broadly, the small area hypothesis (Koo & Fishbach, 2012]]) suggests that it arises, in part, because paying attention to progress remaining is more motivating when there is less of it (e.g., “10% remaining” carries more impact than “90% completed”). Similarly, paying attention to progress accumulated is more motivating when there is less of it (e.g., “10% completed” carries more impact than “90% remaining”).

Therefore, if perceived progress increases the relative importance of a focal goal (with respect to an associated means), then it should also strengthen the desire for direct investment in goal attainment (i.e., investing resources higher in the goal hierarchy). As a result, individuals should feel a stronger desire to shift resources from means to goals. For example, actions can be interpreted either as conveying commitment or making progress (Fishbach & Dhar, 2005]]). And when actions reflect progress, rather than commitment, individuals have been shown to relax their pursuit of the focal goal. So, a commitment mindset should heighten the preference for shifting resources from means to goals. Or consider that when progress is low, concrete thinking can hurt motivation; when progress is high, however, it can help (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2009]]; Townsend & Liu, 2012]]). Thus, concrete construal, coupled with goal proximity, should increase WTP for goals, relative to means.

##### The Nature and Number of Goals and Means

During goal pursuit, the nature and number of available means can meaningfully shape motivation. For example, the availability of a greater number of means tends to increase commitment to a focal goal (Kruglanski et al., 2011]]). And when progress is low, people prefer different means (i.e., a variety of options; Etkin, 2022]]; Etkin & Ratner, 2012]]) and fewer means (i.e., a lower number of options; Huang & Zhang, 2013]]). Moreover, when imagining goal attainment in the distant future (vs. the near future), people prefer similar means (Etkin & Ratner, 2012]]). So, for example, gym-goers expressed greater WTP for training sessions that exercised similar muscle groups in the distant future and different muscle groups in the near future. These factors together suggest that the nature (e.g., similar vs. dissimilar) and number (e.g., few vs. many) of means can change the relative importance of a focal goal. And, as noted, when the relative importance of a focal goal increases, the desire for direct investment in goal attainment likewise increases, strengthening the desire to shift resources from means to goals.

Relatedly, the nature and number of goals matters as well. For example, the dilution model of self-regulation (Zhang et al., 2007]]) argues that increasing the number of goals (e.g., building muscles and losing weight) that a particular means (e.g., exercising) can satisfy tends to reduce perceived instrumentality (i.e., effectiveness). As a result, these multifinal means (i.e., when a single means serves multiple goals) are less likely to be chosen, relative to means that serve only a single goal. In the former case, therefore, the relative importance of the focal goal is heightened, compared with the latter case. And so too should the desire to shift resource investment from means to goals.

Finally, when people are intrinsically motivated, the preference to shift resources from means to goals should also attenuate. This is because when people are intrinsically motivated, they cannot separate pursuit of an activity from receipt of its benefits. In these situations, when individuals are intrinsically motivated, they experience a fusion between means and ends (Kruglanski et al., 2018]]; Woolley & Fishbach, 2017]], 2022). Meanwhile, the literature has identified a variety of factors that either increase or decrease the likelihood of such fusion occurring. For example, associative strength between goals and means (Bélanger et al., 2015]]), repeated pairings between goals and means over time (Kruglanski et al., 1975]]), and shorter temporal distance between goals and means (Woolley & Fishbach, 2017]]) can increase intrinsic motivation. This, in turn, should attenuate the preference to shift resources from means to goals because, in a sense, means are now experienced as goals (when intrinsic motivation is high).

#### Situational Factors

##### Construal Level

Construal level (Trope & Liberman, 2010]]) should also play a role—particularly when an abstract mindset boosts the relative importance of higher-order goals. This is consistent with work showing that abstract construal helps link an action to its superordinate purpose (Fishbach & Ferguson, 2007]], Kruglanski, 1995]]), which can, in turn, improve self-control (Fujita & Carnevale, 2012]]; Fujita & Han, 2009]]). So, for example, women who maintained the goal to lose weight were more likely to choose an apple over a candy bar when thinking abstractly, as opposed to concretely (Fujita & Han, 2009]]). Abstract construal should therefore increase the preference to shift resources from means to goals because high-level construal disproportionately benefits goals, which are inherently more abstract, relative to means—reinforcing the importance of those goals.

A corollary is that whether the goal itself is concrete or abstract should matter, too. For example, people sometimes pursue specific goals (e.g., lose 10 pounds); other times they pursue abstract goals (e.g., be healthy). And past work has found that when goals are specific, individuals pay greater attention to the end state (e.g., the 10 pounds); however, when goals are abstract, they pay disproportionate attention to the initial state (i.e., the status quo; Wallace & Etkin, 2018]]). Specific goals, in turn, tend to elicit stronger purchase intentions from consumers (Lee & Ariely, 2006]]; Suher et al., 2019]]). Relatedly, a fixed sequence of means to achieve a goal can be more motivating for completing goals but less motivating for adopting those goals in the first place (Jin et al., 2013]]). This is because people sometimes fail to anticipate how those fixed structures can help overcome difficulty during the course of goal pursuit (Huang et al., 2017]]). These findings collectively suggest that the more abstract a goal is, the “higher up” the hierarchy it will be positioned, thus placing more vertical distance between it and associated means, resulting in a magnification of the preference to pay more for goals than for means.

##### The Interconnected Self

Goals are often pursued in the presence of others, with various consequences for motivation. For example, a large literature has shown how and why the presence of similar others can both enhance the accessibility of related goals (Aarts et al., 2004]]; Fitzsimons & Finkel, 2010]]; Fitzsimons & Shah, 2008]]; J. Shah, 2003]]; Wills, 1981]]; Wood et al., 1985]]) and sometimes hurt motivation (Gardner et al., 2002]]; Huang, 2018]]; Lockwood & Kunda, 1997]]). Meanwhile, the mere presence of others can intensify goal pursuit (Shteynberg & Galinsky, 2011]]), particularly when it serves to validate the goal. Thus, when social context facilitates goal pursuit—boosting motivation for a focal goal—it magnifies the desire to directly invest resources in goals, triggering a stronger preference to shift resources from means to goals.

People can also impose goals on others. And a rich body of work in psychology has documented the importance of feeling personal control or autonomy over environments and outcomes (Cooper & Fazio, 1984]]; Skinner, 1995]]; Taylor & Brown, 1988]]; Weiner, 1985]]). Thus, when goals are externally imposed (vs. self-generated), motivation to achieve such goals suffers (Zhang et al., 2011]]). For example, participants who got to choose which environmental campaign to support volunteered for more hours than participants who were told which environmental campaign to support. Put differently, when the goals are imposed by others, they become means to another need (e.g., pleasing others). Thus, when personal control or autonomy is undermined, the preference to shift resources from means to goals attenuates because the focal goal has been devalued.

#### Individual Factors

##### Attributions

People sometimes “manufacture” goal progress (e.g., distort memories of past behavior) to license pursuit of a different or conflicting goal (May & Irmak, 2014]]). For example, consumers with savings goals who nevertheless wished to spend money on an indulgence tended to underestimate the amount previously spent to justify the desired impulse purchase. People also sometimes experience vicarious goal fulfillment (Wilcox et al., 2009)]], such that the mere presence of a healthy option can (paradoxically) increase choice of an unhealthy option. In these situations, motivation for the focal goal is almost by definition lower (i.e., given that people are conjuring creative workarounds to license disengagement). This implicitly devalues the focal goal, and so the preference to shift resources from means to goals should attenuate.

An extension of this reasoning is that when means are self-diagnostic—whether someone construes a particular action as representative of the type of person they are (Touré-Tillery, 2022]]; Touré-Tillery & Fishbach, [^2012], [^2015]; Touré-Tillery & Light, 2018]])—these actions will matter much more, in which case self-diagnosticity should attenuate WTP for goals, relative to means. This is because people form ideas about themselves (i.e., establish their self-concept) by observing their own behaviors and drawing inferences about themselves, and they are motivated to maintain positive self-concept (Bem, 1972]]; Bodner & Prelec, 1996]]; Dhar & Wertenbroch, 2012]]; Dunning, 2007]]; Gneezy, Gneezy, et al., 2012]]). In other words, when means reflect identity, they become relatively more important, and thus the preference to shift resources from means to goals attenuates as a result.

People also exhibit counteractive tendencies (Fishbach & Trope, 2005]]). For example, at the beginning of goal pursuit, people sometimes exaggerate their progress level to signal higher goal attainability and elicit greater effort (Huang et al., 2012]]). Or when encountering a temptation, they may intentionally construe it as more harmful to the attainment of a long-term goal than it actually is. Then, these distorted perceptions can help resolve conflict in favor of the protected goal (Zhang et al., 2010]]). In both cases people seem to be protecting, or shielding (Köpetz et al., 2011]]), their goals, thereby bolstering their importance, relative to means (resulting in a stronger preference to shifting resources from means to goals).

##### Individual Differences

A number of individual differences should matter as well. For example, the Persistence–Licensing Response Measure (PLRM; Zemack-Rugar et al., 2019]]) captures chronic response tendencies to goal progress. As noted, in some situations people make progress toward a goal and then balance, switching to pursuit of a different goal; in other situations people make progress toward a goal and then highlight, continuing pursuit of the same goal (Fishbach & Dhar, 2005]]; Fishbach et al., 2006]]). Importantly, these response tendencies—whether people respond to progress with balancing versus highlighting—are stable personal traits, allowing for measurement by the PLRM. Thus, if some people are systematically more likely to balance versus highlight after making progress toward a goal, then they also likely believe those goals are less important (i.e., consequently, they pursue other more important goals). People who chronically balance, therefore, relative to people who chronically highlight should less reliably shift resources from means to a focal goal, once they have made progress toward that focal goal.

Another relevant individual difference is regulatory focus, which distinguishes between prevent and promotion focus (Higgins, 1997]]). People who are prevention-focused are more motivated by a desire for security, while those who are promotion-focused are more motivated by a desire for achievement. When people take actions that fit their regulatory orientation, motivation is higher (e.g., when a prevention-focused individual earns an A to feel secure about their goal to pass a course or when a promotion-focused individual earns an A to feel achievement about their goal to make the honor roll). To that end, past work has documented similar positive effects for WTP. For example, when there is high regulatory fit, consumers express greater purchase intentions (Avnet & Higgins, 2006]]; Chernev, 2004]]; Higgins et al., 2003]]). Additionally, promotion-focused consumers have been shown to prefer hierarchically structured choice sets, while prevention-focused consumers prefer nonhierarchically structured item lists.

Given that the preference for shifting resources from means to goals is driven by the hierarchical structure of goal systems (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; Shaddy & Fishbach, 2018]]) and past work has found that people who are promotion-focused prefer hierarchy, they should experience greater sensitivity to the motivational impact of vertical distance between goals and means. In other words, a promotion focus should make more salient the hierarchical relationship between goals and means. And since this hierarchical relationship explains the preference to shift resources from means to goals, it should produce a stronger desire for directly investing resources in goals (as opposed to indirectly investing resources in means).

Relatedly, regulatory mode (e.g., locomotion versus assessment; Higgins et al., 2003]]) should similarly matter. Locomotors tend to care more about movement forward (i.e., progress toward a goal) than about the end result (i.e., the goal itself), suggesting greater relative importance for means, as opposed to goals. Assessors, on the other hand, tend to be more focused on the value of what they are pursuing (i.e., the goal), suggesting greater relative importance for goals. Therefore, locomotion should decrease willingness to shift resources from means to goals, while assessment should increase it.

##### Scarcity and Depletion

Scarcity can take multiple forms (A. K. Shah et al., 2015]]). For example, consumers often experience resource scarcity, whether they lack sufficient money, time, or energy (Shaddy & Shah, 2018]], 2022). And people systematically differ according to how they respond to that resource scarcity—some people react by focusing on scarcity reduction (e.g., acquire more of the scarce resource), while others engage in a control-restoration response (e.g., seek control in other domains; Cannon et al., 2019]]). This latter response—seeking control in other domains—suggests a devaluation of the focal goal, likely reducing the preference to shift resources from means to goals. This is because devaluation of a focal goal should undermine the desire to directly invest resources in goals.

Meanwhile, cognitive scarcity (i.e., when mental resources are depleted) can hamper self-control in numerous ways (for a review, see Vohs, 2006]]) because mental resources are required for self-regulation (i.e., dogged pursuit of a single goal to the exclusion of others is effortful; Baumeister & Heatherton, 1996]]). So, for example, temptations are more difficult to resist during high levels of cognitive depletion (De Ridder et al., 2012]]; Hoffman et al., 2012]]; Metcalfe & Mischel, 1999]]; Shiv & Fedorikhin, 1999]]). Therefore, to the extent that the availability of mental resources helps people focus on the importance of achieving their goals, cognitive scarcity may reduce WTP for goals, relative to means (i.e., causing them to take their “eye off the ball,” so to speak). And increasing the importance of a focal goal should increase the desire to invest resources directly in its attainment (as opposed to investing resources in means).

### Resources as Means to Ends

More broadly, resources can be treated as means to ends or ends in and of themselves. To offer a simple example, money is a resource that can be exchanged for goods and services in the marketplace. People work to earn money, which, as a fiat currency (Walsh, 2017]]), does not possess any inherent value and cannot be used as anything but a medium of exchange. But these resources are often fungible, meaning that one can be exchanged for another.

Consider that consumers can often “buy time” with money (Whillans et al., 2017]]). For example, when participants were asked to spend $40 in each of two consecutive weekends and then randomly assigned to spend that money on either a purchase that would save time (e.g., paying for a cleaning service) or a material purchase (e.g., buying new clothes), they reported being in better moods on weekends during which they spent money to buy time. This effect was mediated by reduced feelings of stress.

Importantly, the framework explicated herein might shed additional light on why exchanging resources in this way yields greater happiness. Recall that when given the opportunity, people systematically prefer to shift resources away from means and toward goals (Shaddy & Fishbach, 2018]]). This is because when individuals allocate resources across goals and means, they perceive investing resources in goals as a direct investment in goal attainment (i.e., higher in the goal hierarchy). Meanwhile, they perceive investing resources in means as an indirect investment in goal attainment (i.e., lower in the goal hierarchy).

People also often experience time scarcity (i.e., feeling as though one does not have enough time; Godbey, et al., 1998]]; Zuzanek et al., 1998]]), suggesting that acquiring more time might be, for some, construed as a goal in and of itself (because it is inherently valuable), unlike acquiring more money (which is not inherently valuable). Thus, by spending money (a means) to acquire time (a goal), individuals effectively shift resources from means to goals—nudging the action higher up the goal hierarchy. And, indeed, greater monetary wealth confers greater autonomy over how individuals choose to spend their time (Gallo & Matthews, 2003]]; Kraus et al., 2012]]). No wonder that having more time is associated with greater happiness (Kasser & Sheldon, 2009]]). More broadly, what this reasoning potentially suggests is the possibility that viewing any resource as a goal, as opposed to a means, can increase the subjective value of that resource. Perhaps this is part of the reason why even millionaires wish they had more money—especially when being wealthy is socially valuable (Kruglanski et al., 2021]])—and those who earned their wealth (i.e., pursued its accumulation as a goal in and of itself) tend to be happier than those who inherited it (Donnelly et al., 2018]]).

### Conclusion

This chapter explained how the architecture of goal systems systematically shapes judgment and decision-making with respect to the allocation of scarce resources—specifically, by discussing goal systems theory in light of consumer behavior research. This is a broadly important topic, given that consumers frequently incur costs associated with goals and costs associated with means. For example, shoppers at big-box warehouse clubs need to pay money for both membership (invest in means) and goods (invest in goals). To that end, this chapter offered an overview of recent work documenting how and why people systematically prefer shifting resources (e.g., time, money, effort) from means to goals (even holding total resource allocation and goal attainment constant), discussed implications for pricing, proposed a set of moderating variables, and suggested fruitful directions for future research.

Advancing Understanding of Equifinality in Goal Systems

Jordan Etkin

Goals play a critical role in daily life. From what time to wake up and what to eat for breakfast to which career to pursue and whether to have children, many, if not most, of people’s decisions are guided by their goals. Goals influence the goods we buy, the activities we engage in, and the experiences we pursue (Baumgartner et al., 2008]]; Köpetz et al., 2012]]; Ligas, 2000]]; Van Osselaer & Janiszewski, 2012]]; Van Osselaer et al., 2005]]). They affect how we allocate our time, money, and energy (Fernbach et al., 2015]]; Jhang & Lynch, 2015]]; Orehek & Vazeou-Nieuwenhuis, 2013]]; Shaddy & Fishbach, 2018]]) and how we cultivate relationships with other people (Finkel et al., 2014]]; Fitzsimons & Shah, 2008]]; Orehek & Forest, 2016]]; Orehek et al., 2018]]). Even when we are not consciously aware of their influence, goals shape much of our behavior (Bargh et al., 2001]]; Chartrand et al., 2008]]; Fitzsimons & Bargh, 2003]]; Shah, 2005]]; Shah & Kruglanski, 2003]]).

Introduced in 2002, goal systems theory offers a broad theoretical perspective on such goal-directed behavior (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; see Chapter 1]] in this volume). _Goal systems_ refers to the mental representations of motivational networks composed of interconnected goals and means, where _means_ refers to the products, services, and behaviors that people buy, choose, or otherwise enact to advance a focal goal (Etkin & Ratner, 2012]]; Köpetz et al., 2012]]; Pieters et al., 1995]]). Means to a goal for physical fitness, for example, could include athletic equipment and protein supplements, personal trainers and gym memberships, or playing sports and weight training. Means to a goal for professional achievement could include electronics like smartphones and laptops, career coaches and training programs, or scheduling meetings and taking classes. Most goals are associated with multiple means, together referred to as the _equifinality set_ (Baumgartner et al., 2008]]; Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; Markman et al., 2007]]).

Research on equifinality configurations has largely focused on the size of the set, or the number of means attached to a given goal. Most practically, equifinality set size determines how many means are available for goal pursuit. Larger numbers allow people more choice in how to pursue a goal and afford greater opportunity to switch to alternative means upon failure of a given means to advance the goal (Dalton & Spiller, 2012]]; Han & Gershoff, 2019]]; Huang & Zhang, 2013]]; Kruglanski & Jaffe, 1988]]). Further, in addition to means selection and substitution, equifinality set size affects the strength of means–goal connections. Similar to the notion of a fan effect (Anderson, [^1974], [^1983]), the greater the number of means connected to a given goal, the weaker the connection between the goal and any one of its means (Kruglanski et al. 2002]]; Zhang et al., 2007]]). The strength of such connections determines the extent to which means activate goals (or vice versa) as well as the transfer of motivational and affective properties between goals and means (Bélanger et al., 2015]]; Danner et al., 2007]]; Ferguson & Bargh, 2004]]; Fishbach & Ferguson, 2007]]; Fishbach et al., 2004]]; Kruglanski et al., 2011]]; Shah & Kruglanski, 2003]]).

### Variety among Means

Reading this work on equifinality set size as a doctoral student, my own thinking turned toward what characteristics of multiple means, beyond number, may contribute to how means influence goals. Indeed, the marketing literature has found many aspects of assortments to affect consumer decision-making and behavior (Chernev, 2003a]], 2003b]]; Gourville & Soman, 2005]]; Hsee & Zhang, 2010]]; Simonson & Tversky, 1992]]; Tversky & Simonson, 1993]]), suggesting that additional factors could be relevant too for understanding how assortments of means influence behavior toward goals.

One such property that especially captured my attention was that of the relationship among items in the set, that is, the variation or “variety” in the assortment (Broniarczyk et al., 1998]]; Hoch et al., 1999]]; Kahn & Wansink, 2004]]). Similar to other assortments, assortments of means to a goal seemed like they could differ in variety, with some assortments incorporating a greater variety of items and others incorporating less variety. Means to a fitness goal, for example, could include free weights, protein shakes, and cutting calories (an objectively more varied set) or, instead, free weights, a stationary bicycle, and a weight rack (an objectively less varied set of all gym equipment).

Formerly, in my dissertation I proposed the concept of _variety among means_, defined as the perceived degree of differentiation among multiple means to a goal (i.e., its equifinality set; Etkin & Ratner, [^2012], [^2013]). I argued that such perceptions could depend on the objective similarities or differences among means, such as the number of different attributes or the magnitude of such differences (smaller differences, such as different flavors of a certain type of product, affording less variety among items, or larger differences, such as different types of products, affording more variety among items). In addition, subjective judgments could play a role, such as the extent to which similarities or differences among means are salient to a given individual or in a given situation. For instance, the same set of means (e.g., an assortment of home gym equipment) could be perceived as less varied when individuals focus on what means have in common (e.g., all items are weights) or more varied when they focus on what makes those items unique (e.g., their specific form—dumbbells, kettlebells, or barbells).

This dissertation served as the basis of a research program developed over the next decade in which I have sought to understand how variety among means contributes to various goal-related phenomena. In the next sections of this chapter, I distill some of the key empirical findings from three streams of research, integrate and draw connections across studies, and conclude with a call for further research.

### Empirical Findings: Motivation, Goal Progress, Expectancies

In this first section, I review empirical findings on how variety among means shapes “classic” goal-related phenomena. These include people’s motivation to pursue a goal, how they perceive goal progress, and their expectations regarding future goal attainment.

#### Variety and Motivation

My initial dissertation research (Etkin & Ratner, [^2012], [^2013]) explored how variety among means affects motivation. Building on the goal systems theory principle that goals and means are cognitively linked (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]) and that properties of means can transfer to affect feelings and behaviors toward goals and vice versa (Fishbach & Ferguson, 2007]]; Fishbach et al., 2004]]), we considered whether the variety among available means to a goal might make people more or less motivated to pursue the goal and two specific circumstances under which variety can have both beneficial and detrimental effects.

Etkin and Ratner (2012)]] examined how variety among means influences motivation as a function of perceived progress toward the goal. We hypothesized that when goal progress is low and people feel far from achieving their goal, more (vs. less) variety among means would help alleviate the uncertainty inherent in the pursuit and thus increase motivation (see also Chapter 5]] in this volume). When goal progress is high and people feel close to achieving their goal, however, we argued that less (vs. more) variety among means would offer a more focused approach to getting the rest of the way to the goal and thus increase motivation. Accordingly, we manipulated (or measured) whether participants perceived low or high progress toward their goal and tested the effect of variety among means on motivation.

In one study (Etkin & Ratner, 2012]], Study 1a), participants considered a focal goal (to get in better shape), and we manipulated perceived goal progress by varying the response options for questions about recent exercise behavior (designed to make participants feel they had made a little or a lot of recent progress toward their goal; cf. Fishbach & Dhar, 2005]]). Then, participants considered multiple available means to a fitness goal, and we manipulated the variety among the set. Half of the participants viewed a low-variety set of means (six protein bars differing only in flavor), and the other half viewed a high-variety set (six protein supplements of different form and flavor). Finally, we measured motivation by asking participants to report their commitment and willingness to devote effort to their goal. Supporting our theory, when goal progress seemed low, having a more varied set of means in mind increased motivation to pursue the goal; but when goal progress seemed high, having a less varied set of means in mind increased motivation.

In another study (Etkin & Ratner, 2012]], Study 1b), participants reported their own perceptions of progress toward a personal fitness goal, and we manipulated variety among means by priming participants to think about similarities (low-variety condition) versus differences (high-variety condition) among a fixed set of six fitness-related means. Consistent with the prior results, at lower levels of perceived goal progress, perceiving more variety among means increased motivation; but at higher levels of perceived goal progress, perceiving less variety among means increased motivation.

In a third study (Etkin & Ratner, 2012]], Study 3), we manipulated perceived goal progress (toward an academic goal) using a similar manipulation to Study 1a (i.e., asking questions about recent behaviors that brought shorter vs. longer periods of studying to mind). Then, participants viewed a list of four behaviors related to an academic goal (reading a textbook, meeting with a tutor, attending a review session, and reading supplementary materials). They were either asked to describe how these behaviors were similar to one another (low-variety condition) or different from one another (high-variety condition), prior to completing a goal-related task (solving anagrams) on which we measured their performance. Consistent with the prior results, when goal progress seemed low, perceiving more variety among means increased performance on the goal-related task; but when goal progress seemed high, perceiving less variety among means increased task performance.

Extending these findings, Etkin and Ratner (2013)]] explored how variety among means influences motivation as a function of future time perspective (i.e., when in the future people anticipate pursuing their goal). When people focus on the near future, they tend to adopt a concrete mindset and represent information at a lower level of construal. When people focus on the far future, in contrast, they tend to adopt an abstract mindset and represent information at a higher level of construal (Förster, 2009]]; Trope & Liberman, 2000]]). Importantly, this difference in construal level affects the extent to which people attend to and naturally perceive differences (lower level of construal) versus similarities (higher level of construal) among items in an assortment. We therefore reasoned that, the easier it is to perceive differences versus similarities among means to a goal, the more compatible those means should be with a near versus far future mindset and the more motivated people should be to pursue their goal in the near versus far future (Cesario et al., 2004]]; Fishbach et al., 2004]]). Accordingly, we hypothesized that, when people consider pursuing a goal in the near future (and spontaneously focus on differences among means), perceiving more (vs. less) variety among means should result in greater motivation. When people consider pursuing a goal in the far future (and spontaneously focus on similarities among means), however, perceiving less (vs. more) variety among means should result in greater motivation. Accordingly, we manipulated whether participants considered pursuing their goal in the near (or immediate) versus far future and tested how variety among means influenced motivation.

In one study (Etkin & Ratner, 2013]], Study 3), participants identified a personal savings goal for either right now (near future condition) or over the next year (far future condition) and then listed three similar approaches to meeting their savings goal (low-variety condition) or three different approaches (high-variety condition). Then, they reported their motivation and commitment to saving money. As predicted, thinking about a more varied set of means increased motivation in the near term (to save money right now), but thinking about a less varied set of means increased motivation in the far term (to save money over the next year).

In another study (Etkin & Ratner, 2013]], Study 2), participants chose a total of two protein bars (two different kinds, i.e., varied means, or two of the same, i.e., identical means), and we manipulated whether they anticipated receiving these protein bars at the end of the experimental session (near future condition) or when they returned to the lab next month (far future condition). After making their selections, we measured the number of times participants intended to exercise in the coming week. Participants were more likely to choose varied means when they expected to receive the protein bars immediately following the experimental session than when they expected to receive them the following month. Further, consistent with the prior results, among participants who chose for the near future, those who selected varied (vs. identical) means expressed greater exercise intentions, whereas among participants who chose for the far future, those who selected identical (vs. varied) means expressed greater exercise intentions.

Together, the studies by Etkin and Ratner ([^2012], [^2013]) demonstrate that variety among means plays an important role in motivation. Further, how variety among means influences motivation depends on contextual factors such as perceived progress toward the goal and temporal planning horizon. When goal progress is low or people plan for goal pursuit in the near term, having (or perceiving) a variety of available means increases motivation. When goal progress is high or people plan for goal pursuit in the future, having (or perceiving) little variation among means increases motivation. Although one could wonder whether goal progress should similarly affect psychological distance and show the opposite pattern of results (greater motivation from variety when progress is high vs. low), ancillary data shows that goal progress and temporal distance are distinct constructs that separately influence the dynamics of motivation (Etkin & Ratner, 2013]]; see also Chapter 5]] in this volume).

The findings offer practical advice for managing personal motivation. Since perceptions of variety are malleable and sensitive to cues that direct attention (Etkin & Ratner [^2012], [^2013]; see also Goodman & Malkoc, 2012]]; Kahn & Wansink, 2004]]; Mogilner et al., 2008]]), focusing on similarities among means when one feels close to achieving a goal and focusing on differences when anticipating goal pursuit in the near future should help boost motivation and encourage goal-consistent action.

#### Variety and Goal Progress

Extending this work on variety and motivation, the next series of studies explored how variety among means influences judgments of goal progress. Based on the goal systems theory notion that people have multiple goals and finite attentional resources (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]), prior work has argued (and shown) that an initial goal-congruent choice can reduce subsequent motivation (i.e., liberate people to pursue other goals; Dhar & Simonson, 1999]]; Khan & Dhar, 2006]]; Koo & Fishbach, 2008]]). This occurs because goal-congruent choice creates a perception of goal progress, signaling that people can release this focal goal and direct their attention and efforts toward alternative goals (Carver & Scheier, 1998]]; Fishbach & Dhar, 2005]]). Building on these findings, Etkin and Laran (2019)]] hypothesized that restricting people’s sense of freedom in their choice of means would undermine their perception of having accomplished sufficient goal progress to justify goal disengagement. In particular, because restricting choice freedom weakens the inferences people draw from their choices (Averill, 1973]]; Botti & McGill, 2011]]; DeCharms, 1968]]; Langer, 1975]]) and the inference of goal progress is what causes people to release their goal following goal-congruent choice (Fishbach & Dhar, 2005]]), reducing perceived choice freedom should keep people from releasing the goal, mitigating the decline (i.e., increasing) post-choice motivation.

To test these hypotheses, in one study (Etkin & Laran, 2019]], Study 1), participants considered multiple available means for a specific goal (e.g., a goal to do well academically), and we manipulated choice freedom. In particular, half of the participants could choose from a variety of means to pursue their goal (i.e., a variety of academic tasks; high freedom condition), and the other half had the means chosen for them (low-variety condition). After completing this first task (the same series of six anagrams, regardless of condition), all participants completed a second academic task (a single, unsolvable anagram), and we measured how long they persisted. As expected, participants whose freedom to choose a means was previously restricted persisted for longer (i.e., were more motivated) than those whose freedom was not restricted.

In another study (Etkin & Laran, 2019]], Study 2), participants considered multiple means (10 healthy snacks) to a healthy eating goal, and we manipulated their freedom to choose a varied assortment. Consistent with the prior result, after making their selections, those whose choice freedom was restricted (vs. not) reported lower perceptions of goal progress (i.e., that their choice of healthy snacks accomplished less toward their goal of being healthy) and consumed fewer calories (i.e., were more motivated) on a subsequent task.

These findings provide preliminary evidence that variety among means plays a role in judgments of goal progress and subsequent goal-directed behavior. Choosing a varied assortment of means can increase the progress those activities are perceived to accomplish and, as a result, influence how motivated people are to continue pursuing the goal.

#### Variety and Future Expectations

Moving beyond motivation and goal progress, a third series of studies (Abreu et al., 2022]]) explores how variety among means shapes expectations (or forecasts) of future goal outcomes. In particular, this work focuses on people’s expectations of encountering conflict with a focal goal in the future as a function of the variety of conflicts they’ve experienced with this goal in the past.

In addition to means to goal attainment, goal systems theory posits that goals can be cognitively linked to means that impede their pursuit, referred to as _negative means_ (i.e., hindrances or barriers to goal attainment; Lewin, 1935]]; Oettingen, 2000]]). Such negative means cause “goal conflict” (Boudreaux & Ozer, 2013]]; Hofmann et al., 2012]]; Jhang & Lynch, 2015]]; Oettingen et al., 2001]]) and more generally interfere with or hurt people’s ability to successfully achieve their goal.

Abreu et al. (2022)]] argue that, similar to variety among means that advance goal pursuit (Etkin & Ratner, [^2012], [^2013]), people may encounter multiple events that interfere or conflict with a goal and that these events may also differ in variety. Circumstances that conflict with the pursuit of a fitness goal, for example, could include low energy, poor sleep, and a lack of commitment to exercising (a low-variety set of conflicts) or low energy, an injury, and a childcare conflict (a high-variety set of conflicts). The same experiences of goal conflict can also be perceived as more or less varied, depending on whether individuals focus on similar versus distinct aspects of those events. We hypothesized that perceiving more variety among past episodes of goal conflict would reduce expectations of future goal conflict and that this would occur due to a shift in causal attribution (i.e., attributing past events to unstable, external, and specific vs. stable, internal, and general underlying causes; Buehler et al., 1994]]; Snyder & Higgins, 1988]]; Weiner, 1985]]) that diminishes the perceived relevance of those events to future outcomes.

To test these hypotheses, in one study, participants described a personal goal with which they had recently experienced conflict and reported their expectations of experiencing goal conflict again in the coming week. Then, they rated the variety among their past conflict experiences, and we looked at the relationship between variety and expected future conflict. As predicted, perceiving more variety among past episodes of goal conflict corresponded to lower expectations of goal conflict in the future.

In another study, participants were randomly assigned to consider a diet, budget, or exercise goal and three past instances of goal conflict. We manipulated perceptions of variety by directing one group of participants to elaborate on how those events were similar to each other (low-variety condition) and another group to elaborate on how those events were different from each other (high-variety condition); a third control group just read the events with no specific prompt. Participants then reported their expectations of future conflict and causal attributions for the set of three past events (internal–external, stable–unstable, global–specific). As predicted, across goal replicates, perceiving more (vs. less) variety among past episodes of goal conflict decreased expectations of future goal conflict, and this was driven by attributing past events to more unstable, external, and specific (vs. stable, internal, and general) causes.

Additional studies used a different (behavioral) paradigm to examine expectations following real conflict experiences. Participants played a two-period game for the chance to earn bonus pay. We manipulated whether they encountered more or less varied conflicts (i.e., task interruptions) in Round 1 and measured their expectations about future disruptions in Round 2. Consistent with the prior results, variety reduced expectations of future conflict and decreased efforts to mitigate future interference.

Together, these findings reveal that the variety among past events (in this case, experiences of goal conflict) can influence future expectations related to one’s goals. The focus on goal conflict and impacts of variation among such experiences joins other recent efforts to understand how negative or inhibitory links between means and goals affect goal systemic phenomena (e.g., counterfinality; Schumpe et al., 2018]]; see Chapter 1]] in this volume).

### Empirical Findings: Happiness, Satisfaction, and Identity

The work discussed thus far has focused on situations where individuals have a specific focal goal and strive to make progress toward its attainment. Goal systems theory also offers insights, however, into the advancement of more abstract, higher-order goals, including those for happiness, social connection, identity, morality, and political beliefs (Diener et al., 1995]]; King et al., 1998]]; Kruglanski et al., 2013]]). Such overarching “superordinate goals” are also pursued via multiple means to attainment, and in a second stream of research I have explored how variety among means shapes several such pursuits.

#### Happiness from Day-to-Day Activities

Happiness is one of people’s most fundamental pursuits (Diener et al. 1995]]; Freedman, 1978]]), and decisions about how to spend time play an important role (Kahneman et al., 2004]]). Extending prior research on how specific types of activities influence happiness (Bhattacharjee & Mogilner, 2014]]; Caprariello & Reis, 2013]]; Mogilner, 2010]]), Etkin and Mogilner (2016)]] examined how variety among people’s day-to-day activities shapes the happiness they derive from that time.

Indeed, within a given period of time people may engage in multiple activities, and these activities may differ in variety. An hour at work, for example, could be spent doing more varied activities (e.g., answering emails, attending meetings, completing individual work) or less varied activities (e.g., attending meetings for different projects or tasks); a weekend afternoon could be spent doing more varied activities (e.g., running errands, getting coffee with friends) or less varied activities (e.g., running multiple different errands; see also Lyubomirsky et al., 2005]]). We hypothesized that greater variation in activities can make people happier but doesn’t always and that whether variety increases happiness depends on the perceived duration within which the activities occur: Over longer time periods (like a day), more varied activities do increase happiness; but over shorter time periods (like an hour), more varied activities instead decrease happiness. We predicted that this would occur due to variety making longer periods feel both more exciting and shorter periods feel less productive, increasing versus decreasing happiness.

To test these hypotheses, in one study (Etkin & Mogilner, 2016]], Study 2a), participants thought about the activities they had done over the past 10 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour, a day, a week, or a month. We manipulated perceived variety by asking them to list either similar (low-variety condition) or different (high-variety condition) examples of activities and measured how happy they felt looking back on the time. As predicted, perceiving more variety among one’s activities increased happiness for the longer periods (a day, a week, and a month) but decreased happiness for the shorter periods (10 minutes, 30 minutes, and an hour).

In other studies (Etkin & Mogilner, 2016]], Studies 1a and 1b), we instructed participants to actually spend the next day (long-duration condition) or hour (short-duration condition) doing more or less varied activities and measured their happiness at the end of the period. Consistent with the prior result, over a day, spending time on more (vs. less) varied activities increased happiness, but over an hour spending time on more (vs. less) varied activities reduced happiness.

Additional studies manipulated perceived (rather than actual) time duration and revealed the underlying process: Whereas filling longer time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel more stimulating (which increases happiness), filling shorter time periods with more varied activities makes the time feel less productive (which decreases happiness).

Together, these findings reveal that variety among means to a happy life can both advance and undermine this pursuit and that whether variation in one’s day-to-day activities increases or decreases happiness depends on the horizon over which the goal is pursued.

#### Identity Continuity

Like happiness, the cultivation and maintenance of personal identity is a superordinate goal that plays an important role in many day-to-day decisions (Belk, 1988]]; Parfit, 1984]]; Reed, 2004]]; Sirgy, 1982]]). People make choices and exert effort to manage their identity in the moment (Berger & Heath, 2007]]; Gao et al., 2009]]; Rucker & Galinsky, 2008]]) and over time (Quoidbach et al., 2013]]; Markus & Kunda, 1986]]), leveraging products, services, and other means to increase or decrease beliefs about the continuity of their identity (Sarial-Abi et al., 2017]]; Sedikides et al., 2008]]; Türe & Ger, 2016]]). Building on these findings, Rifkin and Etkin (2019)]] explored how variety among means to self-expression affects such judgments of self-continuity.

By means to self-expression, we referred to curated assortments or lists that people use to describe who they are. Such self-expression-via-assortments is increasingly common in digital contexts, such as dating profiles, social media accounts, and other online streaming or subscription services that ask individuals to present themselves through collections of their likes, tastes, and preferences. We hypothesized that perceiving greater variety in such self-expressive assortments would undermine the belief that one’s identity stays the same over time by reducing perceived stability in one’s identity.

To test these hypotheses, in one study (Rifkin & Etkin, 2019]], Study 1a), participants read about a new social media platform and were asked to select five from among 16 items in one of four entertainment domains (music, TV, books, public radio) to include in their personal profile. Half of participants were asked to choose the domain that most expressed who they are as a person (high-expressiveness condition) and half the domain that least expressed who they are as a person (low-expressiveness condition). We manipulated perceived variety by giving participants false feedback about the contents of their assortment (that it contained more or less variety relative to their peers) and measured self-continuity via self-report. As expected, perceiving more variety in a self-expressive assortment undermined perceived self-continuity; this effect did not emerge in the low-expressiveness condition.

In another study (Rifkin & Etkin, 2019]], Study 2), participants read about a new entertainment subscription service that would send monthly recommendations and constructed a self-expressive assortment (of books or magazines, whichever they identified as more self-expressive) as input for these suggestions. We manipulated perceived variety via social information (i.e., telling participants that their selections contained more or less variety than a majority of their peers) and then measured perceived preference stability in the choice domain along with self-continuity. Consistent with the prior results, perceiving more variety in a self-expressive assortment undermined self-continuity, and this was driven by inferring unstable preferences in the consumption domain.

Together, these findings reveal that variety among means to self-expression can shape perceptions of one’s identity. Although people may communicate varied preferences to others to signal desirable qualities (e.g., that one is interesting or has expertise; Ratner & Kahn, 2002]]; Sela et al., 2019]]), such choices may inadvertently communicate information to the self that one’s preferences are variable and changing, reducing the (often desirable and beneficial) belief that one’s identity stays the same over time.

#### Relationship Satisfaction

A final superordinate goal that I have explored in my work is that of relationship satisfaction. Relationships with other people—romantic partners, friends, and family—are integral to physical and psychological well-being (Baumeister & Leary, 1995]]), and a substantial body of research has sought to understand means to maintaining good relationships. Among robust predictors, variety (or similarity) between partners plays an important role (Blazer, 1963]]; Meyer & Pepper, 1977]]; Murstein & Beck, 1972]]; Rusbult et al., 2009]]; White & Hatcher, 1984]]). Similarity between partners in terms of attitudes (Byrne, 1971]]; Byrne & Blaylock, 1963]]), values (Eastwick et al., 2011]]; Lutz-Zois et al., 2006]]), personality traits (Lewak et al., 1985]]; Nemecheck & Olson, 1999), and interests (Lutz-Zois et al., 2006]]; Swim & Surra, 1999]]), for example, has been found to enhance relationship satisfaction and well-being. Building on these findings about interpersonal similarity, Etkin & Berger (2022)]] explored how variety among joint activities performed by relationship partners shapes relationship well-being.

Socioemotional selectivity theory posits that preferences regarding social interaction partners vary as a function of future time perspective (or its correlates, like age), such that for people who perceive much time ahead left in life (e.g., younger people), novel interaction partners are more instrumental to their goals, and for people who perceive little time ahead left in life (e.g., older people), familiar interaction partners are more instrumental to their goals (Carstensen et al., [^1997], [^1999]). Related work shows that exciting products and experiences tend to make younger people happy, whereas calming products and experiences make older people happy (Mogilner et al., [^2011], [^2012]). Integrating these findings, we hypothesized that, because greater variation should make shared experiences feel more exciting (Etkin, 2016]]; see also Aron et al., 2000]]) and excitement should be more instrumental to relationship goals when people see more (vs. less) time ahead in the relationship, perceiving more (vs. less) variety among joint activities should make people in such “younger” (vs. “older”) relationships more motivated to invest in their relationships (i.e., relationship motivation; Rusbult et al., 1998]]). Conversely, because lesser variation should make shared experiences feel calmer and calmness should be more instrumental to relationship goals when people see less (vs. more) time ahead in the relationship, perceiving less (vs. more) variety among joint activities should make people in “older” (vs. “younger”) relationships more motivated to invest in their relationships.

To test these hypotheses, in one study, participants who were currently involved in a monogamous romantic relationship were randomly assigned to list similar activities they had done with their partner in the past week (low-variety condition) or different activities (high-variety condition). After this, we gave participants an opportunity to write about their current relationship, spending as much time on this task as they wished, and then measured how long (in years and months) they had been in their current relationship. As expected, for younger (i.e., shorter) relationships, perceiving more variety among their joint activities increased how much time participants spent writing about their relationship, whereas for older (i.e., longer) relationships, this pattern reversed.

Because time spent writing about the relationship could reflect stronger positive feelings (as intended) or negative feelings (e.g., venting or frustration), the next study measured positive sentiment more directly: willingness to spend money on dinner. We manipulated perceived relationship duration by altering response scales (see Etkin & Ratner, 2012]]) to questions about relationship length, had participants list similar or different joint activities, and then asked them how much they would spend (in dollars) to take their partner out to dinner for a special occasion. Consistent with the prior results, in the short-duration condition, recalling more (vs. less) varied joint activities increased willingness to spend on dinner, whereas in the long-duration condition, this effect reversed.

Additional studies identified the underlying roles of excitement and stability: For younger relationships perceiving more variety among joint activities increased positive feelings by making the relationship feel more exciting, but for older relationships perceiving more variety among joint activities increased positive feelings by making the relationship feel stable and calm.

Together, these findings reveal that, similar to variety among means to a happy life (Etkin & Mogilner, 2016]]), variety among means to a satisfying relationship can both advance and undermine this pursuit and that whether variation in the joint activities performed together with one’s partner increases or decreases positive feelings toward the relationship depends on the (actual or perceived) “age” of the relationship.

### Empirical Findings: Variety as a Goal

Thus far, variety has been conceptualized as a characteristic of multiple means that influences the impact of those means on related judgments, decisions, and behaviors. However, variety can also be desirable in and of itself; people have positive associations with variety (Ratner & Kahn, 2002]]) and have been known to choose variety just for its own sake, even at the expense of selecting less preferred items (Ariely & Levav, 2000]]; Fishbach et al., 2011]]; Kahn, 1995]]; Ratner et al., 1999]]; Simonson 1990]]). In a third stream of research, I have explored when and why people pursue variety as a goal.

#### Variety in Joint Activities

One context in which variety can serve as a goal is within close relationships. As previously discussed, people invest considerable effort in managing relationship satisfaction (Rusbult et al., 1998]]), and one way to do so is through the activities they choose to do together with their partner (Aron et al., 2000]]). Etkin (2016)]] examines when individuals seek (vs. avoid) variety among such joint activities and demonstrates the perceived time left ahead in the relationship to play a critical role.

In particular, because variety is a means to excitement (Etkin & Mogilner, 2016]]; Menon & Kahn, 1995]]) and people value excitement to a greater extent when they perceive more (vs. less) future time ahead of them (i.e., have a longer [vs. shorter] future time perspective; Etkin & Berger, 2022]]; Mogilner et al., 2012]]), I expected that perceiving more (vs. less) future time ahead in a committed relationship would increase the value (or instrumentality) of variety as a means to goals for relationship satisfaction and therefore increase the extent to which people seek variety in their joint consumption choices. Accordingly, I hypothesized that, when people perceive more (vs. less) future time ahead in a committed relationship, they should prefer greater variety in their joint consumption experiences, driven by differences in the value of excitement as a means to relationship satisfaction.

To test these hypotheses, in one study (Etkin, 2016]], Study 1), participants who were currently involved in a monogamous romantic relationship were randomly assigned to describe how the future time ahead of their relationship was short (short–future horizon condition) or long (long–future horizon condition) and then to choose from a list of five activities they could do over the coming week. Half of the participants were asked to choose activities they would like to do together with their partner (joint consumption condition) and half to choose activities they would like to do by themselves (solo consumption condition). As expected, perceiving more (vs. less) future time ahead in the relationship increased choice of variety for joint consumption; this effect did not emerge in the solo consumption condition.

In another study (Etkin, 2016]], Study 2), participants identified the name of a close friend and were randomly assigned to describe how the future time ahead of their friendship was short (short–future horizon condition) or long (long–future horizon condition). Half were then asked to name the last place they had shared a meal with this friend (joint consumption condition) and the other half to name the last place where they had eaten by themselves (solo consumption condition). All participants then identified two options for where they could eat next, one that was very similar to where they’d last eaten and one that would be very different, and to choose one of these options, with the latter, dissimilar venue introducing more variety into their dining experiences (Etkin & Ratner, 2012]]; Etkin & Sela, 2016]]). Consistent with the prior results, in the joint (vs. solo) consumption condition, perceiving more (vs. less) future time ahead in the relationship increased preference for variety in joint consumption, and this was driven by value for excitement in the relationship.

Together, these findings suggest that not only can variety among means to relationship satisfaction influence positive feelings toward the relationship (Etkin & Berger, 2022]]) but variety can also be a goal in relationships. People seek variety in the activities they do together with their partner as a function of how much they value excitement as a means to satisfaction in the relationship.

#### Variety and Time of Day

Going beyond specific contexts that affect people’s preference for variety (e.g., Ariely & Levav, 2000]]; Etkin, 2016]]; Ratner & Kahn, 2002]]), Gullo et al. (2019)]] explore whether people are also more likely to pursue variety as a goal at certain times of day. Research on chronobiology finds that many internal biological processes systematically fluctuate throughout the day (Hastings et al., 2003]]; Hofstra & de Weerd, 2008]]). Such processes include those that produce physiological arousal or felt internal stimulation (Blake, 1967]]). In particular, arousal is lower in the morning and increases in a concave manner throughout the day (Kleitman, 1963]]; Thayer [^1978], [^1989]). Because variety is stimulating (Kahn, 1995]]; Raju, 1980]]) and choosing varied things feels stimulating and exciting (Etkin & Mogilner, 2016]]; Menon & Kahn, 1995]]), we hypothesized that variety-seeking would follow a similar circadian pattern: lower in the morning relative to the afternoon and evening.

To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the supermarket shopping behavior of over one million households during a 25-month period (Gullo et al., 2019]], Study 1). Our analysis focused on the variety purchased within a category for a given period and estimated a model with this variety score as the outcome and an hour-of-day dummy variable as the focal predictor of interest. As expected, variety-seeking increased throughout the day, sharply during the morning and at a declining rate during the afternoon and evening.

Next, in a controlled lab study (Gullo et al., 2019]], Study 2), we randomly assigned participants to come into the lab at different times of day and measured variety-seeking on a previously validated task (Levav & Zhu, 2009]]). We also measured physiological arousal by having a research assistant record participants’ body temperature. Consistent with the prior analysis, variety-seeking increased over the day: People chose less variety if they completed the survey in the morning versus afternoon or evening. Physiological arousal (body temperature) followed a similar pattern and mediated the effect of time of day on variety-seeking.

Subsequent studies examined additional times of day and moderation by individual differences in chronotype (i.e., circadian changes in arousal): People who tend to go to bed and wake up earlier (and have higher levels of physiological arousal in the morning; Baehr et al., 2000]]) seek more variety than other chronotypes do earlier in the day.

Together, these findings suggest that the pursuit of variety depends on both contextual and temporal cues that influence people’s interest in (or appetite for) excitement and stimulation. Variety can be conceptualized as both a goal and a means to managing one’s internal state.

### Conclusion

In pursuit of valued goals, people often make use of multiple means. To pursue a goal for physical fitness, people may exercise more frequently or more intensively; they may change their diet, buy wearable technologies, or purchase a standing desk. To pursue a goal for professional success, people may enroll in new classes, read business books, or create a LinkedIn account. Although some goals may be associated with a larger number of means and others with fewer means, nearly all goals have multiple means available for their pursuit (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]).

This chapter reviewed three streams of research on variety among means, that is, how the perceived degree of differentiation among multiple means to a goal shapes goal-related phenomena. The first stream focused on how variety among means shapes the mechanics of goal pursuit: motivation, perceptions of goal progress, and the formation of future expectations (Abreu et al., 2022]]; Etkin & Laran, 2019]]; Etkin & Ratner, [^2012], [^2013]). The second stream explored how variety among means to superordinate goals for happiness, identity continuity, and relationship satisfaction contribute to these subjective states (Etkin & Berger, 2022]]; Etkin & Mogilner, 2016]]; Rifkin & Etkin, 2019]]). The third stream considered variety among means as a goal itself and identified contextual factors that increase or decrease variety-seeking behavior (Etkin, 2016]]; Gullo et al., 2019]]).

Across topics, variety played an important role. Variety among means influenced goal-directed motivation and willingness to invest effort in one’s goal (Etkin & Ratner, [^2012], [^2013]). Freedom to choose from a variety of means influenced perceptions of goal progress (Etkin & Laran, 2019]]), and perceiving more variety among past instances of goal conflict shaped expectations of future goal attainment (Abreu et al., 2022]]). Variety among day-to-day activities influenced people’s happiness (Etkin & Mogilner, 2016]]), variety among self-expressive assortments affected perceptions of one’s identity, and variety among joint activities influenced how people felt about their relationships (Etkin & Berger, 2022]]). People are also more likely to seek variety as a goal when they more highly value excitement (Etkin, 2016]]) and at times of day when they are experiencing greater arousal (Gullo et al., 2019]]).

Looking forward, future research could explore how variety among means shapes means selection and substitution processes. For example, would variety affect the extent to which means are perceived as substitutes or as complements (e.g., Fishbach et al., 2006]])? Whether and how people switch among means in response to poor performance or failure of one means to advance the goal (see also Chapter 9]] in this volume)? Whether people prefer to pursue goals with a single means (e.g., get in better shape through more regular exercise) or with multiple means simultaneously (e.g., get in better shape by exercising more regularly and consuming fewer calories, together)? Future work could also explore the process of generating means to goal attainment (e.g., Han & Gershoff, 2019]]), including when (and why) people come up with more varied options as well as consequences of such means generation (e.g., Bayuk et al., 2010]]). Exploring these and related questions would further advance our understanding of equifinality in goal systems and underscore the critical role of variety among means in goal systemic phenomena.

Influencing Attitudes and Behavior

Birga Mareen Schumpe

This chapter connects goal systems theory (GST; Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2015]) with the literature on persuasion to provide a new framework for the understanding and development of attitude and behavior change strategies. Simply put, this chapter will answer the following question: How can we use the principles of GST to influence individuals’ choice and evaluation of means?

GST describes _goals_ as nodes that form specific network structures with their respective means for attainment (Kruglanski 1996a]], 1996b]]). A _means_ can represent a behavior, a consumer product, a person, an attitude, or a situation that facilitates goal pursuit (Kopetz et al., 2012]]). _Goal pursuit_, that is, whether individuals actually engage in a certain behavior to attain a goal, depends on several factors. Chief among them are the presence of goals and available means (see Figure 8.1]], the goal systematic approach to persuasion). A key premise in GST is the idea that behaviors are goal-driven, that they are means used to attain certain goals (e.g., Kruglanski, Jasko, et al., 2015). Thus, the fact that attitude and behavior change are goal-driven processes (Katz, 1960]]; Kruglanski et al., 2002]]) can be systematically used for persuasion purposes.

Figure 8.1 Schematic overview of the four persuasion strategies derived from goal systems theory: The goal systematic approach to persuasion.

In persuasion, the communicator usually intends for the recipient to adopt a certain attitude or to engage in a certain behavior. Based on the principles of GST, the most basic example would be that the persuader activates a goal and then suggests to the recipient a means that can be employed to attain that goal (which would then motivate the recipient to show the desired behavior). Indeed, it has been found that upon goal activation, corresponding means for goal attainment become activated (e.g., Aarts & Dijksterhuis, 2000]]; Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; Shah & Kruglanski, 2000]]), stirring individuals into action (Sheeran et al., 2006]]). Therefore, there is evidence that goal priming can increase the effectiveness of a persuasive message (e.g., Strahan et al., 2002]]).

However, in this chapter, I want to outline a more pronounced picture, including four distinct persuasive strategies (see Figure 8.1]]) derived from principles and research based on GST. A key premise of the goal systematic approach to persuasion is to alter the goal–means configuration in such a way that it increases the likelihood that a target means will be evaluated and selected as intended by the persuader. For instance, the persuader can make additional goals or means more salient, which alters the architecture of a given goal–means configuration in the decision maker’s mind. Specifically, the persuader can highlight additional goals that a means serves or instead point out that the means is actually harmful to some other goals that the recipient holds. Similarly, the persuader can present a target means among many alternative means that also fulfills the desired goal or juxtapose the target means to other means that are not helpful—and may even be detrimental—to the focal goal pursuit.

How goals and means are related (which entails the presence of goals and the availability of other means) has important self-regulatory consequences. This is due to the principles that govern goal systems, which also apply to cognitive associative networks (for overviews, see Fishbach & Ferguson, 2007]]; Kruglanski & Kopetz, 2009]]). For example, the strength of association between a means and a goal will be diluted when additional goal connections are added (cf. fan effect; Anderson, 1983]]; Anderson & Reder, 1999]]). Hence, the perceived goal–means configuration has important consequences for how individuals evaluate and select means and, ultimately, for the behavior people choose to engage in. Understanding the architecture of goal–means configurations, the interrelatedness of goals and means, and the principles that govern goal systems is crucial for improving our knowledge on persuasion.

The most basic goal–means configuration is _unifinality_, in which one means is instrumental for attaining one goal (see Figure 8.2]]). In the unifinal configuration, the strength of connection between the goal and the means is relatively high since no additional goals or means are present to dilute the relationship. The means is perceived as instrumental and is therefore likely chosen for goal pursuit.

Figure 8.2 Unifinality

For instance, when individuals “just want to get things done” (i.e., when they are in locomotion mode; Higgins et al., 2003]]; Kruglanski et al., 2000]]; Orehek et al., 2012]]), a unifinal means is a very attractive option. Of course, how instrumental a means is perceived to be is always relative.

In the following, I will present four different goal–means configurations beyond unifinality—corresponding to four basic persuasive scenarios (i.e., adding a positive goal connection, adding a negative goal connection, presenting an alternative means, presenting a detrimental means), discuss their implications for means’ evaluation and choice, and discuss how this can be systematically utilized to tailor influence strategies. I coin this the _goal systematic approach to persuasion_.

### Persuasive Interventions on Goal Level

#### Adding Positive Goal Connections: Multifinality

Multifinal goal–means configurations afford the concurrent attainment of co-activated goals (see Figure 8.3]]; Zhang et al., 2007]]). Or, simply put, they allow one to “have one’s cake and eat it too.” Multifinal means offer greater value than unifinal means (i.e., they allow one to achieve more goals at the same time), but this comes at the price of diluted instrumentality (Zhang et al., 2007]]). Given that the strength of an association between a goal and a means is interpreted as perceived instrumentality (Kruglanski, 1996b]]), multifinal means are perceived as less instrumental than their unifinal counterparts.

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-023-colour.gif)

Figure 8.3 Multifinality

For instance, toothpaste that claimed to prevent cavities was rated better at cavity prevention than toothpaste that claimed to prevent cavities as well as whiten teeth (Chernev, 2007]]). Thus, when considered as a persuasion strategy, highlighting additional benefits (e.g., emphasizing that an additional goal is being served by a product) is only recommended when the recipient holds the additional goal. Otherwise, the means’ instrumentality would be diluted without the benefit of providing any additional value for the recipient. This would explain why additional unwanted product features can lead to lower purchase intentions (Simonson et al., 1994]]) or why the pursuit of socially beneficial product enhancements can sometimes backfire (Newman et al., 2014]]).

Furthermore, it has been found that individual differences in self-regulatory mode are associated with means preference. People in assessment (vs. locomotion) mode usually prefer multifinal over unifinal means (Orehek et al., 2012]]). Thus, it seems sensible to match the advertised means to the target population. For instance, Italians are relatively high in locomotion, whereas Japanese are relatively high in assessment (Kruglanski et al., 2013]]). Therefore, in the marketing context, a multifunctional gadget might find greater appreciation on the Japanese market, whereas a more straightforward product with a single purpose could be better suited to Italian consumers. Firms should take these differences into account to create effective marketing campaigns in specific countries.

#### Adding Negative Goal Connections: Counterfinality

A persuader can also highlight negative aspects of a product or a behavior to influence people’s evaluation and selection of means. The concept of counterfinality (see Figure 8.4]]) explains why means that are not only instrumental to a focal goal but also detrimental to an individual’s alternative goal are evaluated as more effective (Schumpe, Bélanger, Dugas, et al., 2018).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-024-colour.gif)

Figure 8.4 Counterfinality

Incorporating negative product information can enhance the product’s perceived instrumentality and render attitudes toward the product more favorable (Schumpe, 2018]]). For instance, Schumpe, Bélanger, Dugas, et al. (2018) found that a product was rated as more effective when it was detrimental to an alternative goal (e.g., a mouthwash that causes a burning sensation).

In another study, Schumpe, Bélanger, Dugas, et al. (2018) recruited participants who got tattooed and asked them to indicate their most important goal for getting tattooed. Participants answered that they wanted to look more attractive, to rebel, or to remember certain life events. When asked whether getting tattooed was also detrimental to one of their other goal pursuits, participants listed that it hurt their professional career, caused physical pain, or made it more difficult to find a dating partner. The more detrimental getting tattooed was to an alternative goal pursuit, the more instrumental it was perceived for achieving the focal goal. This counterfinality effect is especially strong when the focal goal and the alternative goal are of great importance: The more important the alternative goal, the greater the costs to the individual when pursuing the focal goal. Hence, the magnitude of the focal goal must be high so that individuals are willing to incur these costs (Schumpe, Bélanger, Dugas, et al., 2018).

As a theoretical umbrella framework, counterfinality can summarize several lines of research, such as effort justification (i.e., items or outcomes are perceived as more valuable when acquired via great effort; Festinger, 1957]]; Labroo & Kim, 2009]]; for practical applications, see e.g., Koo & Fishbach, 2010]]; Norton et al., 2012]]), reactance (i.e., forbidden items and behaviors appear more desirable; Brehm, 1966]]), or cost heuristics (i.e., expensive items are perceived as more effective; Shiv et al., 2005]]). Overall then, means are perceived as highly instrumental when alternative goals are sacrificed (see also Bélanger et al., 2016]]).

The concept of counterfinality helps us understand why people keep engaging in harmful behaviors, and therefore informs intervention strategies. Contrary to the common notion that people continue engaging in harmful activities despite their negative consequences, it might be because of their negative consequences (see Chapter 2]] in this volume). In support of these notions, Schumpe (2022)]] found that students wanted to maintain unhealthy studying routines that entailed neglecting goals such as family, friends, and sports to study more intensely because they perceived these routines to be effective. Thus, the intuitive counseling strategy of pointing out to a client the negative consequences of their problematic behavior might backfire. Schumpe (2022)]] confirmed this idea with preliminary data: When the negative consequences of their actions were highlighted, willingness to self-sacrifice for their cause decreased only for people low in commitment, whereas it tended to increase for people who were highly committed to their cause. This insight can be used to help people disengage from harmful behaviors but also to create more satisfying consumption experiences.

### Persuasive Interventions on the Means Level

#### Providing Alternative Means: Equifinality

Goal pursuit and choice satisfaction also depend on the available means. The method of _providing alternative means_ (Schumpe, Bélanger, Giacomantonio, et al.., 2018; Schumpe et al., in press) is another attitude and behavior change strategy inspired by GST. Given that attitudes and behaviors serve important psychological goals (e.g., getting social approval, obtaining a desirable self-image; Katz, 1960]]; Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; Sarnoff & Katz, 1954]]), people feel reactance (Brehm, 1966]]) when their attitudinal or behavioral freedom is threatened. Hence, instead of doing what is asked of them, individuals often do the exact opposite or adopt an attitudinal position that is in stark contrast to the intent of the persuasive message (Brehm, 1966]]; Dillard & Shen, 2005]]). However, a persuasive attempt is more likely to succeed when accompanied by an alternative means to the same goal (e.g., a substitute product or behavior), which affords recipients the opportunity to still attain their goal.

GST provides a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon. In the equifinal goal–means configuration (Figure 8.5]]; Kruglanski et al., 2011]]), a goal can be attained by several means which serve as substitutes for each other. The more means are connected to one single goal, the lower the perceived instrumentality of each single means (Bélanger et al., 2015]]).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-025-colour.gif)

Figure 8.5 Equifinality

This principle can be used for creating persuasive messages. Schumpe, Bélanger, Giacomantinio, et al. (2018) found that providing peaceful alternative means to attain participants’ political goals reduced their support for other violent means (see also Chapter 11]] in this volume). In line with predictions from GST (i.e., the more means are attached to a goal, the weaker the single connections), this effect was mediated by lower perceived instrumentality of the violent means.

Research has shown that political violence is also geared toward psychological goals such as significance or excitement (Dugas et al., 2015]]; Kruglanski et al., 2009]]; Schumpe, Bélanger, Moyano, & Nisa, 2018]]). Schumpe, Bélanger, Moyano, and Nisa (2018)]] found that asking people to write about their legacy (i.e., something to pass on to make a meaningful, long-lasting contribution) decreased their search for meaning and, consequently, their support for violence. Similarly, support for a violent activist group could be decreased when participants were presented with a peaceful alternative that was able to fulfill their quest for excitement: Schumpe, Bélanger, Moyano, and Nisa (2018)]] presented participants with either a peaceful but boring activist group (formal statements, sit-downs, etc.) or an exciting peaceful activist group (marches and parades, humorous skits and pranks, etc.). Individuals high in sensation-seeking generally liked the violent group because it provided greater excitement. However, when presented with a peaceful alternative that was able to satiate their quest for adventure, the support for the violent group could be reduced. Although numerous research studies described here have been conducted in the context of political violence or deradicalization (for an overview on GST and the political domain, see Chapter 12]] in this volume), the underlying principles hold to any subject area.

In the context of consumer research, Schumpe et al. (2020)]] used different products to demonstrate the _reactance decoy effect_. In general, people do not like to be influenced or limited in their freedom of choice. Accordingly, recipients show psychological reactance (Brehm, 1966]]) as a response to persuasive messages such as advertisements (Clee & Wicklund, 1980]]). However, this response can be attenuated by the inclusion of a _reactance decoy_ (Schumpe et al., 2020]]). A reactance decoy is a persuasive message presented before a target message that includes an opportunity for the recipient to express their attitude toward the decoy object. The attitude expression gives recipients the opportunity to re-establish their threatened freedom. Expressing their attitude toward the decoy or “venting” reduced reactance toward the subsequently presented target message and positively impacted participants’ evaluation of the target object (Schumpe et al., 2020]]). The reactance decoy functions as an alternative means for recipients to reach the goal of reasserting their attitudinal freedom. Thus, its presentation had a significant impact on participants’ actual behavior, such as willingness to forego payment for a chance to win the target product (Schumpe et al., 2020]]).

In another context, Bélanger et al. (2021)]] showed that self-affirmation (Steele, 1988]]) was effective for changing attitudes. When recipients of a persuasive message were presented with an alternative means to secure their feeling of self-worth, they could be more easily convinced to change their opinions (this is because, partially, people uphold strong attitudes for ego-enhancement purposes). This concurs with Leander and Chartrand (2017)]], who found that goal-thwarted individuals only resort to displaced aggression when they lack other means to effectively interact with their environment (for a similar discussion of ideas, see Chapter 9]] in this volume). Conceptually, their findings show that teaching a new strategy to deal with displaced aggression could be considered as presenting an alternative means (i.e., an alternative way to efficiently interact with one’s environment). Similarly, people’s willingness to self-sacrifice under conditions of mortality salience could be reduced when alternative ways to symbolic immortality were provided (Routledge & Arndt, 2008]]). This shows that self-sacrifice was merely a means of finding meaning and reducing the fear of death. Following the outlined logic, when an alternative means was present, people did not need to resort to drastic measures such as self-sacrifice. There are plenty of other examples demonstrating the effectiveness of presenting individuals with an alternative means to change their attitudes and behaviors in a desired direction. From clinical psychology, we know that self-harm can be reduced by providing functionally equivalent sensory stimulation (Carr, 1977]]; Favell et al., 1982]]). For example, bright and colorful toys can reduce eye-poking and mouthing rubber toys can reduce pica. These basic principles of behavior change were already supported by early research by Skinner ([^1938], [^1953]), who found that it is more effective to reinforce alternative behaviors than it is to punish unwanted behaviors.

In short, a fundamental ingredient for a successful persuasive intervention is to present the recipient with an alternative (substitute) means to attain their desired goal. As a caveat, however, the persuader needs to be careful not to present too many alternative means. When recipients are presented with too many options to choose from (i.e., too many available means for goal attainment), they perceive each option as less attractive and might end up being less satisfied with their choice (e.g., Botti & Iyengar, 2006]]; Iyengar & Lepper 2000]]). Having too many available means can also lead to reduced goal commitment (Bélanger et al., 2015]]; Kruglanski et al., 2011]]).

#### Providing Contrasting Means: Contrafinality

The goal systematic approach to persuasion (see Figure 8.1]]) is completed by its last configuration, dubbed _contrafinality_ (Figure 8.6]]). The concept of contrafinality is a new theoretical framework that is being first introduced here in this chapter. The idea is that, similar to adding negative goal connections, we can also imagine adding a negative or detrimental means to the unifinal goal–means configuration. This would result in a means instrumental for achieving a respective goal juxtaposed to a means detrimental for achieving the same goal (see Figure 8.6]]).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-026-colour.gif)

Figure 8.6 Contrafinality

I propose the contrafinal goal–means configuration as a theoretical umbrella framework to explain contrast effects (Brickman et al., 1978]]; Kenrick, & Gutierres, 1980]]; Pepitone & DiNubile, 1976]]; Sherif & Hovland, 1961]]; Sherif et al., 1958]]). Akin to the logic of counterfinality (where the linkage to a detrimental goal allows for a stronger link between a means to a focal goal; Schumpe, Bélanger, Dugas, et al., 2018), adding a detrimental means would allow for a stronger relationship between a means and the focal goal, resulting in greater perceived instrumentality of the means to the goal (Kruglanski, Chernikova, et al., 2015; Schumpe, Bélanger, Dugas, et al., 2018). This is based on GST’s assumption that the perceived instrumentality of a means to a goal is bound by a constant sum principle (Kruglanski, Chernikova, et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2007]]).

A classic example of a contrast effect is the following: A lower-priced item such as a $20 T-shirt appears to be a better deal when juxtaposed to a sweater that costs $200. Thus, the more detrimental (i.e., expensive) one means, the more instrumental (i.e., better deal) the other one appears to be. Another example is the study by Kenrick and Gutierres (1980)]]: Male participants rated an average-looking female target person as less attractive when they had watched _Charlie’s Angels_ beforehand. Dating can be considered as a means to fulfill one’s romantic relationship goals. How instrumental or attractive someone is perceived to be depends, of course, on a variety of factors but certainly also on whether or not other “means” are available and how attractive these are. Here, the prettier women on TV (e.g., _Charlie’s Angels_) lead to a lower attractiveness rating of the female target person.

This contrafinality (or contrast) effect might be moderated by goal magnitude. In the examples mentioned, this could be the importance of saving money or of physical attractiveness in dating. Research by Beaureguard and Dunning (1998) lends support to this notion: Contrast effects were more pronounced after individuals’ self-esteem had been threatened but could be reduced when individuals’ self-esteem was bolstered. In the study by Beaureguard and Dunning (1998), low versus high self-esteem can be seen as a proxy for goal magnitude, reflecting different levels of importance of the goal of feeling good about oneself.

Overall, communicators with a persuasive intention are well advised to always take into account the availability of other “means” and how they compare to the one they are trying to “sell.” Thereby, the recipient’s decision-making context can be tailored favorably (without the expectation that the detrimental means will actually be engaged). The most straightforward example is the one outlined above, in which the target means (e.g., a product or service being sold) is contrasted with a more detrimental means so that the target looks better in comparison, due to its increased instrumentality perception. Moreover, the following persuasion scenarios are imaginable (Figure 8.7a]], ruling out competitors; Figure 8.7b]], attenuating negative impact).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-027-colour.gif)

Figure 8.7 (a) Ruling out competitors. (b) Attenuating negative impact.

Figure 8.7a]] depicts a situation in which a persuader tries to hide the superior (instrumental) means from the recipient. If the decision maker was to become aware of the more superior (instrumental) means, GST would predict that the means the persuader is trying to “sell” would be perceived as more detrimental. Figure 8.7b]] shows an “equifinal detrimental means,” where the perceived detrimentality of a means is expected to be attenuated by juxtaposing it with another detrimental means. For instance, this could be helpful in a situation in which the negative impact of harmful information needs to be mitigated.

It is important to note that these ideas still need to be subjected to empirical scrutiny. However, GST has a vast potential to not only explain contrast effects but also predict the occurrence of other social influence phenomena. Ultimately, this knowledge can be used to systematically tailor effective influence attempts.

### Future Directions

Several lines of research could benefit from being revisited from a goal systematic perspective. Similar to the aforementioned ideas about contrast effects, it would be interesting to explore if and how assimilation effects fit into the GST narrative. Whereas contrast effects represent judgmental movement away from an anchoring stimulus, assimilation is understood as movement toward an anchoring stimulus (Mussweiler, 2003]]; Petty & Cacioppo, 1996]]; Sherif & Hovland, 1961]]; Sherif et al., 1958]]). Thus, for assimilation, juxtaposition to another instrumental means would result in a more positive judgment of the target means, whereas juxtaposition to a detrimental means should result in a more negative judgment of the target means. Existing theoretical models predict that assimilation occurs when the anchoring stimulus is seen as belonging to a certain category and, therefore, used in forming a representation of the target (instead of being used to form a representation of the standard, as is the case for contrast effects; Bless & Schwarz, 2010]]). Future theoretical and empirical work should explore the conditions under which assimilation and contrast effects occur and how this fits into GST. Relevant factors could include (a) order of presentation (i.e., whether the instrumental or detrimental means is presented first) and (b) a goal(s) currently activated in the decision maker’s mind (which likely also depends on the order of presentation in cases where stimuli are not presented simultaneously).

This links to another line of research on decision-making that is of interest to be reviewed from the GST perspective, that is, joint versus separate evaluation (Bazerman et al., 1999]]; Hsee et al., 1999]]). One major objective is to explain preference reversals in joint versus separate evaluations (Bazerman et al., 1999]]; Hsee et al., 1999]]). For instance, Nowlis and Simonson (1997)]] demonstrated a shift in preference between price and number of features. In their experiment, price was more important in the joint evaluation conditions, whereas purchase intentions were driven by the number of features in the separate condition. Similarly, when rating various consumer products, price became more important in joint evaluation mode, but brand names were more influential in a separate evaluation (Nowlis & Simonson, 1997]]). Likewise, Kahneman and Ritov (1994)]] demonstrated the same preference shifts for various types of environmental and social issues. In joint evaluation, participants showed a preference to support human causes such as skin cancer, multiple myeloma, and lead-based paint. However, in separate evaluations, they leaned toward “attractive” causes such as spotted owls, coral reefs, and toxic spills. From a GST perspective, it seems very likely that inconsistencies in decision-making arise due to temporary shifts in preferences caused by goals becoming more or less important, depending on the context or circumstances an individual is currently in (e.g., social impression management goals, sense of justice).

Most importantly, merging GST with the attitude change literature can inspire new insights into topics such as attitude change or attitude ambivalence. For instance, could lateral attitude change be a by-product of _goal shielding_ (i.e., the activation of a goal inhibiting alternative goals; Shah et al., 2002]])? Revisiting the persuasion literature from the lens of goal systems and reinterpreting attitudes as means interconnected within goal systems could answer these and related questions. Previously discussed concepts, such as adding consonant or removing dissonant cognitions to reduce cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957]]), could be interpreted as making positive goal connections salient by respectively suppressing alternative goal pursuits. Ambivalent attitudes, characterized by both strong positive and negative reactions toward the same object, could be viewed as means serving one goal, while at the same time being detrimental to another goal. Thereby, GST can inspire new ideas to harness the power of attitudes with extreme positive and negative components to shape individuals’ attitudes and behaviors in a desired direction. This line of thought paves the way for a renewed perspective and improved understanding of social influence techniques.

### Conclusion

The goal systematic approach to persuasion can be understood as a form of choice architecture or landscaping for decision-making (i.e., adding a positive or negative goal connection, presenting alternative or detrimental means). For example, manipulating whether decision makers see costs as a means or as a goal influences their willingness to pay (see Chapter 6]] in this volume). By strategically using goal architecture to modify means’ perception, and thus their selection, a persuader can steer individuals’ behaviors in a desired direction.

This chapter introduced the goal systematic approach to persuasion. Four distinct persuasive strategies were presented that can be used to alter the goal–means architecture in a decision maker’s mind to influence means’ evaluation. On the goal level, additional goals can be made salient. For instance, a persuader can point out that additional goals the recipient holds are being served or harmed by the target means. On the means level, a persuader can shape the decision context favorably. Persuasive attempts are more successful when accompanied by a substitute means that allows the recipient to still fulfill their needs. For instance, reactance as a response to influence attempts can be reduced when recipients are presented with an alternative means to reassert their attitudinal freedom. Lastly, juxtaposition to a more detrimental means can increase a target means’ perceived instrumentality. To end with, studying persuasion from a goal systematic perspective offers a rich theoretical framework with broad opportunities for practical applications. Understanding the complex interplay between goals and means furthers our ability to influence people’s attitudes and behaviors. It is my hope that the goal systematic approach to persuasion can inspire a new stream of research and connect two important lines of social psychological literature that have hitherto been studied in isolation.

Means-Shifts, Domain Jumps, and Leaps of Faith

L. Maxim Laurijssen and N. Pontus Leander

The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting.

—Marcus Aurelius, _Meditations 5.20_

Life will not be contained. . . . Life, uh, finds a way.”

—Jeff Goldblum, _Jurassic Park_

How far will people go to fulfill their needs? Since Zeigarnik (1927)]] observed that people show better recall for unfinished tasks, a history of research has considered how thwarted goals and unmet needs remain active in the mind, guiding the individual to find viable alternative means to fulfillment (e.g., Bargh et al., 2008]]; Leander & Chartrand, 2017]]; Masicampo & Baumeister, 2011]]; White, 1959]]). In this chapter, we consider how goal systems theory (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]) offers a framework to propose at least three ways people seek alternative means to fulfill their needs: shifts between means within a current goal domain, jumps to other domains, and leaps of faith into unexpected or new directions. We refer to this as the _shifts–jumps–leaps_ (SJL) perspective of means substitution.

The network approach to self-regulation in goal systems theory highlights the importance of goal–means associations that provide the basis for shifts, jumps, and leaps. People’s goals and means form an associative _goal network_, organized in hierarchical _goal trees_, that are nested or embedded within different domains (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]). Domains are general categories of interconnected content; domains could differ by psychological content, as in the case of different social identities (Deaux, 1993]]), or emerge from real-world contexts, such as work life versus personal life (Hirschi et al., 2019]]; Shah & Kruglanski, 2008]]). Any single domain can host multiple, thematically related goal trees. Needs sit atop goal trees and domains, potentially connecting them (Kruglanski et al., 2002]], 2021).

Research has mostly focused on shifts between means and (sub)goals within a single domain (cf. Kruglanski, Chernikova, et al., 2015). For example, an employee may try to switch jobs when the current job does not fulfill their achievement needs. However, such a basic means-shift may not suffice if, for instance, the person lacks key skills or affordances, or if they already switched jobs and nothing improved. Need fulfillment may require shifting to other domains, or realms of behavior, because different domains afford distinct goal-directed behaviors (Gibson, 1979]]; Kruglanski et al., 2014]]; Milyavska et al., 2009; Sheldon & Hilpert, 2012]]). Instead of pursuing achievement in the work domain, the person could jump to some alternative domain associated with achievement, such as sports, hobbies, or social engagement.

These _jumps_—shifts to alternative domains—are facilitated by an interconnected need, which acts as a “hub” that allows one to cognitively shift upward, to the level of the unfulfilled need, to gain access to other goal trees and domains (Kruglanski et al., 2002]], 2021). Whereas basic means-shifts involve smaller moves, within a goal tree or domain, jumps involve grander moves across one or multiple interconnected points in the goal network.

Yet even jumps may not be fulfilling. Perhaps the person is not good at sports, or a new hobby is less fulfilling than anticipated, or one’s entire goal network has lost instrumentality. We theorize that people may engage in more drastic, enigmatic shifts, or _leaps_, which involve looking beyond the boundaries of their goal network in search of new means and affordances. A motivational readiness to leap could help to sustain motivation under uncertainty, and the search could incorporate one’s broader cognitive network as well as external inputs. For instance, a person with an unfulfilled need for achievement may surge toward novel pursuits that offer appealing alternative definitions of achievement (e.g., to “achieve” enlightenment), or they may be influenced by demagogues to pursue achievement through radical action and extremism (see Chapter 11]] in this volume). Leaps may occur without planning and need not be logically coherent; the association between any given pursuit and need fulfillment could be merely heuristic, even illusory (e.g., Leander et al., 2017]]). Even if valid, the associative linkage may be indirect and implicit, requiring a leap of faith to act on it.

In this chapter, we reflect on the limited instrumentality of basic means-shifts to illustrate why jumps and leaps can be useful or necessary. We then outline the structures and processes relevant to the SJL perspective and provide examples of these mechanisms. We also generalize shifts, jumps, and leaps to a wide range of phenomena in psychology as seemingly small and innocuous changes in people’s self-regulation may exert grander and sprawling effects (e.g., Pothos & Busemeyer, 2022]]). We conclude with implications for goal systems theory and motivation science generally.

### Basic Means-Shifts

Basic means-shifts allow people to change their approach to a goal when a current means is no longer instrumental or available (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; Kruglanski, Chernikova, et al., 2015). Imagine a person who typically walks to work but has injured their foot. The change in circumstance might thwart the person’s goal to get to work; alternatively, they could shift to another means of transportation, such as driving or public transport.

Means-shifts follow basic cognitive principles of associative networks (cf. Baronchelli et al., 2013]]). One principle is that the shift must occur via _associations_—that is, between means and goals that are cognitively interconnected, as well as cognitively available and accessible (Hobfoll, 1989]]; Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2014]). An association could be direct but also indirect through a path of interconnected goals and means. Hence, when confronted with obstacles and constraints, people may shift between interconnected means and (sub)goals until they find one that works. Kelly and Updegraff (2017)]] observed that means-shifts are especially likely when goals are thwarted. In their study, college students with the goal of physical activity were asked to report multiple activities they would engage in to attain that goal, including current activities and alternatives. Self-reported engagement in any given alternative activity was higher when their current activity was unavailable, suggesting the generality (and flexibility) of means-shifts.

Another principle is that the total activation strength of an associative network generally remains a constant sum. A goal tree must sustain a constant level of motivational activation, roughly equivalent to the strength of the person’s need (Kruglanski et al., 2002]], 2021), which gets shared or subdivided across the various connections in the network. A network of associations between goals and means is analogous to a hydraulic system of pressure: If there are multiple means connected to a goal, any increase in association strength between one means and the goal requires a hydraulic weakening of association strengths between the other means associated with the goal (Shah & Kruglanski, 2008]]; see also Anderson, 1983]]). A consequence of this constant sum principle is that a network with a higher quantity of interconnected goals and means does not offer any more motivating potential than one with fewer interconnections.

#### Limits to Basic Means-Shifts

The instrumentality of basic means-shifts is constrained by the inherent shortcomings of making small moves within a single goal tree or domain. A means-shift is impossible if one has run out of available and accessible alternatives. Even if one has multiple means available, the constant sum principle implies that having a larger means set weakens the activation strength of any single means in the set (_dilution effects_; Anderson, 1983]]; Bélanger et al., 2015]]; Kruglanski, Gelfand, et al. 2015; Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2011]; Zhang et al., 2007]]). This may create efficiency losses in goal pursuit: In one experiment, participants were asked to list multiple means (vs. only one means) to pursue two otherwise independent work goals; they subsequently rated each goal and each listed means on various dimensions. The results indicated that, although listing a larger means set predicted higher commitment to the superordinate goal, it predicted lower commitment and engagement with the means themselves (Kruglanski et al., 2011]]).

Basic means-shifts are also constrained by the accessibility of other goals. Motivational conflicts arise when an alternative means has unwanted costs or consequences for other goals in the system. For example, a person may want to switch jobs, but hesitate, if it conflicts with the pursuit of desired social relationships. Shifting between means and subgoals also costs energy, effort, and other psychological or material resources that may sap motivation: A person may successfully shift to another job but have little energy left to pursue their original achievement goal after dealing with job applications, interviews, relocation, and adjustment to the new conditions. Furthermore, people prefer and prioritize means that facilitate multiple goals, to the exclusion of means that do not (_multifinality constraints effect_). In one experiment, Köpetz and colleagues (2011) asked participants around lunchtime whether they were hungry. The majority reported being hungry, so “getting lunch” was the focal goal. For the manipulation of multiple goals, participants were asked either about goals they had yet to attain (so multiple goals were activated, in addition to “getting lunch”) or about goals they had already attained (so only “getting lunch” was active). Participants were then asked to select one or multiple foods that were either easy or difficult to obtain. The results indicated that when multiple unattained goals were activated, participants limited their preferences to the most easily obtainable foods—raising questions about whether the lunch would be satisfying.

Basic means-shifts can also be unfulfilling (or ‘too little, too late’), if the broader goal tree or domain becomes contaminated by failure or conflict. People are averse to pursuits that have failed them in the past (Jones et al., 2009]]). Repeated failure in a goal tree or domain may lower its perceived instrumentality, as indicated by increased boredom, depletion, and/or disengagement (Ryan et al., 1995]]; Westgate & Wilson 2018]]; Wolff & Martarelli, 2020]]). In this vein, Park et al. (2007)]] observed that people disengage from their need to be perceived as effective, in an academic domain, after repeatedly suffering failures in that domain. Furthermore, even if a means’ instrumentality is fully restored, self-evaluation concerns may lead some people—such as those with perfectionistic or narcissistic tendencies (e.g., Sedikides et al., 2019]])—to avoid pursuits that remind them of past failures and thus threaten their self-perceptions.

Ultimately, basic means-shifts may be unfulfilling if the higher goal or domain lacks instrumentality. There could be constraints on the level of need fulfillment afforded by a situation (e.g., Lau & Wenzel, 2015]]; Radel et al., 2011]]) or changes in people’s wants, needs, and standards (e.g., Bühler et al., 2019]]; Shah & Kruglanski, 2008]]; Wehner et al., 2021]]). Some people adopt externally imposed goals that do not fit their needs in the first place (Kuhl & Kazén, 1994]]).

Taken together, means-shifts may not suffice, raising the question of whether there are other fulfillment mechanisms. One could pause goal pursuit and wait for conditions to improve (Bargh et al., 2001]]; Shah et al., 2009]]). However, people may be unable or unwilling to wait (Kruglanski et al., 2014]]) and may prefer to shift to another domain or realm of behavior.

### Jumping to Other Motivational Domains

People may search for alternative domains or realms of behavior in which to pursue fulfillment. Jumps are shifts between goal trees, often across domains. Rather than a simple or lateral means-shift within a goal tree or domain, a jump entails vertical movement, up to the level of the unfulfilled need that connects to other domains. In effect, needs act as associative hubs, or bridge nodes, that afford “jumping” across the goal network—from a current goal in one domain to another goal in a disconnected domain (Kruglanski et al., 2002]], 2021). Figure 9.1]] illustrates a jump (Panel B), in comparison to a basic means-shift (Panel A).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-028.gif)

Figure 9.1 A shifts–jumps–leaps perspective of means substitution. In Panel A (Shift) and Panel B (Jump), the interconnected nodes represent goal trees (goal–means hierarchies), nested in two different domains associated with the same need. In Panel C (Leap), a need is associated with three domains, all nested in a goal network, which is nested in a cognitive network. The nodes in the cognitive network represent content that is associated with the need but not part of the goal network.

The idea of domain jumps was initially suggested in theorizing on frustration–aggression (Leander & Chartrand, 2017]]). This line of research showed that people jump to the psychological domain of aggressive behavior to maintain or restore efficacy or control when a focal domain of achievement is thwarted. After goal frustration, aggressive impulses often get displaced onto targets that had no role in the original frustration (Berkowitz, 1989]]; Dollard et al., 1939]]). In five experiments, Leander and Chartrand (2017)]] observed that such displaced aggression operated much like any other means-shift: In response to thwarted goals, having a means to engage in displaced aggression helped to maintain or restore self-efficacy beliefs. The displaced aggression was attenuated among participants who were experimentally presented with alternative means, such as a second opportunity for goal pursuit in the thwarted goal domain, or an opportunity to have a greater impact by helping someone. The priority was to (re-)assert one’s efficacy, regardless of whether it meant jumping between the domains of achievement striving, aggression, or helping others (see also Leander et al., 2020]]).

A history of research showed that people pursue multiple goals, across life domains, to maximize their opportunities for need fulfillment (Hennecke & Freund, 2017]]; Hofer & Peetsma, 2005]]; Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; Milyavska et al., 2009; Shah & Kruglanski 2008]]; Sheldon & Hilpert, 2012]]; Sun & Frese, 2013]]). Our theorizing on jumps is rooted in the idea that any given want or need can be served by different goals from different domains (work, school, relationships, identities, groups, value systems, etc.), and that any given domain will contain goals befitting the constraints and affordances of that domain (Kruglanski et al., 2014]]). The higher need connects the disparate domains and allows for jumps between them (e.g., Baronchelli et al., 2013]]; Bullmore & Sporns, 2009]]; Watts & Strogatz, 1998]]). We will discuss structural and process considerations and illustrate how theorizing on domain jumps increases the generalizability of goal systems theory.

#### Shifting Upward, to the Need Level

Jumps operate by the same process as basic means-shifts, just at a higher hierarchical level (i.e., at the superordinate need level rather than the subordinate goal level). Jumps should otherwise abide by the same cognitive network principles as basic means-shifts, such as association strength and constant sum. With regard to associations, a jump requires that instrumental, alternative domains are connected to the same need. For example, a person needing to relax might set a goal to take a vacation. Within the travel domain, they could shift between specific goals (beach vs. city vacation) and means of transportation (air vs. ground). Yet, these shifts all occur within the domain of travel. If travel was obstructed—as during the COVID-19 pandemic—need fulfillment may necessitate a shift “upward,” out of the travel domain, to find alternative domains associated with relaxation (e.g., outdoor activities or in-home entertainment). Although the new goals, means, and behaviors are unrelated to travel, they serve the same need.

In line with the constant sum principle, the association strength between a domain and a need should weaken when that domain is no longer sufficiently instrumental to the fulfillment of the need. In turn, other domains associated with that need should hydraulically gain strength. If needs operate as hubs, people may jump from a now weakened domain (i.e., former goal or means) to a new goal or means nested in a domain that gained strength.

Although this process is seen from a top-down, need-driven perspective of alternative goals in other domains, jumps could also occur from a bottom-up activation of alternative goal trees associated with a multifinal means, such as money, which serves multiple goals across domains (e.g., Mandel et al., 2017]]; Richins, 2017]]). Hence, the activation of certain means or goals can increase the accessibility of alternative domains. In any case, this jump to another goal tree in another domain is driven by the weakening of goals in one domain and the strengthening of goals in another.

Jumps implicate additional principles that may cause meaningful, albeit secondary, psychological changes. With regard to associative networks (e.g., Baronchelli et al., 2013]]), jumps can substantially alter the focal starting point for _spreading activation_ (e.g., Collins & Loftus, 1975]]). That is, a jump to a new focal goal, elsewhere in the goal network, may be accompanied by the activation or priming of qualitatively distinct content associated with the new domain. If a goal system is analogous to a cognitive-motivational “map” of interconnected constructs, shifting to a new goal or domain would involve a repositioning of focal attention to another location on the map. Much as a change of environments could prime goals and means (Kruglanski, Chernikova, et al., 2015; Shah & Kruglanski, 2000]]), changes in one’s psychological “environment” would prime cognitive constructs proximally associated with the new focal goal and the domain in which it is nested. Hence, jumping across the goal network may precipitate broad changes in one’s psychological states, self-concepts, and identities and include a reprioritization of values that alters the trajectory of future shifts and jumps. From a complex systems perspective, local changes lead to chaotic, turbulent, and non-linear effects in the system at large (Fieguth, 2021]]; Jordan et al., 2015]]; Pothos & Busemeyer, 2022]]; Shah & Kruglanski, 2008]]). In that way, a change in goals could change the person.

#### Examples of Domain Jumps

The idea that jumps are regulated by a common, superordinate need could explain the seemingly dissociated or displaced responses to threat and frustration that pervade the psychological literature. Toward this end, recent theorizing on _frustration–affirmation_ applied goal systems theory to integrate multiple lines of research that examine shifts between content domains to address a psychological need, including frustration–aggression and self-affirmation (Leander et al., 2020]]).

The gist is that some domains may be socially acquired, whereas other domains may be ancient and biologically inherited. For example, the need for achievement can be pursued across one’s professional, personal, or social life domain. Some definitions of _achievement_ are socially constructed and can vary by the norms and values of one’s social network (e.g., Kruglanski, Gelfand, et al., 2015). In an experiment conducted during the 2016 European migrant crisis, Dutch adults who were embedded in a social network of volunteers did not show aggression in response to a work-related failure; rather, they reported an increased willingness to volunteer in refugee support activities (cf. Leander et al., 2020]]). Among these participants, the volunteering domain was an alternative means through which achievement could be pursued.

With regard to a human tendency to resort to violence, people might prefer prosocial domains but ultimately prioritize the fulfillment of the superordinate need. In certain cultures, social norms might even reinforce the use of violence, such as when men alternate between the social identity domains of being a worker and a warrior. In one study, male American handgun owners reported their expectation that they would lose their job in the next 12 months and reported their agreement with proviolent values within masculinity ideology (e.g., “A man should not be afraid to fight”). Participants then completed a shooting simulation task in which they were instructed to quickly “shoot” armed targets and not shoot unarmed targets. Expectations of job loss interacted with masculinity ideology to predict a greater proportion of shooting errors against unarmed targets (Leander et al., 2020]]). To them, violence was a socially normative, alternative domain to assert masculine dominance.

Altogether, people may jump to seemingly disconnected domains, which could explain violent as well as beneficent responses to frustration. Hence, domain jumps could explain how seemingly (self-)destructive tendencies could reflect active and ongoing self-regulation (Kopetz & Orehek, 2015]]; see Chapter 2]] in this volume).

#### Limits to Domain Jumps

The shortcomings of domain jumps can be similar to basic means-shifts, but their consequences may be more severe. People expend cognitive resources when they change domains (Gollwitzer et al., 1990]]; Gollwitzer & Oettingen, 2016]]; Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006]]; Louro et al., 2007]]; Sun & Frese, 2013]]), and domain jumps could be uniquely depleting (e.g., Kruglanski, Chernikova, et al. 2015; Kruglanski, Gelfand, et al. 2015; Kruglanski et al., 2011]]; Shah & Kruglanski, 2002]]). The switching costs increase when a jump prompts secondary psychological changes. There can be efficiency losses if the new goal requires secondary psychological changes to take effect before the goal can be effectively pursued. Jumping domains could result in a costly period of reduced effectiveness in the new domain—or a failure to launch in the first place and getting stuck in a rut, drained of resources.

Jumps may also be susceptible to motivational conflict at multiple levels—between specific means and goals, or between the broader domains in which goal trees are nested. Although the new domain may facilitate the fulfillment of a focal need, the breadth of content nested in any new domain introduces multiple potential points of conflict with other goals and needs, especially if one cannot construct a coherent narrative to reconcile the conflict(s). When a broader domain becomes associated with failure, it may contaminate the content within that domain. People might have certain qualitative preferences that limit the domains they want to jump to—norms, standards, identities, and self-_resources/books//Goal Systems Theory_ Psychological Process - Arie W. Kruglanski. Perhaps people intuitively anticipate the secondary changes that correspond with jumps and thus only want to make smaller jumps, to domains that sustain the activation of a preferred self-concept. In other words, there may be a preferred hierarchy of domains people rotate between (Shah et al., 2009]]), above and beyond any goals–means hierarchies within each domain. Such domain-level hierarchies could prevent people from jumping to more optimal goals that are nested in undesirable domains.

Ultimately, domains are abstract, general categories, so they may be limited in number; and it may be difficult to add new domains to a current goal network. If people can only jump to domains that are cognitively available and accessible, this may lead to the tyranny of the familiar, where people, for instance, keep going back and forth between old jobs or relationships, chasing ghosts of the past. If domains are cognitive categories that can be mentally represented, people may intuitively realize when they should jump and experience failures at multiple levels when they hesitate, or inhibit themselves, from jumping. Perhaps there is yet another mechanism that people may resort to when neither basic means-shifts nor domain jumps suffice.

### Leaping Beyond the Current Goal Network

When an entire goal network lacks instrumentality, people may search for alternatives via external inputs or their broader cognitive network. A _leap_ is a process in which one identifies a potential goal or means outside one’s goal network and surges toward it.

A defining feature of leaps is that people do not need to have prior experience with the target goal or means; its instrumentality can be merely assumed. With shifts or jumps, people act upon content that is already in their goal network; with leaps, people may shift toward content that is unstructured and based on guesswork—requiring people to trust their intuitions and hope for the best. Therefore, leaps can seem illogical; people can leap to dubious alternatives that are only intuitively or indirectly associated with need fulfillment. For example, a person who lacks real-world control may seek psychological control through belief in a higher power (Landau et al., 2015]]), or a person unable to achieve significance through normative channels can surge toward extremism (see Chapter 11]] in this volume).

Although a leap is purely conjectural, goal systems theory provides a basis to consider its mechanisms—which might include a broadening of attentional scope or openness to unorthodox means, spontaneous creation of new goal–means linkages and network structures, or surging to novel ideas and radical action.

#### A Broad Search for New Affordances

People who are motivationally ready for a leap may be more influenced by incidental inputs, be they spontaneous thoughts or situational cues. According to ancient history, Archimedes was obstructed in his goal to measure the volume of irregularly shaped objects. Later, when he stepped into a bath, he noticed the water level rise and had the sudden insight that the volume of objects could be measured by their displacement of liquid. (Archimedes then shouted “Eureka!” and ran naked in the streets, eager to share the discovery.) The events leading up to his eureka moment describe the prototypical conditions for a leap.

A leap can also be triggered by inputs from one’s cognitive network (see Figure 9.1]], Panel C). This requires a structural assumption that a goal network is itself nested within a wider cognitive network that contains other knowledge or constructs not currently relevant to the goal network (cf. Baronchelli et al., 2013]]; Kruglanski et al., 2002]]). The cognitive network could contain, for instance, knowledge about other types of goals and means that are not part of one’s current goal network. The distinction between motivational and non-motivational cognitive content is reminiscent of Devine’s (1989)]] distinction between stereotype knowledge and stereotype application—that is, people can learn about goals and means through cultural learning, but this does not necessarily mean that they incorporate them all into their goal network. A goal network is the part of a cognitive network perceived to be instrumental to need fulfillment; the rest of the cognitive network need not inform one’s pursuits but could be available for later use.

The process of leaps shares some similarities with basic means-shifts and domain jumps: When an entire goal network lacks instrumentality to fulfill a need, the activation strength of the entire goal network weakens. Following the constant sum principle, there must be increased activation elsewhere. A leap may occur when an unfulfilled need causes leakage of activation to constructs outside the goal network. The content that is activated in the broader cognitive network might only be intuitively or indirectly associated with the need. Hence, motivation could surge toward novel pursuits.

Regardless of whether or not a leap is subjectively experienced as an insight, a realization, a moment of clarity, or a new calling, a leap may be marked by a sea change in the direction or quality of one’s attention and efforts and characterized by a heightened expectancy of need fulfillment. Any expectations of need fulfillment could be mere assumptions, derived from wishful thinking or inferred from a lifetime of implicit learning about the instrumentality of related courses of action (e.g., Lewicki, 1986]]). Hence, the expectancy need not be logical; it could be associative or heuristic—that is, one intuitively believes it is instrumental but cannot articulate why. Correlational studies suggest that people are apt to distinguish when their expectancies of goal attainment are mainly based on intuitive faith, rather than logic and reason (Leander, 2022]]).

Yet, a leap is not random: It still follows associative cognitive network principles. The cognitive network already provides an associative link between the need and target of the leap; the linkage may be direct enough to afford a rather logical leap. However, the linkage may also be indirect—connected to the need only via a daisy chain of linked cognitive constructs. The associative pathway may not even be salient to the individual, and it is up to them to retrace the chain of associations that leads back to the need. In other words, it may be a leap of faith. Through a process of spreading activation, the leap to the new focal position, in the cognitive network, may inevitably prime the very associative pathways that initially led to the leap; alternatively, the sprawl of spreading activation that begins upon psychological arrival at the new focal position may reveal alternative pathways that trace back to the need. Hence, the individual need not follow the same pathway back to the need that initially triggered the leap, if other—more instrumental—pathways become accessible and discoverable (e.g., Pothos & Busemeyer, 2022]]).

A leap can occur independently of any motivational conflicts. The nascence of the new pursuit might correspond with a lack of awareness that conflicts exist; the individual might also ignore conflicts pertaining to a goal network that has lost its instrumentality. Leaps might even be propelled when a goal conflict increases the perceived instrumentality of the new pursuit (Kopetz et al., 2019]]).

Accordingly, leaps can involve disengagement from a current goal network or other constraint. The disengagement could be necessary or optional, partial or absolute, gradual or abrupt. Whereas a logical leap could be planned, to minimize risks to one’s goal network, a leap of faith may require acting first and learning the consequences later. The disengagement may be intentional—it could take a leap of faith to shed an unfulfilling relationship, career, or lifestyle, to create room for new pursuits. The disengagement could be cognitive as well as motivational: A relaxation of cognitive constraints may be required if one is to engage in the intuitive thinking involved in creative insight (Hodgkinson et al., 2008]]). Even a quantum leap in scientific reasoning can require letting go of existing paradigms of thought (Kuhn, 1970]]; Pothos & Busemeyer, 2022]]). Yet, the perceived risks of disengagement could be why people hesitate or inhibit themselves from leaping.

#### Examples of Leaps

Leaps may already be documented in psychological research. We first consider mortality salience. The need to survive will inevitably be thwarted by death unless one achieves a form of immortality. Means-shifts and domain jumps are insufficient because there are no realistic means to immortality (cf. Jonas et al., 2014]]). People are nevertheless motivated to try and are thus receptive to a range of compensatory alternatives. One alternative is magical thinking and the seeking of symbolic immortality. To overcome death anxiety, religions foster belief in reincarnation or an afterlife (McClelland, 2010]]); people also seek symbolic immortality by achieving social significance—that is, to “leave a legacy” that can live on when they die (Sligte et al., 2013]]). Alternatively, people could increase their identification with an enduring in-group or cultural worldview (Burke et al., 2010]]). Any uncertainty about the veracity of such beliefs are not a flaw but a feature—magical beliefs are hard to disprove via logic.

People show similar responses to control loss: often compensating for a lack of real-world control by seeking psychological control (Landau et al., 2015]]). Control deprivation increases the perception of patterns in random noise (Whitson & Galinski, 2008). A tendency to impose meaningful patterns onto disconnected stimuli can be useful, but it can also facilitate beliefs in supernatural forces and conspiracies (Forgas & Baumeister, 2019]]). In either case, a leap could involve paradigm shifts in the mind that prioritize control over reality.

Leaps can be risky and (self-)destructive. For example, significance quest theory considers how ordinary people may join extremist causes (Kruglanski, Gelfand, et al., 2015): If a person suffers deep humiliation, lost loved ones, or terminal illness, no goals in their current goal network are sufficient. Whether through introspection or external influence, they may “leap” to radical pursuits not previously considered or imagined. Some leaps may be so life-altering that the person cannot return to their original point of departure. Some leaps can be life-ending.

A person ready to leap could also be susceptible to adverse influence. They could be persuaded to adopt ill-fitting goals, either by demagogues who spread utopian ideals or by everyday marketing of products. Consumer psychology shows how advertisers seek to create a goal–means association between their product and the fulfillment of commonly unmet needs, to persuade potential consumers to buy expensive products or make risky investments (Mandel et al., 2017). An ad may show an expensive smartphone being used by a successful professional (implying achievement) or by someone surrounded by family and friends (implying affiliation). In the 1920s, the “torches of freedom” marketing campaign sought to persuade women to smoke by associating cigarettes with symbols of power and control (Amos & Haglund, 2000]]). Advertisers of the Bushmaster AR-15 semiautomatic rifle sought to associate their product with masculinity (“consider your man card reissued”).

A motivational readiness for leaps may nevertheless be essential for need fulfillment, by facilitating the perception of hidden opportunities, or relaxing constraints on thought and behavior in fleeting moments of opportunity (Shah et al., 2009]]). Leaps of faith may even be the basis for self-fulfilling prophecies: William James (1897)]] argued that even scientists must sometimes take a leap of faith—committing to a hypothesis and pursuing it relentlessly, over time, just to create the conditions in which they can find out if their hypotheses are true. Leaps born from desperation can turn out to be masterstrokes.

### Toward an SJL Perspective on Adaptive Goal Pursuit

As we celebrate 20 years of goal systems theory, we consider how some speculation could expand the theory’s scope and explanatory power. Doing so requires a deliberate effort to push the tenets of the theory to their most extreme conclusions (McGuire, 1997]]). One must also consider seemingly irrelevant phenomena that fit within the scope of the theory, even if they are not explicitly articulated by its basic principles. For those who want to realize the full potential of the theory, it may require a willingness to take intellectual risks—perhaps even a leap of faith—to jot down some ideas and subject them to scrutiny.

In this spirit, we propose three variants of means substitution that may occur in pursuit of need fulfillment and their different structures, processes, and outputs. A basic means-shift entails shifting between means and subgoals within a current goal tree. However, the instrumentality of basic means-shifts may be limited, and people could, instead, shift “upward,” to the level of the unfulfilled need, to jump to some other goal, in another domain, that serves the same need. Domain jumps may be characterized by secondary psychological changes that either facilitate motivational readiness for the new goal or are incidental consequences of spreading activation from the new focal position in one’s cognitive network.

A leap involves searching for means beyond the current goal network. Theorizing about leaps opens new process considerations, such as looking to one’s broader cognitive network for ideas and shedding constraints. A motivational readiness to leap could facilitate openness to novel inputs and the detection of new affordances (Gibson, 1979]]) but also susceptibility to magical thinking, adverse influence, and temptations. Leaps of faith may be especially risky, but their self-regulatory potential is ripe for exploration.

#### Theoretical Articulation May Reveal New Directions for Goal Systems Theory

Our conjecture on these variants of means substitution can be useful for new hypothesis generation. Just as different goals and means compete with and/or inhibit one another (Shah et al., 2002]]), so too might there be interdomain competition and inhibition. Goal system dynamics could occur at multiple levels, especially if goals and means are nested within goal trees that are themselves nested in different domains. If a focal domain loses instrumentality and no longer exerts inhibitory pressures, domains that were previously suppressed or inhibited may become hyper-accessible and reveal their goal trees.

There can be individual differences in skill, ability, or preference for each variant of means substitution. Some people might deftly shift between means and (sub)goals but lack the wisdom and foresight to jump domains. Seemingly “lucky” people may leap with uncanny success because their intuitive expectancies lead them to be at the right place at the right time. A tendency for clever shifts, wise jumps, and prescient leaps can have qualitatively distinct moderators, including information processing factors related to the structure of cognitive networks (Baronchelli et al., 2013]]), cognitive complexity (Scott, 1962]]), intuitive ability (Benedek et al., 2012]]), or situational differences in psychological construal level (e.g., abstract vs. concrete; Liberman & Trope, 2014]]; Trope & Liberman, 2011]]).

Although shifts, jumps, and leaps have been presented in a sequential order here, they need not occur in any order. Situational factors, such as narrow windows of opportunity (Shah et al., 2009]]) or exposure to new information, may prompt an immediate jump or leap. A jump or leap could be preferred when it is multifinal: After goal failure in one domain, jumping domains could help to fulfill the need in a different way, while also shielding the self from negative self-evaluations in the failed domain (Linville, 1985]]; Tesser, 1988]]). Even if one is making sufficient progress at a focal goal, one could be pulled to jump or leap anyway when one discovers that another domain has fewer constraints or serves additional needs, such as autonomy. People are phenomenologically aware of when they do not feel free (e.g., Bartholomew et al., 2010]]; Radel et al., 2011]]); jumps and leaps may feel liberating when they involve disengaging from self-defeating goals and constraints on one’s freedoms.

With regard to general implications, this chapter treats constraint as an essential starting point for change in a goal network, which is reminiscent of classic social cognitive notions of driving forces and retraining forces. Wright and Brehm’s (1989)]] energization theory proposes that a minimal level of goal difficulty is required to motivate effort; hence, one way to motivate goal pursuit is to impose constraints and obstacles to its attainment (e.g., Fishbach et al., 2010]]; Leander et al., 2014]]; Zhang & Fishbach, 2010]]). The notion that absolute freedom is a starting point could be inherent to Western thinking (cf. Rosich, 2020]]). Absolute freedom could be aversive (Fromm, 1941]]); people might prefer operating within the constraints of their current goal network when it provides security or certainty. Nevertheless, to circumvent or shed constraints, the development of means-substitution responses can form a basis for personal growth: People who learn to jump or leap may develop rich motivational structures that facilitate need fulfillment.

To conclude, to the extent that needs find a way to their fulfillment, goal systems theory offers an array of structures and processes to make it possible. After 20 years of development and application, the theory has matured enough to become a platform for conjecture. The concepts proposed here are hardly authoritative or exhaustive; whether there is just one mechanism of means substitution, three distinct variants, or many variants is an empirical question. What matters is to entertain these hypotheticals, to push the theory forward to reveal its ultimate potential—or its final limits.

Problem Solving from a Goal-Systems Perspective](04_Contents1.xhtml#n0011)

Benjamin A. Converse

Students new to the literature on problem solving could be forgiven for completing their studies without thinking much about motivation or goal pursuit. Problem solving has traditionally been the domain of cognitive science (Holyoak, 1984]]; Newell & Simon, 1972]]; Reitman, 1964]]), and motivation—if acknowledged as a part of problem solving at all—has usually been treated as an outside force whose magnitude and quality fuel those cognitive processes (Amabile, 1995]]; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988]]; Güss et al., 2017]]; Simon, 1967]]). More typically, though, motivation is treated as separate, as “what happens next,” once a problem is solved and becomes a goal.

Given this treatment in the literature, one can easily fall into a “separatist” view that tacitly pairs information processing with problem solving and motivation with subsequent goal pursuit. From this view, cognition and motivation both contribute to achieving desired transformations; but they do so like teammates in a relay race: First, one’s inner problem-solver processes information to formulate possible paths to the goal; then, the problem solver hands off the baton to one’s inner goal-pursuer, who self-regulates the action required to close the gap. (If things are not going well, the goal pursuer may need to pass the baton back to the problem solver at some point; but, in any event, only one racer carries the baton at a time.) In contrast to a separatist view—and inspired by arguably the most fundamental contribution of goal systems theory (Kruglanski et al., 2002]])—this chapter seeks to recast the problem-solving cycle through an integrative framework that treats “motivation as cognition.” The relationship between cognition and motivation is less like a relay race, I argue, and more like a three-legged race. Motivation and cognition are bound together throughout problem solving, as they are throughout goal pursuit.

The foundation of this analysis is the goal system, a mental representation of interconnected goals and means. My basic assumption is that _problems_ are nothing more or less than _incomplete goal systems_. Whenever an individual has the inclination to transform the status quo but lacks a subjectively adequate representation of the appropriate means, subgoals, and/or goals, that individual faces a problem. From this view, a goal-systems framework is not merely relevant to problem solving—it is the essence of problem solving. I hope to illustrate how viewing problem solving through a goal-systems lens sheds new light on classic problem-solving phenomena, introduces new potential paths to promoting advantageous problem solving, and raises novel questions for problem-solving and goal-pursuit research.

The first section (“Elements”) orients readers to the main components of problem-solving frameworks and maps their connection to the main components of goal systems theory. The second section (“Processes”) works through the steps of a generic problem-solving cycle, highlighting some ways that the allocational, structural, and motivational properties of goal systems manifest in and influence people’s attempts to identify problems, represent those problems, and generate solutions. The third section (“Opportunities”) identifies sample questions that arise from exploring the integrated view, with the hope that they will stimulate a wave of mutually beneficial research. I close with recognition of notable omissions and a brief summary.

### Elements: Mapping Problem Components to Goal Systems

Goal systems theory proposes a dynamic, cognitive approach to motivation and goal pursuit by specifying that “the cognitive properties of goal systems set the constraints within which the motivational properties may express themselves” (Kruglanski et al., 2002]], p. 333). It emphasizes the interconnected nature of goals and means, including their hierarchical organization and differentially strong associations; and the zero-sum allocational properties that constrain how much cognitive resource may be directed at any given component or relationship in the system. It further emphasizes that, within this structural arrangement, motivational properties such as utility maximization, progress-monitoring, persistence, and substitutability determine one’s dynamic representation, prioritization, and pursuit of a given goal. My basic claim in this chapter is that the dynamic, integrated approach specified by goal systems theory is as validly and valuably applied to problem solving as it is to goal pursuit.

This analysis starts with the assumption that both goal pursuit and problem solving are mentally organized around goal systems. The mental work traditionally referred to as _problem solving_ involves filling in goal systems that have critical holes. This view is wholly consistent with widely adopted definitions of problem solving, though some emphasize only unknown means, whereas others acknowledge that goals may also be unknown. For example, according to Newell and colleagues’ classic definition, “a problem exists whenever a problem solver desires some outcome or state of affairs that he does not immediately know how to attain” (1959, p. 1). The same view is explicit in Duncker’s statement that “a problem arises when a living creature has a goal but does not know how this goal is to be reached. Whenever one cannot go from the given situation to the desired situation simply by action, then there has to be recourse to thinking” (1945, p. 1). While these two descriptions imply a relatively well-specified goal state with uncertain means, some broader definitions, especially those that emphasize “ill-defined” problems, are more explicit that for some problems “the precise expression of an acceptable goal state is not given” (Eastman, 1969]], p. 669; see also Reitman, 1964]]). Thus, whether a problem involves only unknown means or involves unknown means and goals, it is well described as an incomplete goal system.

Information-processing perspectives on problem solving tend to emphasize four basic components of the mental models: representations of _objects_ (the entities and relations among entities that may be involved in solution attempts), _operators_ (concrete actions or abstract action categories that the solver may pursue to transform the current situation), _constraints_ (the real or perceived limits on valid solutions), and _goals_ (a description, at any level of abstraction, of the state that the problem solver wishes to achieve). Some even acknowledge a hierarchical structure of means, subgoals, and goals (e.g., Miller et al., 1960; Newell et al., 1959]]). Mapping these elements to goal-systems constructs requires only a few clarifications and new specifications.

First, goal frameworks tend to use _means_ to refer to both goal-pursuit behaviors (i.e., operators) and goal-pursuit tools (i.e., objects). For example, in goal-pursuit lingo, “sneakers” and “run” are both means to the goal of “get out of here,” whereas, in problem-solving lingo, “sneakers” are an object and “run” is an operator.

Second, _constraints_ may be best conceptualized as an evaluation of another element’s validity (i.e., objects, operators, or goals), rather than as an element in itself. This point simply recognizes that people are unlikely to activate what they cannot do but rather are likely to consider whether they can do something and then evaluate it. For example, a new chess player might think “can the pawn move backward?” and then “no, it cannot,” rather than represent the idea “not move backward.” The constraint still requires semantic knowledge (thus its recognition as an element in problem-solving representations), but I treat that knowledge as orthogonal to the fundamental hierarchical organization of means and goals in a goal system.

Third, it will be useful for the current analysis to add some precision to the goal construct. Throughout this chapter, I adopt the specific definition of a goal as a “cognitive representation of a desired endpoint” (or end state; e.g., Fishbach & Ferguson, 2007]]). The key is that I reserve the term _goal_ for relatively specific representations of the end state. From this view, “lose 5 pounds” is a clear goal. If the aspiring dieter knows how they will pursue that goal (maybe, “jog three times per week” and “cut down on French fries”), there is no problem; but if they have not identified a set of means that seems appropriate to them, then they first have a problem to solve. (Of course, this is a simplified view—many new problems may arise during goal pursuit, with each needing to be solved in turn.)

The goal construct becomes less straightforward, however, at higher levels of abstraction or fuzzier levels of representation. Is “live a healthier life” a goal? How about “live a better life”? In this chapter, I do not refer to these general desires as _goals_ because they require the individual to identify a more specific representation of the end state. This is an important distinction in the problem-solving space because defining the end state (i.e., identifying a subjectively acceptable representation of the desired transformation) becomes a critical aspect of the problem. It is a state of affairs that requires “recourse to thinking,” in Duncker’s words. In Newell and colleagues’ words, there is “imperfect knowledge about how to proceed” with respect to not only the operators and objects but also to the goal itself.

I rely on the term _aim_ to describe one’s desire to move away from the status quo, toward some undefined but preferred end state. The distinction I hope to provide intuition for is that a _goal_ has a specific, definable target, whereas an _aim_ has only desired direction (even if that direction is no more defined than “away,” “different,” or “not the current state of affairs”). I will refer to problematic situations that are motivated by aims away from the status quo as _generic transformation problems_ (e.g., “something has to change”) and to the subset of those that are motivated by aims toward something generally better as _generic improvement problems_ (e.g., “live a better life”). I will refer to problematic situations that are motivated by a specific goal (e.g., “lose 5 pounds,” “win the game”) as _means problems_. In goal systems terms, this distinction highlights how many layers of a goal systems hierarchy need to be defined to solve the problem (see Figure 10.1]]). Generic transformation problems require the problem solver to identify a suitable goal and appropriate means, whereas a (mere) means problem only requires the problem solver to determine appropriate means.[^1]

A means problem has a specific goal but undetermined means. A generic transformation problem has a general aim away from the status quo but undetermined goal and means.

### Processes: How Goal-System Properties Manifest in Problem Solving

Broad frameworks that encompass the full “problem-solving cycle” tend to identify five iterative steps (Pretz et al., 2003]]; see also Bransford & Stein, 1993]]; Hayes, 1989]]). Problem solvers must first identify a problem. Then they begin the work of defining and representing the problem. Next, searching memory and the environment, they develop potential solution strategies. They organize and evaluate that knowledge and decide whether to proceed. If they proceed, then they begin the sequence that traditionally encompasses goal pursuit: They allocate resources, monitor progress, and decide when to disengage. The overall process is not always linear, but each step builds on those before it.

Recognizing that the fourth and fifth steps—means evaluation and regulating progress—are more naturally the domain of goal-systems analysis (in this volume alone, see Chapters 1]], [^2], [^5], and [^7]), this chapter focuses on the first three steps of the problem-solving cycle. It explores how problem identification, problem representation, and solution generation may be affected by the three categories of goal-system properties: allocational properties, which stem “from the attentional resource limitations that characterize all deliberate cognitive functioning”; structural properties, which “stem from [the] cognitive interconnectedness [of goals and means]”; and motivational properties, which include commitment, striving, and substitutability (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; see Table 10.1]]).

#### Step 1: Problem Identification

Problem identification—whether the problem is presented, discovered, or created—initiates the problem-solving cycle (Getzels, 1982]]; Getzels & Csikszentmihalyi, 1975]]). Presented problems are those that someone else identifies. This occurs, for example, when an experimenter presents a problem to a research participant or when a boss presents a problem to an employee. Otherwise, individuals must find the problem for themselves. Found problems may be discovered or created. A problem is _discovered_ when an individual is going about other business and notices that a particular situation is not the way they want it to be. This occurs, for example, when a teacher recognizes that the students are not following the material or when a relationship partner realizes that the other is dissatisfied. I presume that problems are most often discovered within the context of an active goal. A problem is _created_ when the individual decides to pursue a novel but unspecified transformation. For example, an artist may consciously decide to find a new topic to explore, or an entrepreneur may resolve to find a value-creation opportunity (Csikszentmihalyi & Getzels, 1971]]). I presume problems are most often created outside the context of a focal goal. Mapping this distinction onto goal systems suggests that problem discovery may begin as more of an “intra-systemic” phenomenon (Kruglanski & Köpetz, 2009]]) but become “inter-systemic” if one identifies potential connections to other goal systems; and problem creation may be more “inter-systemic” throughout, involving the consideration of goal systems that are unrelated (or only distally related) to a focal goal.

Whether presented, discovered, or created, we can think of problem initiation as the activation of an incomplete goal system to which one feels committed enough to devote continued attention (see Fishbach & Ferguson, 2007]]; Förster & Liberman, 2007]]; Higgins, 1996]]). A diverse set of stimuli (including semantic associations, social concepts, previous means, and situational opportunities) can activate a goal system, and these associations vary idiosyncratically (see Kruglanski & Köpetz, 2009]]; Shah & Kruglanski, 2003]]). Generally speaking, activation of a “complete” or “incomplete” goal system (i.e., goal or problem) should follow the same processes (Altmann & Trafton, 2002]]); but two sets of questions specific to problem solving may be more challenging and more generative. First, under what conditions do people activate “new” problems, outside of focal goal pursuit? Second, what determines commitment to a problem given that—by definition—the means are unknown at the outset, and the specific goal might be as well?

##### Allocational Properties and Problem Finding

Goal pursuit induces a kind of functional myopia—the individual’s attention and efforts are directed at the current task, with decreased capacity for alternatives (Büttner et al., 2014]]; Mayr & Keele, 2000]]; Shah et al., 2002]]). The more committed the individual is to the focal goal, the more strongly the individual will shield it from competing alternatives (Shah et al., 2002]]). All things equal, then, active goal pursuit should facilitate problem discovery within a focal goal system and interfere with problem creation outside the focal goal system. The scientist who is knowledgeable across fields and always working on something may be the one most poised to discover a new problem (and if the scientist’s attention is broad enough at the right time, potentially recognize its multiple implications), but the scientist who also reserves “goal-free” time may be the one most poised to create a new research question. And both scientists may be better off when they can take a sabbatical in an unfamiliar environment, allowing for the contextual dependence of goal systems to manifest in reorganized associations (e.g., Maddux et al., 2010]]).

##### Structural Properties and Problem Finding

Putting aside means problems that arise in the course of active goal pursuit, the basic interconnectedness of goal system entities implies that individuals are more likely to create new problems in domains that are adjacent to, but not competing with, recently active goal systems. On the one hand, active goals increase perceptual readiness for related, facilitative constructs (Bruner & Goodman, 1947]]; Fishbach & Ferguson, 2007]]; Glenberg, 1997]]; Shah & Kruglanski, 2003]]). For example, thirsty (vs. not thirsty) people are more likely to find drinking-related objects in the environment (Aarts et al., 2001]]); and students who need to study are more likely to think of their studious friends, whereas students who are looking to unwind are more likely to think of their fun friends (Fitzsimons & Shah, 2008]]). On the other hand, active goals also inhibit the potential distraction of competing constructs (Shah et al., 2002]]). For example, a dieter would be slower to recognize a tempting stimulus like “donut” following a goal prime (e.g., “healthy”) than not following a goal prime (Fishbach et al., 2003]]); and students inhibit activation of their friends’ goals when those goals would interfere with their own fundamental motives (Leander et al., 2011]]). Together, these activation and inhibition principles suggest that there may be a relatedness “sweet spot” in terms of the kinds of goals an individual is pursuing and the kinds of new problems they are likely to recognize during an intentional creation exercise.

##### Motivational Properties and Problem Finding

Goal commitment is generally a function of the subjective value of the desired end state and the expectancy of attainment (based largely on the means available and one’s self-perceived ability to put them to good use; Atkinson, 1974]]; Eccles & Wigfield, 2002]]; Lewin et al., 1944]]). But at the outset of problem solving, key contributors to these impressions are missing. In a traditional means problem, the problem solver has a clear representation of the desired end state on which to base their value judgment; but with means critically unspecified, they would have significantly more uncertainty surrounding their judgment of expectancy. These questions are further complicated in the case of a generic transformation problem. Here, the problem solver does not have a clear representation of the means or the goal, contributing to ambiguity about value and expectancy. What determines one’s level of commitment to a trip that has neither a map nor a destination? Perhaps for these problems, the value of an aim derives largely from its perceived connection to more distal motives (e.g., Fiske, 2003]]; McClelland, 1985]]) and current motivational concerns (e.g., regulatory focus, regulatory mode).

An additional benefit of the integrated cognitive–motivational perspective is that it prompts us to ask whether motivational concerns might affect activation of an incomplete goal system in the first place. For instance, do chronic locomotors, who have their heads down in pursuit of progress, tend to discover more internal problems, whereas chronic assessors, who more deliberately monitor the environment, tend to create more external problems (Kruglanski et al., 2000]])? From a more dynamic perspective, do situations that increase locomotion concerns—such as being near the end of a critical performance-review period, perhaps—close one’s mind to finding new external problems (Kruglanski et al., 2013]])? Competing background goals might also interfere with problem discovery. For example, social goals to fit in may compete with task goals and negatively predict the information-sharing and dissent that enable problem discovery (De Dreu, 2006; Farh et al., 2010]]; Sunstein & Hastie, 2008]]).

##### Flipping the Script: Problem Finding and Motivation

Finally, I note that the tacit causal model in this section has emphasized how goal systems affect problem finding; but problem finding may also affect goal systems, especially with respect to commitment and value. One quasi-experimental study with high-school math students, for example, found that the students generated more solutions for a problem they had invented than for equivalent problems that had been presented to them (Runco & Okuda, 1988]]). In other words, consistent with models of intrinsic motivation in education (Black & Deci, 2000]]; Hulleman & Harackiewicz, 2009]]), letting people find their own problems may increase how committed they are to solving them (see also Kruglanski et al., 2018]]; see Chapter 3]] in this volume).

#### Step 2: Problem Representation

Once a problem has been identified, the individual begins to form a mental model of the status quo situation. The objects that the problem solver perceives and the operator affordances that they identify with respect to those objects will define at least the initial list of candidate solutions (with more to come from memory in the subsequent solution-generation phase). Consider the example of a city’s parking crunch (Pretz et al., 2003]]). Someone who initially represents the problem as one of “not enough parking spaces” would begin solution generation by trying to think of places to put in new parking spaces. (“Can we install car lifts?” “Turn more parks into lots?”) Someone else who instead represents the problem as one of “too many idle cars during the workday” would begin solution generation by trying to think of ways to have fewer idle cars sitting around. (“Can commuters rent their cars out to Uber drivers?” “Can we incentivize carpooling?”) Extant goal systems that might be active when the individual sizes up the potential problem in the first place will bias the subsequent solution set.

##### Allocational Properties and Problem Representation

Disproportionate attention to one potential means comes at the cost of attention to potential alternative means. Maier’s classic “two-string problem” (1931) illustrates how subtle shifts in attention can affect problem representation and, consequently, the likelihood of reaching an insightful solution. Participants facing this problem are instructed to tie together two strings that are hanging overhead at opposite ends of a room. The strings are long enough to be tied together but short enough that participants cannot walk to one hanging string, grab its end, and still be able to reach the other stationary string. Aside from their own bodies, there are some objects in the room that may be potential means, such as a pair of pliers. One way to solve the problem is to attach an object, such as the pliers, to one of the strings so that it can be swung like a pendulum. This allows the participant to grab the stationary string, walk it to the middle, and catch the swinging pendulum. But to most people it is not obvious how one might use an object like pliers in this case, and it is more “obvious” that one needs to somehow increase one’s reach.

From a goal-systems perspective, the more that individuals attend to a particular means, such as their own arms or a long ruler that they might use to somehow corral one string in their direction, the less attention they have available for considering the role of the pliers or the possibility of a swinging string (see Figure 10.2]]). In Maier’s original problem, when the experimenter “incidentally” bumped into the string multiple times, to set it swinging back and forth, some of those participants who had initially overlooked this solution managed to identify it. This particular intervention represents a shift of attention due to external forces; but to the extent that individuals experience a lower cognitive load (or learn to manage a higher cognitive load), they should have more resources available for attending to unexplored aspects of the environment (Mayer, 1998]]; Mayer & Moreno, 2003).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-030.gif)

Figure 10.2 Goal-systems representation of Maier’s two-string problem. Without intervention (left/bottom), the problem solver searches for means to satisfy an impossible subgoal. When the experimenter bumps one string to set it swinging (represented by the lightning bolt; right/top), the attention shift leads some problem solvers to consider a different—and more promising—subgoal and means.

Allocational properties also affect problem representation over a longer-term horizon. Once an individual has developed relatively stable representations of certain goal systems, those systems can be accessed with less cognitive effort, freeing up resources for representing other parts of the problem (Gobet et al., 2001]]; Higgins, 1996]]). In a classic demonstration of this “chunking” phenomenon, undergraduates organized physics problems based on surface features, whereas graduate physics students organized them based on deeper features such as the principles required to solve them (i.e., based on being solvable by similar means; Chi et al., 1981]]). Chess experts (vs. novices) appear to do the same, representing more complex constellations of board positions that accomplish coordinated goals of defense or attack (Chase & Simon, 1973]]; Gobet & Simon, 1996]]). Having easy access to these well-developed schemas frees up their attention for other tasks.

##### Structural Properties and Representation

Classic barriers to creative problem solving, such as functional fixedness and self-imposed assumptions, are illuminated by considering structural properties of goal systems. Functional fixedness has been characterized as both a perceptual problem and a competition between habitual responses (Glucksberg, 1962]]). Taking account of structural properties of a goal system helps to reconcile these views. Duncker’s famous “candle problem” (1945; Adamson, 1952]]) is nearly synonymous with functional fixedness. Participants in this scenario encounter a candle, a candle holder, a box of tacks, and the presented problem to securely mount the lit candle on a vertical screen so that it may overhang a table without dripping wax on it. The problem can be solved by dumping out the tacks and using the box that held them as a makeshift sconce. Arriving at this solution requires the problem solver to overcome the impression that the box may only be used as a container for the tacks. From a goal-systems perspective, it is the strong association between the box and its function of holding tacks that interferes with the potential representation of the box as a multifinal means that could also hold the candle. Indeed, when the association between _box_ and _holding tacks_ is weakened—for example, in a condition where participants initially encounter the box independent of the tacks—participants are quicker to recognize the box as a means to the goal of holding the candle (Adamson, 1952]]; Duncker, 1945]]).

More generally, one’s ability to move beyond assumptions of unifinality—operationalized most famously by alternative-uses tasks—has been celebrated as a key dimension of creative potential (Guilford, 1971]]). Having a vast cognitive repertoire of associations one might make, and the motivational will to keep searching for and generating those associations, is valuable for problem solving. A goal-systems perspective broadens the approaches that one might take to actively increase creative potential. It suggests, for instance, that broadening one’s attentional scope can momentarily increase the variety of associations that come to mind (Friedman et al., 2003]]). It also suggests that diluting the association between a given means and its focal goal—for example, by adding other goal-related associations (Zhang et al., 2007]])—could facilitate one’s ability to see that means in flexible ways (George & Wiley, 2019]]; Weatherford et al., 2021]]). Imagine an alternative version of Duncker’s candle problem that added an otherwise irrelevant box full of pennies to the situation. The structural prediction here would be that seeing one small box holding tacks and a similar small box holding pennies could weaken the association between the box and its function of holding tacks, increasing the chance that problem solvers would recognize yet other functions for the box, including the critical one of holding the candle (see Figure 10.3]]).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-031.gif)

Figure 10.3 Goal-systems representation of functional fixedness and two interventions. Without intervention, the problem solver only considers the box as a means to hold the tacks (functional fixedness; left/bottom). When the box and tacks are presented independently (middle), problem solvers are more likely to consider other potential subgoals accomplished by the box. Asking the problem solver to consider other goals accomplished by the box (e.g., hold pennies; right/top) might weaken the box–tacks association and increase the chance of considering other subgoals the box can serve.

Goal systems theory also suggests that chronically (or recently) activated goal-system elements are likely to influence how a problem finder represents the problem in the first place. The idea of _Maslow’s hammer_—if the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail—describes this tendency from the perspective of a chronically accessible means. A classic management study asked mid-level managers from three different departments at a large manufacturing firm to read a business case and diagnose the business’s main problem so that they could make a recommendation to a new, incoming president (Dearborn & Simon, 1958]]). Despite all three groups reading identical materials, sales managers overwhelmingly perceived the firms’ problem to be one of marketing, production managers perceived it to be a problem of organizational design, and human resources managers perceived it to be one of relationships. In this study, nearly all of the participants appeared to use Maslow’s hammer, leading them to represent the problem as connected to the tools they themselves most often used.

##### Motivational Properties and Problem Representation

It is definitional to say that the more committed one is to a given endeavor, the harder that individual will work to solve problems related to that goal. But applying a goal-systems framework allows us to ask other questions about commitment and problem representation, including about commitment to background goals and about the quality of one’s commitment.

It is not only the content of one’s goals and means that may bias problem representation but also the quality of one’s recent or chronic motivation (Fishbach et al., 2004]]). For example, an individual who is chronically prevention-focused may tend to think of “making it better” by pursuing a preferred state that fulfills all obligations, whereas an individual who is chronically promotion-focused may tend to think of “making it better” by pursuing a preferred state that grows toward aspirations (Higgins, [^1987], [^1997]). These representations, in turn, will guide the search for means in different directions.

In addition to “intra-systemic” insights, a goal systems framework invites “meta-motivational” insights with respect to problem solving (i.e., about “problem-solving motivation”). For instance, some individuals are committed to gathering and organizing information to help them structure their understanding of the world (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982]]; Cacioppo et al., 1996]]). Indeed, these chronically high–“need for cognition” individuals spend more time and effort gathering information to solve complex problems (Nair & Ramnarayan, 2000]]). In at least one study, this information-gathering tendency was well calibrated and efficient: In a management simulation, dispositional need for cognition correlated strongly with the diversity of information that problem solvers gathered (and only weakly with the raw amount of information they gathered) and, in turn, predicted problem-solving effectiveness (Nair & Ramnarayan, 2000]]). The goal-systems perspective thus reminds us to consider both commitment to the goal or aim and “meta-commitment” to efficiently filling in an incomplete goal system before proceeding to act on it.

It appears that situational cues can trigger similar levels of commitment. For example, when individuals experience difficulty transferring knowledge within a firm, the experience of difficulty cues them to direct more effort at studying (i.e., representing) and resolving (i.e., generating solutions for) the relevant problem (March & Simon, 1958]]; Szulanski, 2000]]). From here, precisely how the individual responds to that difficulty may also depend on individual differences. When a given goal pursuit gets difficult, individuals who are high in self-awareness tend to adopt a problem-solving orientation, whereas individuals who are prone to rumination are more likely to get “stuck” on the current formulation of the problem (Burwell & Shirk, 2007]]; Kreibich et al., 2022]]; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991]]; Trapnell & Campbell, 1999]]). Thus, depending on an individual’s chronic tendencies, encountering challenges may result in doubling-down on the original path to goal pursuit or in pausing to reassess other possible paths.

#### Step 3: Solution Generation

The work of generating solutions is perhaps the “headliner” act in the problem-solving cycle. Before problem solvers can produce a given transformation, they must activate a representation of that transformation. In this section I examine two problem-solving barriers, fixation and heuristic search, through the lens of goal systems theory.

##### Structural Properties and Solution Generation

In the previous section, I discussed how Maslow’s hammer affects one’s representation of the status quo. The same principle should apply to one’s memory search for what is possible. If most of your problems are nails and you do not have a hammer handy, you tend to look for a brick, book, or rock that can substitute as a hammer. In one set of studies, knowledgeable baseball fans (vs. people with low baseball knowledge) were more likely to get stuck on remote-associates problems that asked them to come up with a word that connected _plate_, _broken_, and _shot_. Before breaking away from their baseball associations to correctly discover _glass_, the baseball fans would tend to get hung up on _home_ (Wiley, 1998]]). Warning the high-knowledge participants not to use their baseball knowledge did not help them avoid activation of this well-developed schema, and warning the low-knowledge participants actually backfired by situationally priming the schema. Further, adding a short break after a warning helped the low-knowledge participants get away from the baseball-related mental set but did not help the high-knowledge participants. Situationally primed goals can be deactivated, and their mental sets broken, by directing attention elsewhere; but chronically accessible goals are harder to beat.

Notably, these structural ties also present a problem for knowledge transfer from one domain to the other (Bassock, 2003). The strength of association between a particular knowledge element (e.g., means, goal) and the context in which it was initially learned or typically applied should predict a lower likelihood of activating that knowledge element in other contexts. _Analogical transfer_—that is, learning to recognize similarities in relationships between different elements across contexts—is one path to overcoming this knowledge-transfer challenge (Bassock, 2003; Gick & Holyoak, 1983]]; Novick, 1988]]).

Structural properties also explain the intuition that breaking from one’s work to walk in nature, take a scenic drive, or enjoy a long shower can be helpful in producing insights—it momentarily deactivates recently activated associations. A meta-analysis of 117 studies found that these periods of incubation do have a positive effect on insight and that filling them with high–cognitive demand tasks decreases their productivity (Sio & Ormerod, 2009]]). There is still a role for knowledge (expertise), of course; but the ideal state for generating new connections may be one where the relevant constructs and connections are available but not active (e.g., Baird et al., 2012]]; Smith & Blankenship, 1991]]; Yaniv & Meyer, 1987]]).

##### Allocational Properties and Solution Generation

When searching the environment (attention) or one’s knowledge store (memory) for potential solutions, that search is unlikely to produce a “fair fight” between all possible ideas. This bias toward activating some kinds of information and not others is an accommodation for allocational limits on cognitive activity. Understanding the rules that govern goal systems should help predict which ideas will be advantaged in that unfair fight and how to level the playing field if so desired.

_Heuristic search strategies_ are strategically limited information searches, in which people attend to a smaller number of promising alternatives (Schwarz & Skurnik, 2003]]; cf., Newell et al., 1959]]). G. A. Miller and colleagues (1960) describe _heuristics_ as being “unsystematic—in a clever way” (p. 160). They describe the trade-off between a systematic search that considers every possible option and a clever search that considers historically promising alternatives by noting that “a systematic Plan, when it is possible, is sure to work, but it may take too long, or cost too much,” whereas “a heuristic Plan may be cheap and quick, but . . . sometimes fail to produce the intended result.” It is important to note that (search) heuristics differ from what is currently the more common referent of heuristics in psychology, judgment heuristics (i.e., substituting an easier question for a harder one; Kahneman, 2011]]).

It might be useful to relate search heuristics to _procedural knowledge_, which tells the problem solver which associative networks or action categories to search in different situations. Over time, any knowledge unit that is routinely relevant—not only specific constructs such as semantic knowledge or episodic memories but also procedural knowledge including mental strategies—should gain activation potential, becoming chronically accessible across situations (Higgins, 1996]]; Smith, 1994]]). As problem solvers develop these mental strategies, they can better organize problem elements and focus their memory searches (Holyoak & Koh, 1987]]). Like any mental shortcut, however, this procedural knowledge can be overapplied, leading people to accept adequate solutions before considering potentially superior alternatives (Higgins, 1996]]; Kahneman, 2003]]; Payne et al., 1992]]).

My collaborators and I have identified an _additive search strategy_ as one such tendency in problem solving (Adams et al., 2021]]). Based on a series of observational and experimental studies, we argued that problem solvers default to an additive search—asking first what new components they can introduce to improve an object, situation, or idea—and consequently tend to neglect subtractive improvements. For example, in one of our experiments, participants viewed a design created by green squares arranged on a 10 × 10 grid of white squares. The designs were nearly symmetrical from top to bottom and from left to right, except that one quadrant had some extraneous marks. Participants—who had already learned that they could toggle the individual squares back and forth between green and white by clicking on them—further learned that their job was to fix the patterns’ symmetry and, critically, to do so in the fewest clicks possible. This last constraint meant that, although the patterns could become symmetrical by adding green boxes to the three empty quadrants, there was an objectively better solution that could be achieved by subtracting the extraneous boxes from the overfilled quadrant. Supporting the additive search hypothesis, participants who tried to solve the problem under a higher (vs. lower) cognitive load—and were thus more (vs. less) likely to rely on a heuristic search strategy—were more likely to overlook the subtractive solution. It appears that, dependent on attentional constraints, participants restricted their solution generation to the heuristically determined search space.

Beyond identifying the direct implications of an additive search strategy, I hope that our work on this problem-solving heuristic will stimulate renewed effort in research that documents specific heuristic search strategies. Despite Newell and colleagues’ (1959) description of problem-solving theory as being centrally concerned with discovering systems of heuristics, subsequent research trends have led to long lists of judgment heuristics but much shorter lists of search heuristics. Related work in the problem-solving space has tended to focus on how specific contexts or expertise induce mental sets but has been less active in identifying broad procedural “rules” that direct people’s solution searches.

##### Motivational Properties and Solution Generation

Though allocational properties constrain deep and broad solution searches, commitment can—under the right conditions—expand those searches. An intrinsic quality of commitment to a problem facilitates playful thinking and persistence in solution generation over time (Amabile, 1997]]; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988). Though individuals often underestimate the quality of solutions that come to mind later (vs. earlier) in the solution-generation process (Lucas & Nordgren, 2015]], 2020), persistence allows them to get beyond heuristic search strategies (Adams et al., 2021]]; Schwartz & Skurnik, 2003) and to explore novel associations (Simonton, 2003]]; Smith et al., 1995]]).

With the benefits of intrinsic motivation acknowledged, a goal-systems perspective can also help to reconcile the sometimes negative effects of increased motivation. Under pressure, increased incentives can lead to a “dysfunctional” rather than “functional” myopia, increasing convergent thinking and potential fixation effects (Ederer & Manso, 2013]]; Glucksberg, 1962]]; Weisberg & Suls, 1973]]). Although moving individuals toward an intrinsically motivated path out of this conundrum may be preferred in many cases, it is not always feasible. Fortunately, extrinsic incentives paired with divergent-thinking training can have similar effects, leading to increased creativity and productive problem solving (Huo, 2020]]).

### Opportunities: New Questions Raised by a Goal-Systems Perspective

The balance of the previous section involved reinterpreting classic problem-solving phenomena through a goal-systems lens. In this section, I emphasize four potentially generative higher-level questions that follow from the goal-system perspective on problem solving.

#### Structural Distinctions in Incomplete Goal Systems

At the outset, I noted that a goal-systems perspective invites one to pay special attention to whether the problem-solving process is being driven by a specific goal or a more general aim. Future research might productively delve into a search for systematic differences between those problems which have only one “layer” of unknowns (typically, at the level of means) and those which have two “layers” (both means and goals). This in itself is a simplified view because any problem can be further broken down into many layers of subordinate means, means, subgoals, and goals; but there may be fundamental differences in how people approach problems that have more or fewer degrees of freedom at different levels of the goal hierarchy. Do people tend to apply different heuristics when the goal is specified versus not? Under what conditions do searches proceed “top-down,” from goals to means, versus “bottom-up,” from means to goals; and what are the implications of these different paths?

#### Problem-Solving Steps and Goal-System Activation

There may be a natural correlation between one’s temporal path through the steps of the problem-solving cycle and one’s structural direction (i.e., top-down versus bottom-up) working through an incomplete goal system. Representing the problem situation (Step 2) typically involves scanning the environment to determine what objects and operators are available as means. To the extent that some of those means may prime unhelpful or misleading subgoals, as the tack-holding box does in the candle problem, the problem solver may find it challenging to work from the bottom up, from means to goals. In contrast, generating solutions (Step 3) typically involves more memory-based generation of possible goals and subgoals. Working from the top down—from “what do I need to accomplish?” to “how might I accomplish this?”—may be more effective in such a setting. For example, imagine a presentation of Duncker’s candle problem that strips as much of the problem situation as possible from its presentation. The experimenter might say, “Imagine yourself in a room with a candle and some other objects. Your goal is to fix the candle to the wall. What might you do?” In this case, without perceived objects priming potentially distracting operators, it is possible that the individual may start with the subgoal rather than the object, thinking “use a tray or sconce” first. In this case, when subsequently presented with the available objects, the problem solver may be more likely to recognize the box of tacks as useful. Inverting the order of solution generation and problem representation may lead to a top-down process (goal→helpful subgoal→object) instead of a path-blocking bottom-up process (object→unhelpful subgoal). This line of reasoning helps to illustrate how the associations in problem solving, like any associative judgments, can be an efficient blessing in some instances but a biasing curse in others.

#### Solving Simultaneous Problems

Seldom is human thought directed at only one objective at a time (Atkinson & Birch, 1970]]; Neisser, 1963]]). Rather, people are often striving to accomplish multiple goals simultaneously; and, similarly, they are often working to solve multiple problems simultaneously. The downside of hunting for a means that will fill in multiple incomplete goal systems at once is that it reduces the choice set, but the encouraging news is that problem solvers seem able to modulate their search for these multifinal means based on the perceived feasibility of identifying one for the various problems at hand (Köpetz et al., 2011]]). Just as goal-pursuit understanding has benefitted from increased attention to the dynamics of multiple-goal pursuit (Fishbach et al., 2009]]; Unsworth et al., 2014]]), problem-solving research stands to benefit from increased attention to simultaneous problem solving.

#### Chronic Associations, Background Goals, and the Origins of Search Heuristics

As the list of documented search heuristics grows, it will be important to trace the distal causes of those heuristics. This positions one to modulate its development or to intervene on its likely manifestation in a given problem setting. The goal-systems focus on people’s background goals and the associated affect that comes from (successfully or unsuccessfully) pursuing certain means may help in this mission.

Earlier, I discussed the additive search strategy as an example of a heuristic search strategy in problem solving (Adams et al., 2021]]). We suggested that this additive search strategy contributes to a broader behavioral tendency to try to improve objects, ideas, and situations by adding to them, without due consideration for how they might also be improved by subtraction. No empirical research has yet traced the etymology of this particular heuristic search strategy, but analyzing it through the lens of goal systems theory suggests some broad hypotheses. At the level of the individual, it is possible that people conflate _more_ and _better_. In reality, a preferred state could be one that has fewer components or more components. But the cognitive, affective, and motivational associations that people develop with ideas such as _more_, _higher_, _adding_, and _positive_ may reinforce the implicit value of each of those concepts. If this is the case, then changing people’s associations in a given context may be a productive intervention. Advertising the value of “simplicity” or “ruthless efficiency” in a given context, for example, could lead people to shift their search heuristics toward subtraction from addition.

It is also possible that the additive search strategy is developed and reinforced because it contributes to background goals that tend to co-occur with the focal transformation goals. For example, problem solvers may tacitly learn that adding to the status quo not only produces improvements but also (compared to subtraction) better allows one to demonstrate competence and contribution (Baer & Brown, 2012]]). If so, then changing an individual’s background goals might change the solutions they consider. In one of our observational studies, we asked participants to improve a writing sample (Adams et al., 2021]]). Although the original draft included many redundancies and clunky constructions, for every participant who turned in a revision with fewer words than the original, more than two participants turned in a revision with more words than the original. This tendency may partially reflect that students and coworkers often edit documents with the focal goal to make it better and the background goal to present themselves as hardworking, contributing team members. One prediction, then, is that allowing an individual to demonstrate their competence to the team (vs. not) before asking them to edit a team document might decrease the motivational priority of impression management through addition, freeing them up to subtract redundancies.

### Additional Considerations

Some potentially fruitful but neglected connections are worth noting. First, I have not spent much time in this chapter on the motivational property of goal striving, but it is obviously relevant. Future research might explore how previous problem-solving attempts affect subsequent problem-solving attempts (Fishbach et al., 2009]]), in terms of both whether previous attempts were judged as failures or successes and whether those outcomes were generally experienced in a promotion-oriented or prevention-oriented way. In this vein, one influential model of cognitive insight, known as the _prepared-mind perspective_, focuses on the memory advantage conferred by failed goal pursuit (Seifert et al., 1995]]; also, Baddeley, 1963]]; Zeigarnik, 1927]]). It suggests that failed problem-solving attempts are “tagged” for background processing once the individual moves on to other endeavors, but there are many open questions about how memory for unfulfilled goals operates (Altmann & Trafton, 2002]]).

Second, I have not explored the social elements of one’s goal systems in much depth despite this being an area in which goal systems theory has been most productively extended since 2002. Other people and our relationships with them are often represented in goal systems as goals in themselves or as means to valued goals (Converse & Fishbach, 2012]]; Fitzsimons et al., 2015]]; Fitzsimons & Fishbach, 2010]]; Fitzsimons & Shah, 2008]]), and indeed we should expect that problem solvers’ assumptions, interpretations, and memory searches in a problem scenario would be influenced by the social context of those problems.

Third, for simplicity I have framed my analysis in terms of what problem solving misses about motivation; but I could just as plausibly have framed it in terms of what motivation misses about problem solving. Indeed, problem solving is often acknowledged as a precursor to action and a response to obstacles (e.g., Epstude & Roese, 2011]]; Gollwitzer, 1990]]; Marguc et al., 2015]]; Wicklund & Gollwitzer, 1981]]), and the search for appropriate means is a central question for self-regulation research (e.g., Chakravarti & Janiszewski, 2003]]; Köpetz et al., 2011]]; Kreibich et al., 2022]]); but there is still much to be gained with more intentional integration. It seems that we could learn a lot about self regulation by considering, for example, known problem-solving barriers, conditions that promote problem-solving success, and processes that support problem-solving capacity.

### In Closing

In a famous scene from the movie _Apollo 13_, engineers in ground control prepare to solve a challenging problem for the astronauts onboard the spaceship, who are trying, literally, to put a square peg in a round hole. The engineers begin their problem-solving process by dumping cardboard boxes full of gear onto a conference room table. The boxes contain all the objects that the crew has available onboard the ship. The way the objects are physically handled—intermixed in a way that has nothing to do with their original functions—makes clear that no assumptions should be made about their utility for the current problem. The objects’ potential is immediately divorced from its usual goal system, combatting functional fixedness from the outset. In most everyday problems, it is not so easy to divorce objects, actions, or information from their established goal systems. This is neither good nor bad in itself but manifests as a constant trade-off between processing efficiency and creativity.

While motivational approaches to problem solving have emphasized the need for motivated and curious problem solvers, who will continue to look for new problems, study the environment, and generate more and varied solutions (e.g., Amabile, 1995]]; Güss et al., 2017]]; Schwarz & Skurnik, 2003]]; Simon, 1967]]), a goal-systems perspective also recognizes the structural and allocational properties, and the transfer of affective and motivational content that they enable, as critical to problem-solving success. Challenging the “separatist program” and instead depicting “motivation as cognition” has been arguably the most fundamental contribution of goal systems theory. Though more modest in aim, I hope that this chapter helps to cement the inseparable role of a joint cognitive–motivational approach to problem solving.

## Note

[^1]:  Taking a perspective of hierarchical organization, where means, subgoals, and goals can only be defined as such with respect to one another (Fishbach et al., 2004]]; Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; Shaddy & Fishbach, 2018]]), some may view the distinction between aims, which have only the fuzziest representation of an end state, and goals, which are a representation of some specific end state, as merely semantic. I think that acknowledging the specificity of the end state representation is critical in a problem-solving context, however, because specific solution representations can only be evaluated with respect to specific goal representations. In short, sharpening the goal representation is a necessary step in generic transformation problems.

Extremism and the Extreme Personality](04_Contents1.xhtml#n0012)

Ewa Szumowska, Arie W. Kruglanski, and Catalina Kopetz

Extremism manifests across various domains, and widely different behaviors are described as extreme. This includes political and religious extremism, extreme infatuations (“fatal attractions”), extreme dieting, extreme sports, addictions, extreme involvement in a cause, and extreme (obsessive) passions for various activities. Despite the striking differences between these behaviors, what characterizes their extremism is explicable in terms of a common psychological mechanism. Recent theory (Kruglanski, Kopetz, & Szumowska 2021]]; Kruglanski, Szumowska, & Kopetz 2021]]; Kruglanski, Szumowska, Kopetz, et al. 2021), inspired by the goal systems theory (Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2015]), argues that extremism stems from motivational imbalance, whereby a given need gains dominance and overrides other basic concerns. Under such imbalance, mental resources are focused on the prioritized need and are proportionately withdrawn from other needs. As a result, the constraints that the latter exert on behavior are relaxed, thereby allowing behaviors that are neglectful or detrimental to those needs and would not be otherwise considered. This motivational dynamic has significant consequences for motivation, cognition, behavior, affect, and sociality.

This chapter aims to present the motivational imbalance model of extremism (Kruglanski, Szumowska, Kopetz, et al. 2021) and demonstrate how an approach based on goal systems helps us understand extreme behaviors and identify the common psychological dynamics they share. We start by presenting the motivational imbalance model of extremism and its consequences (for a more detailed discussion, see Kruglanski, Szumowska, & Kopetz 2021]]; Kruglanski, Szumowska, Kopetz, et al. 2021). We will then discuss some of the antecedents of extremism, with a particular focus on individual differences. Specifically, we will present evidence showing that some people personify the dynamics of extremism more than others—the syndrome we call _extreme personality_ (Szumowska et al., 2022)]]—and that this construct can be useful in predicting extreme behaviors across domains.

### Motivational Balance and Imbalance

The concept of extremism stands in contrast to that of moderation. We define the two in terms of goal systemic balance or the lack of it. As acknowledged by the goal systems theory (Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2015]), people have multiple goals; and these goals can be in different relations to one another and to the means of their attainment. Goals stem from basic needs and are in turn linked to behaviors or means that can be used to attain them.

We thus adopt the assumption that humans have basic needs, biological (e.g., the need for nutrition, hydration, rest) and psychogenic (e.g., the need for autonomy, relatedness, understanding, significance) (Deci & Ryan, 2000]]; Fiske, 2010]]; Higgins, 2012]]; Maslow, 1943]]) whose fulfillment is indispensable to their well-being. The very concept of basic needs suggests that people try to satisfy them all and that their non-fulfillment foments distress. The attempt to satisfy all basic needs defines moderation, whereas the dominance of one need over others defines extremism. In other words, moderation represents the balance between one’s basic needs (or the goals serving these needs), whereas extremism represents imbalance wherein one need/goal dominates over others. Conditions for moderation and extremism are schematically represented in Figure 11.1]].

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-032-colour.gif)

Figure 11.1 Graphical representation of moderation (on the left) and extremism (on the right). Under moderation, the individual’s active goals are at comparable magnitudes (represented by the circles’ size), and their mutual constraints reduce the set of activities considered as means to the focal goal (FG). When a means (M3) is inconsistent with one of the alternative goals (AG2), it is not considered as a means to the FG. In contrast, under extremism, the FG exceeds in magnitude all other goals. The latter goals are then inhibited, and the strength of constraints they exercise on means to the FG is reduced. As a result, the set of acceptable means to the FG expands to include now M3 despite it undermining AG2.

_Note_: Means consistent with a given goal are marked with the “+” symbol and means inconsistent with a given goal are marked with the “–” symbol.

#### Balance and Moderation

The several needs exercise constraints on each other such that behaviors that gratify one need while undermining others (the so-called counterfinal behaviors; Kruglanski et al., 2015]]) are typically avoided (see also left panel of Figure 11.1]]). In a series of experiments, Kopetz et al. (2011)]] manipulated the activation of background goals (e.g., diet) and tested how that influences the range of means (e.g., foods) selected to satisfy the focal goal (e.g., eating). The presence of active background goals narrowed the range of means to a focal goal and restricted them to only those that satisfied all active goals. This effect, known as the _multifinality constraint effect_, refers to the notion that a person’s choices are guided by all the goals that are active at a given time. In this instance, one’s hunger may coexist with concerns about taste and health. Therefore, people typically eat foods that are both healthy and tasty, while avoiding foods that are unhealthy or foul-tasting. Similarly, one’s need for relatedness may temper the need for achievement, thus promoting a work–family balance (as opposed to focusing entirely on work, as seen in workaholism).

Importantly, moderation does not imply “moderation” in the magnitude of one’s needs/goals; motivational balance may exist between several high-magnitude needs. For instance, individuals highly motivated to pursue their favorite activity could pursue it in a balanced or harmonious manner or in an imbalanced, obsessive manner (Vallerand, 2015]]; see also Vallerand & Paquette, 2021]]). Both harmoniously and obsessively passionate individuals are equally motivated; however, harmoniously passionate individuals pursue activities that satisfy their other needs, whereas obsessively passionate individuals focus exclusively on their passion at the expense of everything else. For example, one can be very passionate about dancing yet remain involved in other life areas (family, work, etc.). In contrast, another can be passionate about dancing and withdraw from or neglect other life domains, including health (Rip et al., 2006]]).

#### Imbalance and Extremism

At times, the balance gets upset, and one need becomes dominant. This may happen in two general ways. The first is when one of the needs gets aroused to an exaggerated magnitude. Then, all other needs are pushed into the background, and their influence on behavior is diminished (Maslow, 1943]]). This process is possible via the goal-shielding mechanism (Shah et al., 2002]]), whereby a highly salient and important goal cognitively inhibits other goals, decreasing their accessibility and importance.

Alternatively, a motivational imbalance may be created when the saliency of the alternative needs subsides (e.g., because of declined expectancy of satisfying them; Kruglanski et al., 2014]]). In this case, too, the person’s mental resources are channeled disproportionately toward the satisfaction of the focal need and withdrawn from alternative needs.

Under imbalance, the constraints that basic needs exercise upon behavior are relaxed. Consequently, actions that have been normally avoided are now permitted (see the right panel of Figure 11.1]]). For instance, Kopetz et al. (2011)]] looked at the kinds of foods students were considering for lunch. All participants had relatively equal concern for the goals of food enjoyment and weight control. However, when the importance of food enjoyment (relative to other goals such as weight control) was enhanced, participants were willing to consider a higher number of foods, including those that were rated higher on taste but also on caloric content (at odds with the weight-control goal). This shows that under imbalance, when one goal dominates the other concerns, constraints are released, and people are willing to select whatever means satisfy their dominant need even if they undermine the other goals (see also Chapter 2]] in this volume). Extremism reflects these processes: When “insanely” in love, one may sacrifice work, health, and finances to please the object of affection. When on an extreme diet, a person is ready to risk health, career, and social relationships to attain their ideal body image. When consumed by obsessive passion, one may neglect relationships, hobbies, and health. When extremely devoted to a political cause, one may resort to violence to attain a political goal (see Chapter 12]] in this volume).

It is noteworthy that momentary spikes in magnitudes of given needs occur often, resulting in temporary imbalances wherein alternative concerns are temporarily put aside in favor of other salient needs (e.g., one may “drop everything” to attend to an emergency). However, people are typically quick to restore motivational balance. Thus, extremism represents the state when the motivational imbalance endures. Shorter and weaker states of imbalance are not threatening; on the contrary, they are common and represent the sequential pursuit of different goals/needs.

The above suggests that extremism is the result of the regular processes underlying goal pursuit and prioritization. Therefore, the goal systems theory (Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2015]) notions, including _multifinality_ and _counterfinality_, apply to understanding the dynamics of extreme behaviors. From this perspective extreme behaviors are not special and unique, as often believed; rather, they represent the end of a continuum ranging from a (more or less) balanced pursuit of one’s basic needs to a profound imbalance in which one need eclipses others. The ordinary processes (i.e., common to goal pursuit in general) that create motivational imbalances are the processes that explain the emergence of extremism (Kruglanski, Szumowska, Kopetz, et al. 2021). We discuss these processes in the following section.

### Antecedents of Motivational Imbalance

By definition, motivational imbalance happens when a given need dominates others. This dominance can result from the focal need being aroused at an exaggerated magnitude or from the saliency of alternative needs considerably subsiding. When the imbalance endures, extremism occurs. Different factors may play a role in creating the state of such enduring imbalance. They include conditions inherent in the situation and factors immanent to the person.

#### Situational Influences

A long tradition in the psychology of motivation shows that needs may become salient through deprivation or incentivization (see Hull, 1943]]; Spence, 1956]]). Deprivation lowers the need state to below the satisfactory range, whereas incentivization offers an opportunity to increase satisfaction within that range. For instance, humiliation may create a state of esteem deprivation and evoke the motivation to restore it to a satisfactory level. On the other hand, a chance for an outstanding achievement in the professional or interpersonal realm or an opportunity to perform an act of supreme social value presents an incentive that may motivate an action intended to boost one’s self-esteem above its current level (Kruglanski et al., [^2013], [^2018]).

Needs may abate and liberate resources for other pursuits. Studies show that when the expectancy of satisfaction of a given need falls below a threshold, the need wanes (see Kruglanski et al., 2014]]). This will result in the reallocation of resources to other needs or goals that are deemed attainable (see Chapter 9]] in this volume). For instance, when one’s concerns with relatedness are reduced (because of unavailability of interaction partners or seclusion), one might focus entirely on work, which may result in “workaholism” (e.g., Scott et al., 1997]]). Similarly, an individual may overly concentrate on a favorite activity, thus exhibiting obsessive passion (Vallerand, 2015]]). Indeed, Lalande et al. (2017)]] demonstrated that low levels of need satisfaction in an important area of life (e.g., work) or in life in general predicted obsessive (but not harmonious) engagement in an activity about which one was passionate. This suggests that obsessive (i.e., extreme) passion may be a compensatory response to unsatisfied needs. Also, Laurijssen and Leander (see Chapter 9]] in this volume) argue that when unable to satisfy their needs in one domain, people may “jump” to other, seemingly dissociated goal domains that serve the same need or take a “leap” of faith to entirely new pursuits.

Needs may also abate through social influence. For instance, because of ideological “brainwashing,” one may no longer care about physical survival and be more inclined to volunteer for a suicidal mission (Kruglanski et al., 2013]]).

#### Personality Factors

Personal predispositions may also affect one’s tendency to fully commit to a given pursuit to the detriment of others. For instance, people high on the need for cognitive closure (Kruglanski, 2004]]; Kruglanski & Webster, 1996]]) may “seize and freeze” upon an accessible goal and disproportionately channel their resources toward its attainment. Indeed, the need for closure has been linked to an increased focus on a given goal, greater selectivity of attention, and greater inhibition of information irrelevant to the dominant pursuit (e.g., Kossowska, 2007a]], 2007b]]; Pica et al., 2013]]; Szumowska & Kossowska, 2017]]). It has also been associated with greater commitment to one’s worldviews and ideologies (see Kossowska et al., 2020]]).

Whereas states of deprivation or incentivization may generally induce states of imbalance in most people, it is of interest to examine whether there exist individual differences in proneness to such imbalance as we have defined it in our model. To investigate this issue, we have developed the Extreme Personality Scale (Szumowska et al., 2022]]) and tested its relationships with extremisms across domains.

#### Manifestations of Extreme Personality

The Extreme Personality Scale (Szumowska et al., 2022]]) was developed to capture individuals’ tendency to motivational imbalance, namely, dominance of one goal over other goals and the willingness to sacrifice alternative goals for the dominant goal. The scale includes 12 items designed to capture all aspects of extremism—motivational, cognitive, behavioral, and affective (Kruglanski, Szumowska, Kopetz, et al. 2021). Items include “Typically, in my life, there is only one thing that truly matters to me,” “When I devote myself to a goal, everything else becomes insignificant,” “When I focus on my most important goal, I hardly notice anything else,” “I usually invest all of my time and energy into the one thing that matters to me the most,” and “My happiness is closely tied to the one goal I find important” (Szumowska et al., 2022]]). We have validated this scale across 22 studies and more than 9000 participants and demonstrated that people who score high on the scale personify the psychological dynamics of extremism more than others. Specifically, we showed that extreme personality predicted manifestations of extremism at motivational, cognitive, affective, behavioral, and social levels.

##### Motivational Manifestations

Motivational imbalance is seen in the dominance of one need/goal and disproportionate withdrawal from alternative needs/goals. Therefore, the main manifestations of motivational imbalance are extreme commitment to the focal need, the willingness to sacrifice alternative needs for the dominant need, and the willingness to engage in behaviors serving the focal need, including extreme behaviors such as violence. We have found that extreme personality predicts all these manifestations.

###### Increased Commitment to the Focal Need

In a study on dieters (people with a weight-control goal), we found that the Extreme Personality Scale positively predicted the importance of the focal goal. Specifically, the higher the scores on the Extreme Personality Scale, the greater importance participants attached to their weight-control goal, and the more committed they were to it.

###### Willingness to Sacrifice Alternative Needs

Extreme personality was also related to a greater willingness to sacrifice alternative needs for the dominant need. Across five studies, we have found that extreme personality significantly predicted propensity to martyrdom, defined as the willingness to self-sacrifice for a cause and measured with the Self-Sacrifice Scale (Belanger et al., 2014). People scoring high (vs. low) on the Extreme Personality Scale were more willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, that is, to sacrifice their life for a cause they find dear to them.

###### Willingness to Engage in Behaviors Serving the Focal Need

Dominance of one need results in greater willingness to consider extreme means that would not be considered under a balanced state. An extreme means that people typically avoid using is violence. Therefore, another manifestation of extremism would be considering violence as a means to one’s goals. We thus expected that people high on extreme personality should find violence more acceptable if it serves their dominant goal. In line with this notion, we found that the Extreme Personality Scale predicted support for violence in dealing with enemies as measured with the Pro-violence subscale of the Militant Extremism Mindset scale (Stankov et al., 2018]]). This suggests that participants high on extreme personality showed greater support for violence when violence served their dominant goal.

However, extremism is not necessarily related to violence, and we expected that extreme personality should be related to a greater willingness to engage in any activities that serve the person’s focal goal. In the COVID-19 pandemic context, we obtained evidence that people high on extreme personality had stronger intentions to engage in behaviors serving the focal goal of stopping the virus’s spread, such as spending time and money to support stopping the virus’s spread, organizing campaigns to support fighting the pandemic, and volunteering to support medical services. They were also more willing to punish those who did not comply with the pandemic restrictions. These results suggest that extreme personality is related to willingness to engage in behaviors instrumental to the dominant goal.

##### Cognitive Manifestations

The main cognitive manifestations of motivational imbalance comprise an excessive and prolonged focus on objects related to the focal goal (i.e., preoccupation) and obsessive tendencies related to that goal (Kruglanski, Szumowska, Kopetz, et al. 2021).

In line with these notions, we found that higher scores on the Extreme Personality Scale predicted stronger external preoccupation, or “the tendency to maintain external-focus on a specific object” (Sakamoto, 1998]], p. 646).

To capture obsessive tendencies, we tested whether the Extreme Personality Scale predicts engagement in obsessive passion. The dualistic model of passion (Vallerand et al., 2003]]) assumes two types of passion, obsessive and harmonious, which differ in how a person is involved in the favorite activity. With obsessive passion, people experience an uncontrollable urge to partake in the activity they love, sometimes at the expense of other activities in their life. By contrast, with harmonious passion, the activity occupies a significant but not overpowering space in the person’s identity and is internalized in harmony with other self-elements and aspects of the person’s life. Therefore, people engage in the activity they love willingly and flexibly.

In three studies, we found that the Extreme Personality Scale positively and consistently predicted obsessive, but not harmonious, passion across domains of activity, suggesting that people with extreme personality may engage in a passionate activity in a rigid and obsessive (rather than flexible and harmonious) manner. For instance, in a sample of runners, extreme personality predicted obsessive, but not harmonious, passion for running. Similarly, in a sample of people in committed relationships, extreme personality predicted obsessive, but not harmonious, passion for the relationship.

##### Affective Manifestations

At the affective level, the motivational imbalance manifests itself as high emotional dependency on the dominant goal, emotional volatility, and extreme mood swings (low emotional stability; Costa & McCrae, 1992a]]; DeYoung et al., 2007]]; Goldberg, 1992]]). Therefore, we expected the Extreme Personality Scale to correlate negatively with emotional stability (the inverse of neuroticism) and positively with exaggerated emotional reactions in reference to the dominant goal.

In four studies we assessed participants’ extreme personality and their emotional stability with the subscale of the NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992b]]; see Goldberg, 1992]]). As expected, we found a significant negative relationship between the two variables, meaning that extremism is related to lower emotional stability (i.e., greater emotional instability and volatility).

In two other studies, in which we assessed individuals’ reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also found that extreme personality predicted a more extreme emotional reaction to the pandemic such that the more extreme the personality, the greater the mood dependency on the news about the pandemic. Participants high (vs. low) on extreme personality were also more likely to reorganize their lives because of the pandemic, to focus on the pandemic-related news more, and to spend more time thinking about the pandemic.

##### Behavioral Manifestations

Probably the most consequential manifestation of extremism is engagement in extreme behaviors. We, therefore, tested whether extreme personality predicts engagement in extreme behaviors across domains, including dieting, religion, involvement in a cause, relationships, sports, passion, fandom, and substance use.

###### Involvement in Counterfinal Behaviors

Extreme behaviors are counterfinal (Kruglanski et al., 2015]]): They satisfy the dominant goal but undermine the person’s other goals (Kruglanski et al., 2015]]; see also Chapter 2]] in this volume). Counterfinal behaviors are typically avoided. Yet under motivational imbalance, when one need dominates and others become less salient, behavioral concerns are relaxed, and therefore counterfinal behaviors are no longer prohibited. Hence, motivational imbalance promotes engagement in counterfinal actions. If this is the case, extreme personality should positively predict the frequency of engagement in counterfinal behaviors.

Our results show that, indeed, that was the case. In two studies, participants’ frequency of engaging in counterfinal behaviors (including behaviors that are unhealthy or risky, undermine basic physiological needs, are immoral or illegal, break social norms, etc.) was positively related to their scores on the Extreme Personality Scale.

In a study on dieters, we found that extreme personality predicted the use of a greater number of extreme dieting strategies including using “boosters” to achieve the dieting goal (e.g., reaching for laxatives) and abandonment of family meetings where food appears (thus neglecting interpersonal and family-related goals).

###### Involvement in Extreme Behaviors

In a different study, we asked participants about their various goals and the behaviors they engage in to attain these goals. We were particularly interested in the frequency of engagement in extreme and non-extreme behaviors (previously determined in a separate pilot study) that served the goals of interest. We found that extreme personality consistently predicted frequency of engagement in extreme behaviors to attain dieting goals, religious and spiritual goals, romantic goals, substance use–related goals, fighting for a cause, and goals related to being a fan of a group, team, or celebrity.

###### Enlargement of a Means Set

In line with the theory (Kruglanski, Szumowska, Kopetz, et al. 2021), extreme personality also predicted the number of behaviors a person engaged in to pursue the dominant goal (i.e., the size of the means set). For each goal in the study, we counted the number of behaviors (extreme and non-extreme) that a person ever engaged in to pursue a given goal. Consistently across these different goals, extreme personality predicted willingness to consider a higher number of behaviors as instrumental means to one’s goals. This suggests that when the person is highly committed to one goal (dominant need), they are willing to do whatever it takes to attain it.

##### Social Consequences

According to the imbalance theory of extremism (Kruglanski, Szumowska, Kopetz, et al. 2021), extreme behaviors are “infrequent phenomena whose rarity results from a pronounced intensity or magnitude of their underlying motivation” (p. 265). They are thus infrequent and oftentimes regarded as deviant and marginalized. Because of their sacrificial nature (basic needs are neglected and undermined), they are also short-lived. Therefore, extreme personality, as proneness to motivational imbalance, should also be infrequent, associated with non-normative behaviors, and hard to sustain over a long period of time.

###### Infrequency

To test the frequency of extreme personality, we investigated the distribution of the Extreme Personality Scale’s scores. Across different samples, we have found that they typically follow the normal distribution. This means that most people fall in the middle and that only a small portion of participants score very high/low. In fact, only a few percent of participants obtain the extreme values on the scale. This means that highly extreme personality is very infrequent. Figure 11.2]] presents distributions of the Extreme Personality Scale scores across four different samples.

_Note_: Solid thick lines represent means, thicker dashed lines represent one standard deviation below/above the mean, and thinner dashed lines represent two standard deviations below/above the mean. Color intensity represents frequency: The lighter the color, the less frequent the scores.

###### Short-Lived Nature

The imbalance theory of extremism (Kruglanski, Szumowska, Kopetz, et al. 2021) also suggests that imbalance is hard to sustain. Thus, the propensity to purse one’s goals in an imbalanced way represented by extreme personality should require a great deal of energy and should be hard to sustain. Accordingly, younger people (whose energy level is presumably high) should be more likely to exhibit extreme personality than older ones; the latter should pursue their goals in a more balanced way. Indeed, across multiple samples from several countries (including the United States, Poland, Italy, Argentina, and Indonesia) we found a negative correlation between extreme personality and age, providing initial evidence that extreme personality, and therefore the tendency toward motivational imbalance, may decrease with age.

###### Non-Normativity

Extremism is often associated with the use of extreme means that are shunned by society (e.g., violence) and considered deviant and non-normative. We conducted one study with a sample of participants in non-normative relationships that may come with a social stigma (i.e., bondage and discipline, domination and submission, sadism and masochism [BDSM]). We compared this group with participants in normative (egalitarian) relationships matched on basic demographic variables (nationality, gender, and age). As expected, we found that the BDSM community scored higher on the Extreme Personality Scale than their counterparts, thus providing initial evidence that extreme personality may be related to non-normative behaviors often sanctioned by the mainstream society.

### Summary and Future Research Directions

Though diverse in their manifestations, extreme behaviors share uniform psychological dynamics. This dynamic can be described in terms of goal systemic balance or the lack of it. Specifically, we propose that extremism results from motivational imbalance wherein a given need becomes dominant to the extent of overriding other basic concerns. The constraints that the latter typically exert on behavior are relaxed, allowing actions that are neglectful or detrimental to those concerns. The result is an expansion of behavioral options for addressing the prioritized end and engagement in extreme behaviors forbidden under the state of balance. This means that people engage in extreme behaviors that the majority avoid (see Kruglanski, Szumowska, Kopetz, et al. 2021).

Our perspective of extremism is based on the basic principles of goal pursuit proposed by the goal systems theory (Kruglanski et al., [^2002], [^2015]). The theory specifies the manner in which people’s goals and means are structured within different configurations (e.g., multifinal, equifinal, counterfinal), with important implications for actions in general and for understanding the emergence of extreme behavior in particular. The focus on structure, rather than content, of goals and means allows for a unifying framework that emphasizes the common psychological dynamics and motivational mechanism underlying extreme behaviors across domains: violent extremism, extreme humanitarianism, extreme dieting, addictions, extreme passions, and extreme activism. The basic notions of multifinality, counterfinality, and goal shielding that allow us to understand behavior in general also afford insights into people’s willingness to engage in actions that undermine their own and others’ basic needs. For instance, in a state of balance, people restrict their behavior to actions that allow the satisfaction (or at least do not interfere with it) of all the needs that are salient and important (the multifinality constraint effect; Kopetz et al., 2011]]). However, when one need becomes relatively more important than the others, a state of imbalance is created through a process of goal shielding whereby the most important need actively inhibits the other needs (Shah et al., 2002]]). As a result, multifinality constraints are released, and behaviors that are otherwise not considered (e.g., counterfinal behaviors that interfere with the pursuit of some goals) are now allowed (see also Chapter 2]] in this volume).

These findings are consistent with recent developments in the decision-making literature showing that when people balance their goals, they use mixed (moderate) solutions for resolving trade-offs in choice. In contrast, when they highlight one goal (motivational imbalance state), they adopt extreme solutions. The latter include seeking consistency (rather than variety) and avoiding (rather than seeking) compromises (see Shaddy et al., 2021]], for a review).

Our chapter discussed some of the situational and individual factors that facilitate motivational imbalance and thus extremism. Situational factors include conditions that give rise to exaggerated arousal of a focal need or to abatement of alternative needs (e.g., by the unavailability of means to satisfy alternative needs).

We focused our discussion of individual differences in proneness to motivational imbalance on “extreme personality” (Szumowska et al., 2022)]]. We presented evidence that extreme personality predicts manifestations of extremism at different levels. Among other things, it predicts a greater commitment to the focal goal, greater willingness to self-sacrifice for a cause (Belanger et al., 2014), and more positive evaluations of activities serving the focal need, including (but not limited to) violence. It is also associated with cognitive preoccupation (Sakamoto, 1998]]) and obsessive passion (Vallerand, 2015]]; Vallerand et al., 2003]]). At the level of affect, extreme personality is linked to emotional instability and volatility and predicts a more extreme emotional reaction to the focal concern.

Extreme personality also predicts people’s willingness to do whatever it takes to satisfy their dominant needs; people high in extreme personality consider a larger number of behaviors in the service of their important goals and report greater frequency of engagement in counterfinal/extreme behaviors across domains (e.g., dieting, religion, involvement in a cause, relationships, sports, passion, fandom, and substance use).

Overall, these findings suggest that extreme personality is a meaningful individual variable that can help predict extreme behaviors across domains. However, there are still some important questions concerning this construct. One particularly intriguing issue is the antecedents of extreme personality.

#### Antecedents of Extreme Personality

As with other personality traits, extreme personality can result from an interaction of biological and situational factors. Personality traits show substantial heritability, with at least 40%–50% of their variance stemming from genetic sources (Bouchard, 1994]]; Loehlin, 1992]]; Reimann et al., 1997]]).

Situational factors can have a significant contribution too. Studies on passion show that obsessive (but not harmonious) passion was predicted by low levels of psychological need satisfaction in important life domains (Lalande et al., 2017]]), suggesting that obsessive passion can develop as a compensatory response to unsatisfied needs (see also Chapter 9]] in this volume). It is thus possible that extreme personality develops due to chronically unsatisfied needs in important domains of life. In such a case, a person can learn to overly rely on one particular goal as a source of satisfaction. This would imply that environments that do not afford satisfaction of one’s basic needs can lead to the development of extreme personality. So possibly early childhood experiences and parenting styles that reinforce reliance on one pursuit as a source of satisfaction may predispose one to the development of extreme personality.

It is also possible that culture can facilitate the development of extreme personality. According to the motivational imbalance theory (Kruglanski, Szumowska, Kopetz, et al. 2021), extremism entails the relaxation of constraints exercised by alternative needs on behaviors serving the prioritized need. Therefore, cultures that are very “loose” and do not impose constraints on a person’s behavior (e.g., in the form of social norms) might contribute to the development of extreme personality (see Gelfand, 2018]]). At the same time, extremely tight environments may hinder people’s ability to satisfy their basic needs and thus contribute to extreme personality through a different process. This suggests that extreme cultures (i.e., cultures lying at the extremes of the tightness–looseness continuum) can promote the development of extreme personality.

Research also suggests that _narratives_ (beliefs about ends and means) that are supported and validated by one’s social _network_ (in-group) play a crucial role in creating and maintaining motivational imbalance and extremism (e.g., Kruglanski et al., 2019]]). Therefore, it is likely that a long-lasting and exclusive exposure to imbalance-promoting networks and narratives that emphasize a single-minded focus on one need (e.g., highly orthodox communities) can be conducive to the development of extreme personality. These varied possibilities could be profitably explored in future research.

#### What Is the Function of Extreme Personality?

Across several studies, we found that extreme personality predicts engagement in extreme behaviors. Is this good or bad? We suggest that it is neither. The outcomes of extreme behaviors can be either antisocial and destructive or prosocial and highly socially desirable. Terrorism, violence, and extreme greed are harmful and, rightly so, condemned by the mainstream society. On the other hand, extreme humanitarianism or devotion to a cause and exceptional scientific or artistic achievements are highly desirable, honored, and praised. They can push society forward and initiate a change for the better. Our approach emphasizes general processes that are blind to the outcomes, and our findings suggest that extreme personality predicts extremism regardless of its different manifestations.

Thus, these findings raise an interesting question. What is the function of such behaviors? Why did our repertoire of behaviors evolve to include extremism? In some circumstances, extreme behavior is necessary and even indispensable. When coping with an emergency, dropping everything to attend exclusively to the emergency may be the most reasonable action, even if it involves extreme actions such as jumping in front of a car to save a child. People high on extreme personality are more likely to prioritize an emergency to a greater extent. From this perspective, our heroes who sacrifice for the greater good and make our society better are extremists.

At the individual level, extremism (characterized by a narrow focus on one need at the expense of others) could promote ill-being, maladaptation, depression, faster burnout, etc. (Iyengar et al., 2006]]; Schwartz et al., 2002]]; Vallerand & Paquette, 2021]]). On the other hand, it may result in intense states of elation and happiness in relation to outstanding achievements, extraordinary performance, and exceptionality (see Iyengar et al., 2006]]).

Although many extreme behaviors are studied for their positive or negative outcomes, our theoretical approach and preliminary findings suggest that it may be more beneficial if future research continues to explore these ideas, emphasizes the commonalities across behaviors associated with both positive and negative outcomes, and understands the function of extremism for the individual and the society.

Political Behavior from the Perspective of the Goal Systems Theory](04_Contents1.xhtml#n0013)

Katarzyna Jaśko

Politically motivated actions can range from making an inconsequential comment on social media to setting a bomb in a suicide terrorist attack. It might thus seem inadequate to propose one theoretical framework to address cases as diverse as these extreme examples and anything in the space between them. Moreover, models that are typically applied to explain these behaviors include factors that belong to the same socio-political domain. For instance, popular theoretical models include variables such as the characteristics of the political system, the role of political elites, attitudes toward the political issues, and group identities. In contrast to these domain-specific approaches, in this chapter I will analyze behaviors such as expressing political opinions, engaging in protest, and using political violence from a general motivational perspective.

My goal is to demonstrate the usefulness of the goal systems theory (Kruglanski et al., 2002) for understanding political behaviors. Drawing on this framework, I propose that political behavior can be conceptualized as a means to a goal (or multiple goals) and that, as such, it should be guided by the same motivational principles as other non-political behaviors. In other words, people donate money, attend protests, vote, or join extremist groups because by doing so they hope to achieve some valuable outcomes. If that is true, then intentions to engage in political behavior should depend on the importance of those outcomes, expectancy of their successful attainment, and perceived instrumentality of the particular behavior. In this chapter, I will explore how well these general principles apply to the political domain, summarize available empirical evidence, and identify gaps in the existing literature as well as promising directions for future research.

### The Importance of Goal Importance

According to the fundamental principle shared by all motivational models, including goal systems theory (Kruglanski, Jasko, et al., 2015), people commit to and strive for goals that are important to them. People aim at achieving desirable future states such as being successful at work or finding an attractive partner. They also act to avoid undesirable states such as when they lock their door to avoid robbery or follow fitness routines to stay healthy. When applied to the political domain it would lead to a relatively straightforward prediction that political issues perceived as more important should motivate greater commitment and engagement than causes perceived as less important. In this section I will first address the question of why people perceive some political causes as more important than other issues and whether these perceptions are indeed related to their political behaviors. Second, I will examine a more complex picture of the relationship between cause importance and political behavior using the insights from goal systems theory.

Starting with the simple version of the relationship between goal importance and political engagement, it is indeed not that difficult to find evidence demonstrating that more motivationally invested individuals are more likely to become politically active than people with less intense commitment to the cause. Whereas past studies on goals that motivate political engagement range from those focused on specific issues to research exploring the role of abstract values, they can be summarized under several more general categories. The first major motivational factor that has frequently been associated with political engagement is a sense of relative deprivation (Gurr, 2015]]). In line with control theories (e.g., Carver & Scheier, 1982]]), a discrepancy between what people feel they deserve and what they actually get can be a potent source of motivation for political action. An extensive meta-analysis (Smith et al., 2012]]) confirms a positive relationship between a sense of deprivation and political action, and more recent research also demonstrates its role in support for extreme political behaviors (Obaidi et al., 2019]]). Of particular relevance is a sense of collective deprivation, which occurs when people feel that their important group suffers from a disadvantaged position or lack of respect that they feel it deserves (Golec de Zavala et al., 2019]]; Jasko et al., 2020]]). A sense of collective injustice is often prompted by strong identification with the group that is a subject of the suffering (Agostini & van Zomeren, 2021]]; Van Zomeren et al., 2008]]). The relationship between group identity and political engagement becomes stronger when the group identity takes a politicized form and when it is accompanied by anger. However, people become politically active not only because their personal or collective conditions prompt the sense of grievances. They often engage in actions in solidarity with other people including those who belong to out-groups. The source of motivation in this case often involves threats to fundamental moral values that apply across the group boundaries. Research on moral convictions (Skitka & Bauman, 2008]]) and sacred values (Atran & Ginges, 2012]]) converges on the conclusion that when people feel their values are under threat they are more likely to engage in political action. That happens even when such engagement puts them in conflict with their group commitments. According to these theoretical approaches, a difference between values considered as sacred and other goals is qualitative rather than simply a difference in magnitude.

Whereas this literature offers support for the role of desirability of political goals, it quickly becomes clear that it is not enough that people say a cause is important to them for them to actually get involved in actions on behalf of it. The size of the gap between acknowledgment of cause importance and behavioral engagement for the cause is often quite substantial. For instance, in one study on the mobilization for a peace demonstration (Klandermans & Oegma, 1987), only 5% of those who agreed with the goals of the protest eventually participated in it. Even among those who intended to go, only 40% actually went to the demonstration. The results of our recent study focused on climate activism demonstrate a similar gap (Jasko et al., 2021]]). In that study, we measured the importance of the goal of fighting climate change. The overall agreement among participants was that climate change was a serious threat and a very important problem. We also measured willingness to engage in actions for this cause such as joining a demonstration or volunteering for an activist organization. The importance of the problem was strongly (_r_ > .60) correlated with these intentions, which seems to be highly consistent with research referenced earlier. However, at the end of the study we gave participants an opportunity to get involved in a set of actions for the cause. Specifically, we told them that in collaboration with a climate activist organization we were conducting a week-long activist challenge during which they could sign up for up to seven tasks that would help that organization achieve its activist goals. Participants could volunteer for however many tasks they wanted. In contrast to the overwhelming general willingness to get involved in climate actions reported earlier in that study, a majority of people did not sign up for any task. Moreover, over the next week less than one-third of the people who committed themselves to doing something actually engaged in the tasks they volunteered to do. Finally, the correlation between goal importance and the actual involvement in any action for the cause was below .20, which is a much less impressive result than the correlation between the goal importance and their general intentions.

Our finding is perfectly consistent with the results of opinion polls, which systematically show that many more people agree on the importance of social problems than are willing to actually do something to solve them. The question is whether such a gap between goal importance and behavior is unique to political behavior. The answer offered by decades of research on the psychology of self-regulation is negative. Multiple studies demonstrated similar gaps in domains such as health, work, relationships, and moral behaviors, among many others (Sheeran, 2002]]). While it does not diminish the importance of the overall issue, it suggests that more universal mechanisms might be at play. What could those mechanisms be then?

The important insight from goal systems theory is that the entire network of goals should be taken into account when trying to predict political (or any other) behaviors. Therefore, it is not enough if somebody says that a goal of fighting climate change is very important for them. This goal should be also either more important than their alternative concerns that are chronically or situationally activated or easily integrated with them, allowing a behavior to be multifinal. For example, a person whose friends are members of an activist organization may find it easier to get involved since not only their political goals but also their relationship needs will be satisfied. In contrast, if there is a conflict between the goals, a less important goal will have to yield. For instance, a participant in our study might have avoided the activist challenge because the climate change problem—while very important when considered in isolation—subsided when confronted with everyday life filled with other commitments. This highlights the importance of considering the full motivational structure rather than focusing on a single goal (Kung & Scholer, 2021]]). It also means that the more demanding or difficult to integrate action is, the greater the role of relative importance of the political cause might also be.

What kind of evidence is there to support these ideas? One line of research that is relevant here is research on the role of biographical availability for political engagement. This construct refers to the lack of constraints that would increase the costs and risks associated with political engagement (McAdam, 1986]]). These may include factors such as financial concerns, time required for the involvement, and exposure to dangerous situations. In the motivational vocabulary they denote alternative goals that a person pursues. Specific commitments that are typically examined in this research include marriage, having children, and being fully employed in a job that does not offer flexibility (Bunnage, 2014]]). Indeed, research offers evidence that these alternative concerns might indeed be associated with lower chances of getting politically involved. One example could be a study on participants of Freedom Summer, which was an activist project aimed at increasing the number of registered Black voters in Mississippi in 1964. McAdam (1986)]] analyzed the applications of volunteers who had signed up for the project, including both those who eventually went to Mississippi and those who had volunteered but never went there. He found that, in comparison to a general population, all volunteers in this project were more likely to be young, unmarried, unemployed, and childless.

However, the comparison of the two groups complicates the picture of the relationship between biographical availability and activism as the differences between them were less straightforward than those between all volunteers and the general public. Moreover, closer inspection of other studies on biographical availability also offers inconsistent evidence (Beyerlein & Hipp, 2006]]). Even though some studies find a negative relationship between political participation and being married, having a full-time job, or having children (e.g., Petrie, 2004]]), other studies do not find it (e.g., Nepstad & Smith, 1999]]; Wiltfang & McAdam, 1991]]). One possible explanation of the inconsistencies in the research on biographical availability following from the goal systems theory is that it is the type of relationship between goals that matters. For instance, if both partners are committed to the same political cause and they can simultaneously achieve their activist goals and their relationship goals, then there is no reason to expect a negative relationship between being married and political engagement. More generally, it means that whereas taking alternative goals into account is an important and much needed step toward better understanding of political engagement, it may not be enough. Researchers of political behavior should not only include measures of alternative goals in the study but also pay attention to the specific—conflicting or facilitating—relationships between the political goal and alternative goals. It could be expected that individuals who see greater integration between their political goals and other life concerns would be more likely to initiate and maintain their engagement than those who experience frequent trade-offs.

A research area that highlights the role of relations between goals and how well or poorly integrated they are is the literature on passion. This research typically distinguishes two types of passion, harmonious and obsessive (Vallerand, 2010]]). Both are related to stronger importance attached to the activity. However, whereas harmonious passion represents the important goal that is well integrated with other goals and does not result in conflict, obsessive passion refers to a situation when the activity one is passionate about overtakes other goals. As such, it represents an imbalanced goal structure. Several studies have examined the consequences of both types of passion for engagement in political actions. For instance, a study conducted among Quebec sovereignty activists showed that both types of passion were related to greater willingness to get involved in actions for a cause (Rip et al., 2012]]). However, the difference occurred with regard to the type of actions individuals with different types of passion were willing to engage in. Whereas those with harmonious passion were more interested in democratic and peaceful forms of activism, those with obsessive passion favored extreme and aggressive actions. The same pattern of results was obtained with regard to other types of political causes including environmental causes, engagement in a political party, and religious causes (Belanger et al., 2019; Gousse-Lessard et al., 2013]]). In short, this research shows that relative goal importance contributes to greater willingness to get involved. The differences between the types of goal structures (well-integrated or imbalanced) are related to specific kinds of actions that a person considers. Recent work on extreme personality (Szumowska et al., 2022) also shows that people who are prone to favoring a single goal over alternative goals are more likely to support and get involved in more extreme forms of activism for a cause.

Importantly, the demands and costs of an imbalanced goal structure might lead to such a structure being difficult to maintain over the long run. Telling in that regard is research on activist burnout and disengagement from social movements (Gorski & Chen, 2015]]), which shows that disengagement often is a result of unsustainable commitment and large sacrifices for the movement. Similarly, research on passion for a cause demonstrated that volunteers for causes (e.g., humanitarian missions) who were obsessively passionate were more likely to experience negative health consequences of their engagement than those with well-integrated passion (St-Louis et al., 2016). Self-neglect was one of the mechanisms that mediated this process.

In short, whereas several areas of research related to political goals offer confirming evidence that the importance of such goals matters, there is a need to consider a wider network of interconnected goals (political and non-political) in order to make more precise predictions about political behavior.

### Goal Expectancy

Another main assumption of the majority of motivational models, including goal systems theory, is that people engage in pursuit of goals to the extent that they think they can succeed in achieving them (Feather, 1982]]). The impact of feasibility considerations on goal commitment and behavioral engagement has been demonstrated in domains such as educational achievement (Wigfield, 1994]]; Xiang et al., 2003]]) and organizational context (Feather, 1992]]), among many others. Research on individual differences in self-efficacy has similarly shown that this factor significantly contributes to persistence and eventual success in goal pursuit (Bandura, 1977]]). Laypeople also agree that a person is more rational when they pursue attainable rather than unattainable goals (Kruglanski, Jasko, et al., 2015) and that it is more meaningful when one tries to accomplish a desirable outcome using instrumental rather than inadequate means (Tilburg et al., 2013). In this section, I will address the question of how this general tendency plays out in the domain of political behavior and what insights into the role of expectancy for political behavior can be gained from the application of goal systems theory.

Past research on social movements has often examined expectancy in a form of collective efficacy (Van Zomeren et al., 2008]]). This construct refers to a sense that a collective cause can be achieved through joint action. The slogan used by the 2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign, “Yes we can,” is one particularly vivid example of the appeal to collective efficacy. It has been identified in past research as a positive predictor of activist intentions and other political behaviors. For instance, Wegemer (2021)]] found that civic behaviors among youth were higher when both efficacy and value of the cause were high. A systematic meta-analysis that included collective efficacy along with the sense of injustice and social identity found it to be a unique and positive predictor of collective action (Agostini & van Zomeren, 2021]]; Van Zomeren et al., 2008]]). In our own research conducted among participants of a teachers’ strike in Poland, we found that positive expectations toward the outcomes of a future strike were a strong predictor of willingness to participate in it (Grzymala-Moszczynska et al., 2021]]). It would thus seem that perceived attainability indeed works in the same way in the context of a political cause as it does in other life domains.

However, there are multiple examples of studies that yielded non-significant results when it comes to collective efficacy (e.g., Schofield & Pavelchak, 1989]]; Stürmer & Simon, 2004]]), showing that people are willing to act despite lack of belief that their action will change anything. Moreover, even when the correlations between collective efficacy and collective action intentions are significant, they do not seem to be particularly strong. Others have found moderators of this relationship. For example, Cohen-Chen and Van Zomeren (2018)]] showed that group efficacy beliefs predicted collective action only when hope was high but that it was non-significant when people did not have hope. Studies also showed that experiences of failure do not necessarily discourage people from acting for a cause (Cocking & Drury, 2004]]) and may even encourage them to engage in more radical actions (Louis et al., 2021]]). Finally, when looking at historical examples of political actions, it is not that rare to find cases when the probability of success was extremely low or completely absent wherein participants were fully aware of those odds at the time of their actions and they acted regardless. For instance, the analysis of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, a dramatic act of Jewish resistance during World War II, led Einwohner (2003, p.652]]) to conclude that “collective action in the Warsaw Ghetto emerged not in response to opportunity but to a lack thereof; in fact, it was only once the ghetto fighters became aware of the hopelessness of their situation that they began to plan for resistance_._” On a much less dramatic scale, in almost every election some people vote on unpopular candidates in an act that is well known in advance to make no difference in terms of electoral outcomes.

More generally, there are good reasons to suspect that low or highly uncertain chances of success are a norm in the political domain rather than an exception. First, political outcomes are rarely under the control of an individual person. For example, it is highly unlikely that one person’s vote will be decisive in electing a desirable candidate. Also uncertain is whether the candidate’s actions, once they’re elected, will bring about the actual outcomes their voters really cared about. Similarly, the success of a protest depends in large part on whether other people participate (Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011]]) and on the responsiveness of the system (Cichocka et al, 2018]]). Moreover, the chances that the political causes that activists fight for will find complete resolution in the foreseeable future are extremely small, if not null. In short, it seems that the political domain is characterized by relatively high uncertainty and low controllability in comparison to other, non-political goals that people typically pursue. What could then explain commitment to goals and engagement in actions that may have no visible results during one’s lifetime?

#### Expectancy of What Goal?

The first answer refers to the idea directly following from goal systems theory, namely that political actions frequently serve multiple goals (i.e., they are multifinal). Thus, even when the actions of an activist seem futile to an external observer because they do not have any impact on policymakers or do not create a meaningful social change, they may still be considered successful by the actor if they help them attain their alternative goals. What could those other goals be? In the case of political behaviors, they could include the satisfaction of psychological needs such as the need to belong to a group of like-minded people (Van Bavel & Pereira, 2018]]), achieving personal significance (Kruglanski al., 2022), or confirming one’s deeply held beliefs. To satisfy some of those psychological goals, mere engagement and showing up might be enough even when there are no expectations of external rewards outside of the political act itself. In a more extreme version of this motivational structure, a person engages in action not because of the rewards the action brings but because the counterfactual of doing nothing seems to be even more aversive. An extreme and poignant example of such a framing is an excerpt from the memoirs of one of the participants of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising: “people in the ghetto finally realized death was certain to come sooner or later, and that there was nothing to lose by resisting. . . . Everyone knew the chance of victory was zero, but winning wasn’t the goal. We just wanted to die with dignity” (Einwohner, 2003]], p. 667). The counterfactual that encourages engagement despite negative expectations of success might also include the predicted negative reactions of significant others to one’s inaction or contempt from other citizens who participated in the elections.

In support of this idea, research by Hornsey et al. (2006)]] showed that both members and non-members of activist organizations conditioned their future engagement on attaining multiple goals through their participation in the protest. Importantly, expectancy of influencing decision makers was not the most important (or even a significant) predictor of their intentions. The researchers found that for non-members it was the expectancy of expressing important values and influencing the general public that was predictive of their willingness to participate in a future protest. In contrast, for members of an organization, the perceived effectiveness of building a social movement predicted their future intentions. Similarly, research on the willingness to attend union meetings (Flood, 1993]]) showed that while the expectancy of the impact of the meeting was a significant predictor of the intentions to participate, it was not the only one and not even the most important one. Other expectations, such as having a say in union affairs, were more central. These findings are consistent with our own research on personal significance gained from participation in political movements (Jasko et al., 2019]]). Studies conducted among engaged activists showed that when people acted on behalf of important social values, they gained a sense of personal significance and that, as a result, they were more willing to self-sacrifice for the cause in the future. This occurred regardless of their expectations of future successes of their protest, which in many cases were very low. Overall, these results show that success (and its respective expectancy) can be defined in various ways depending on goals that people associate with their political engagement.

#### Importance More Important Than Expectancy

Another explanation for why the likelihood of success might not be included in calculations about political actions could be that the importance of the cause is a much more decisive factor. There are several theoretical reasons for this. First, it could be that when people think about morally charged issues, especially when they involve sacred values (Atran & Ginges, 2012]]), probabilistic concerns are less salient. In support of this, Ginges and Atran (2011)]] investigated the role of deontological versus instrumental thinking in making judgments about war. The results of six studies showed that when people were making decisions about war, their decisions were relatively insensitive to costs or other negative consequences. These findings show that critical decisions in highly moralized political domains (e.g., about war) might not be affected by instrumental concerns. Interestingly, judgments about negotiations were impacted by the manipulated costs. This could suggest that decisions about extreme moral circumstances such as war and political violence activate an imbalanced goal structure that privileges a given goal regardless of the costs that come with it.

Another possible mechanism that could lead to the neglect of expectancy may be the differences in temporal perspective one takes with respect to the political cause. As mentioned earlier, problems such as climate change, economic inequalities, or minority discrimination cannot be realistically expected to be solved in the near future. In line with that observation, our research conducted in the context of numerous protests and social issues in recent years consistently found that activists had different short-term and long-term expectations of success (Jasko et al., 2019]]). While they did not expect positive outcomes in a short time and were rather pessimistic about the immediate effects, their expectation of success in the long run was high. In one recent study conducted among almost 1000 Polish activists, their estimated probability of the success of their cause in the short term was 35%, which could be contrasted with the estimated 66% probability of success in the long term (Jasko et al., 2022]]).

Why should temporal perspective matter for the role of expectancy? According to construal-level theory (Liberman & Trope, 1998]]), distance to the goal changes the relative importance of desirability and attainability concerns because it makes different features of the goal salient. Specifically, research shows that when people think about goals that are in the distant future, the desirability becomes a more important factor guiding their actions, while the role of attainability decreases. In contrast, when people think about outcomes that are closer in time, both desirability and attainability play a role. In the context of political behavior, this could mean that when people think about long-term outcomes of their actions the fact that those outcomes seem to be highly uncertain or unlikely to be attained might not matter as much because of the inflated weight of goal importance. Therefore, if activists are predominantly focused on long-term goals, the focus on desirability may keep them engaged because they do not condition their commitment on short-term outcomes, which often result in failures. Paraphrasing Alexander Hamilton’s words from the musical defining what legacy is (Miranda, 2015]]), activists are planting seeds in a garden that they never get to see. Paradoxically, that might in fact encourage them to act.

A final moderating factor that could be relevant with regard to the relative weight placed on importance and expectancy might be the mindset that people take when thinking about an issue. Of particular relevance here is the distinction between prevention focus and promotion focus. Past research in non-political domains showed that under the prevention focus people are more likely to be guided by importance and to neglect expectancy, but that changes under the promotion mindset (Shah & Higgins, 1997]]). Inspired by these findings, Zaal and colleagues (2011) examined the moderating role of prevention versus promotion focus for political intentions. They showed that when people were in the promotion focus, the perceived likelihood of the success of a protest was positively related to their commitment to collective action. However, under a prevention focus, the chances of success did not matter for people who considered the goal to be important because they were willing to get involved in actions for the cause regardless of the outcome. These findings suggest that when the cause is framed in prevention terms (e.g., acting against a looming threat as opposed to fighting for a better world), expectancy of success might be less relevant. Importantly, this type of situation is probably more frequent in the political realm.

This short overview shows that the role of expectancy for political actions, while consistent with the motivational theories, may be more complicated than the simple linear relationship often assumed in the research on collective efficacy. Next, I will look into the role of another aspect related to expectations, namely the question of instrumentality of particular political actions.

### Instrumentality of Political Actions

A central tenet of goal systems theory is that goals are linked to means and that people use means to pursue goals according to their perceived instrumentality, which denotes the expectation that a given behavior will help attain the goal. For example, a person with a goal of losing weight will engage in dieting only if they perceive this behavior to be an effective way to reach their goal. In contrast, if they do not have such a belief and consider exercising as a more instrumental way to lose weight, they should not be expected to follow a diet.

In the political domain, this would mean that it is not enough that a cause (e.g., women’s rights) is important to an individual. This person should also believe that a behavior such as signing a petition, joining a demonstration, or volunteering for a feminist organization will indeed contribute to promoting the women’s cause. Instrumentality describes a link between a given means and a particular goal and, as such, should be considered separately with regard to multiple goals. For instance, signing a petition might be perceived as moderately instrumental with regard to the goal of convincing the politicians in the government, but it might be considered highly instrumental to a goal of signaling one’s commitment to the cause. Moreover, according to the theory, perceptions of instrumentality in part depend on the number of available means such that a greater number of them results in diluted usefulness of each single means in a set (Belanger et al., 2015). Therefore, the perceived instrumentality of a political protest should also depend on the overall number of actions available to a person in addition to the protest. The hypothesis would be that when people have multiple ways to act for their cause, perceived effectiveness of each of the means is lower.

Surprisingly, little past research compared the instrumentality of specific political actions and their impact on people’s willingness to get involved in them. The majority of existing work focuses on the comparison of violent and peaceful political actions. It is an interesting case because there is evidence, both experimental (Feinberg et al., 2020]]) and from real-world, historical cases (Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011]]), suggesting that political violence is objectively less effective in comparison to peaceful protests. Moreover, under the majority of circumstances, support for violent actions is generally low, so it is informative to examine the conditions under which this support may increase. Applying the instrumentality logic, some of the research tested the idea that violence could be justified as a tactic used by activists if it is perceived as the only means they have to pursue their cause.

Indeed, people are more likely to support violence when they see that alternative means are beyond their reach or non-existent. For instance, participants, who were exposed to videos about two activist groups supporting the same cause, one violent and one peaceful, were less supportive of the violent group than those who were not presented with a peaceful alternative (Schumpe et al., 2018]]). The mediating mechanism was the reduced perceived instrumentality of the violent group when the alternative was present. Similarly, Tausch et al. (2011)]] found that the endorsement of violent collective action was greater when the perceived efficacy of the in-group to redress injustice by non-violent means was low. Finally, when observers attribute the use of violence to desperation and a lack of better alternatives, they may become more sympathetic to the activists’ cause. In a series of studies, Orazani (2020) showed that if people are aware of a history of activist attempts which has progressed from peaceful but ineffective actions to violence, they are more likely to accept a violent choice than when violence was the only strategy ever tried by the activists. One of the mechanisms of increased support was the perception of violent strategies as the last resort. Overall, this research shows that typically low support for violent means could be increased when violence is perceived as relatively more effective means to achieve political goals than peaceful actions. However, there is also some evidence suggesting that when aggressive collective action is perceived to be efficacious, the perceived efficacy of peaceful collective action may not matter that much (Saab et al., 2016]]). If that is the case, under some circumstances violent means could be chosen even when peaceful actions were perceived to be equally instrumental.

Outside of the comparison of violent and non-violent actions it is difficult to find examples of research that focused on the instrumentality considerations, their underpinnings, and their consequences. One example from our research examining the role of instrumentality is a study that compared the perceptions of climate actions by activists and non-activists (Jasko et al., 2021]]). Specifically, we were interested in whether perceptions of effectiveness of different actions addressing the problem of climate change could explain differences between activists and non-activists. When it comes to environmental actions, three types are typically distinguished: private-sphere individual actions (e.g., reducing meat consumption), public-sphere collective actions (e.g., demonstrations or volunteering for activist organizations), and public individual actions (e.g., support for certain environmental policies). We focused on the comparison between the first two categories because even though social change requires pressuring decision makers through collective actions, the majority of people involved in environmental actions seem to be predominantly engaged in individual actions such as recycling, and they largely refrain from collective actions. We wanted to check whether differences in one’s level of activist engagement might be related to perceived instrumentality of those two types of actions and therefore impacted willingness to get involved in them in the future. To that aim, we recruited people with varying levels of past activist involvement. We measured their willingness to get involved in individual and collective actions in the future and their perceived effectiveness of those actions. We found that, regardless of the type of an action (individual or collective), perceived instrumentality of the actions in fighting climate change was strongly related to future intentions to get involved in them. Moreover, we found that, whereas activists perceived both individual and collective actions as highly instrumental, non-activists perceived collective actions to be less effective than individual actions. Finally, whereas activists were more likely to engage in both individual and collective actions, non-activists were more likely to engage in individual than collective actions.

What are the implications of considering instrumentality judgments for political engagement? The first implication is that it is important to establish whether people know which means are instrumental to achieve the goals of their cause. This could in part explain why despite the fact that the majority of people agree that climate change is an important concern that requires action, very few people do anything beyond recycling. In an international poll, 55% of participants said that the reason behind their inaction was that they were missing information and clear guidance (Bohlender et al., 2021]]). One reason behind the impact of activists such as Greta Thunberg would be that they provide people with examples of the specific ways in which they might engage in protest.

Another implication could be that people might misassess the effectiveness of different means. Future research should investigate why people have those perceptions. One option is that they are based on inaccurate information that could be corrected by providing people with more reliable facts. However, it could also be a result of motivated reasoning such that people are unwilling to invest more effort in the cause, and their attributions to low effectiveness serve as justifications. This interpretation would be consistent with the poll on climate change actions (Bohlender et al., 2021]]). The poll found that actions perceived as the most important to address climate change were reducing waste and increasing recycling, which are at the same time the least effortful means. They were followed by solutions that did not require effort on the part of individual citizens. In contrast, objectively more effective but at the same time more demanding actions such as using public transport, reducing air travel, and reducing meat consumption attracted fewer than one-third of surveyed participants.

Finally, as the direct application of goal systems theory, the role of the number of means for a political goal could be investigated as these predictions have not been previously applied to the political context. For example, a comparison of the effects of having multiple versus fewer means, examining the effects of engaging in counterfinal means, and measuring the role of equifinal versus multifinal means could all be fruitful avenues for future research on political engagement. Research also suggests that not only the number of means but also their variety plays an important role (Etkin, see Chapter 7]] in this volume). Applying this insight to the political domain could inspire studies on how different—rather than just multiple—actions of activists may increase political engagement among observers.

While so far I have discussed the central constructs from the goal systems theory and how they could be applied to the political domain, in the next section I will look at the factor that occupies a major role in existing accounts of political behavior, namely social context. I will propose several ways in which motivational accounts could be used to illuminate the psychological mechanisms behind the importance of this factor.

### Social Context and Political Engagement

Existing evidence suggests that being surrounded by others who are politically active is a predictor of individual political engagement (Klandermans et al., 2008]]). For instance, participation in a group discussion focused on political issues boosted intentions to take collective action (Thomas et al., 2016]]). Knowing someone who participates in action and being asked to protest by someone were the strongest predictors of protest engagement (Schussman & Soule, 2005]]). Importantly, the mobilizing effect of other people does not require direct contact. A study on political mobilization showed that political messages delivered to social media users influenced not only those who received them but also their friends and friends of friends, with the effect of social transmission being greater than the direct effect of the messages (Bond et al., 2012]]). Similarly, research on perceived social norms demonstrated that they are positively related to political behavior (e.g., Gerber & Rogers, 2009]]; Potoczek et al., 2022]]; Tankard & Paluck, 2016]]).

A similar pattern of results can be found in the context of violent political action. Simply having a friend who is engaged in a violent course of action is positively related to individual violent involvement in that cause. For instance, a longitudinal study demonstrated that adolescents whose peers had been involved in illegal political behavior were more likely to get involved in such behavior themselves (Dahl & Van Zalk, 2014]]). Past research also demonstrated a positive relationship between having violent friends and becoming an ISIS foreign fighter (Holman, 2016]]), joining al-Qaeda (Sageman, 2004]]), using violence among political extremists in the United States (Jasko et al., 2017]]), and supporting violent extremism (Jasko et al., 2020]]; Webber et al., 2018]]). Taken together, this body of research consistently shows that interaction with and the perception of political activism in others are positively related to one’s own level of political engagement. However, it is currently less clear what psychological mechanisms account for the effects of social norms. Drawing on goal systems theory (Kruglanski, Chernikova, et al., 2015), several possible mechanisms could be proposed to account for the effects of social context.

First, social context can influence the perceived value of the cause. When people interact with others who are politically engaged, political goals become more salient to the point that they dominate over other concerns. Research on opinion polarization demonstrates that when people discuss issues with others they radicalize and become more committed to those opinions. They are more likely to moralize those issues and form a politicized identity around them. In turn, people who are strongly identified with a particular group or an issue react with greater outrage and anger when they perceive this group/cause to be unfairly treated, even if they do not experience injustice firsthand (Van Zomeren et al., 2008]]). Research on group fusion further confirms that people who are strongly identified with a group or a cause are more likely to support fighting and dying on its behalf (e.g., Gómez et al., 2011]]; Swann et al., 2009]]). For instance, a study on revolutionary Libyan groups showed that nearly half of the active fighters felt a higher sense of fusion with their battalion than with their own families, whereas just over a quarter of the non-fighters felt this way (Whitehouse et al. 2014]]). On a less extreme level, when people see that the majority of people in society believe that climate change is an important threat, they might be motivated to revisit their own perceptions of how important this problem should be for them as well. In line with that possibility, recent work showed that when people believe that voting is more normative in society, they are more likely to consider their participation in elections as important; that applies particularly to people who felt they had no socio-political control themselves (Potoczek et al., 2022]]).

A second possible mechanism through which social networks might exert their effects involves expectations of success. Those who are already involved in collective action have a higher sense of self-efficacy (Niemi et al., 1991]]), they are less pessimistic about political reality, and they believe that their efforts can actually solve the problem (Fox & Schofield, 1989]]). Therefore, when people interact with others who are politically engaged, their perception of the attainability of the cause might also change. Higher collective efficacy can in turn motivate them to engage in political behavior because they feel they can influence problems that might otherwise seem uncontrollable and overwhelming. They might also exaggerate the popularity of the cause, which can further strengthen their commitment. For instance, when other people consider climate change to be an important issue, a person might expect that actions aimed at fighting climate change will be more successful than when the majority of the population seems to ignore it.

Finally, as mentioned earlier, despite the role played by value and expectancy in forming goal intentions, it is important to remember that intentions are not always translated into actions (Sheeran, 2002]]; Webb & Sheeran, 2006]]). People might not know how to pursue a given goal, or they might lack the resources, skills, or opportunities needed to perform a behavior that serves this goal. Therefore, even a belief that a cause is important accompanied by an expectation that it might in fact succeed might not be enough to motivate people to do something about it. Therefore, an alternative explanation for why people are more likely to engage in actions under the influence of politically active others is that they gain awareness and access to appropriate means. For instance, people who interact with violence-supporting others may come to a conclusion that violence is an appropriate action to fight for the cause. In support of that, a recent study demonstrated that individuals who perceived political issues in moral terms were more supportive of violence at protests when they were convinced that other people supported the use of violence than when they saw no social convergence (Mooijman et al., 2018]]). In contrast, those who interact with peaceful activists might start perceiving marches, demonstrations, or petitions as instrumental ways to strive for political goals. Moreover, while some political actions might be psychologically demanding, creating a local norm might decrease the difficulty of individual engagement. For instance, research has demonstrated that when people perceived others to be supportive of violent actions, they were more likely to engage in violence themselves, in part because they experienced less stress about it (Webber et al., 2013]]). In short, social context can make effortful behaviors easier to perform by offering support (Fitzsimons et al., 2015]]), incentives (Willer, 2009]]), and opportunities to act (Littman & Paluck, 2015]]).

In short, whereas factors related to social context such as group identity, having direct contact to politically active others, and positive social norms have been investigated in past research, their exact psychological mechanisms are unclear. Drawing on the motivational accounts could enrich our understanding of social influence in the political domain and offer insights into the processes through which such influence occurs.

### Conclusion

Whereas the usefulness of goal systems theory has been demonstrated in multiple domains such as health behaviors (Zhang et al., 2007]]), romantic relationships (Orehek & Forest, 2016]]), and consumer behaviors (Kopetz et al., 2012]]), its potential for understanding political behaviors has been underused. In this chapter I outlined the main directions inspired by this theoretical framework in which research on political engagement could be further developed.

One fruitful avenue for future research would be to investigate the role of relative goal importance for political engagement as it could explain the puzzle of low levels of political engagement even when people declare the cause to be high on absolute importance. For example, inconsistent findings with regard to biographical availability and activism could be examined with a greater focus on conflicting versus facilitating relationships between political goals and other active life goals. Similarly, the role of multifinal versus counterfinal associations between political actions and the goals that they fulfill or harm could further inform the specific role political engagement plays in one’s life.

Also, while the role of collective efficacy has been extensively studied in the context on political engagement, the specific aspect of goal expectancy related to perceived instrumentality of political means offers another opportunity for research. Moving beyond the distinction between violent and peaceful actions, future research could examine perceptions of the effectiveness of actions that differ in terms of the sacrifice (e.g., effort) they require. On the one hand, sacrificial actions could signal the immense importance of the cause, and through this mechanism they could motivate greater engagement. On the other hand, seeing an activist who commits their entire life to the cause might decrease the expectancy of success if one doubts that enough other people will follow in their footsteps. Similarly, research on risky activist behaviors could be informed by the goal–means analysis that has been so far applied to other types of risky behaviors (Kopetz & Starnes, see Chapter 2]] in this volume).

Finally, I proposed how the mechanisms behind the impact of social context and social norms on political engagement might be conceptualized within the goal systems framework. This line of reasoning could be further developed into an analysis of political actions as a case of interdependent pursuit of collective goals (Fitzsimons et al., 2015]]). In short, while these are just a few examples of research areas that could benefit from incorporating insights from goal systems theory, I am convinced that this theoretical framework will inspire many more of them in the next 20 years.

The Interplay between Goal Systems and Identities](04_Contents1.xhtml#n0014)

Maferima Touré-Tillery and Jessica Gamlin

Identities are collections of thoughts, ideas, and pieces of knowledge people have about themselves (e.g., professional chef, mother, good person); and together, identities constitute the self-concept. Socio-cognitive theorists conceptualize the self-concept as an elaborate, dynamic, memory-based structure that is hierarchically organized and comprised of interconnected “identity” nodes (e.g., Greenwald & Banaji, 1989]]; Klein & Kihlstrom, 1986]]; Markus, 1977]]). Each identity is cognitively associated with subordinate traits, personal memories, thoughts, and emotions that describe a person’s perception of themselves within that aspect of their life (Garczynski & Brown, 2013]]; Showers, 1992]]; Zeigler-Hill & Showers, 2007]]). Contextual cues (e.g., advertisements) can activate specific identities and their corresponding characteristics, which guide subsequent thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (Bolton & Reed, 2004]]; Linville & Carlston, 1994]]; Markus & Wurf, 1987]]; Reed et al., 2012]]). Identities may be personal (e.g., professional chef), relational (e.g., mother; Andersen & Chen, 2002]]), or collective (e.g., club member; Brewer & Gardner, 1996]]) and vary in importance (Winterich et al., 2009]]) and centrality to the self-concept (Aquino et al., 2009]]; Holmes et al., 2019]]; Settles, 2004]]).

Goals are mental representations of desired end states (e.g., obtain a degree; Austin & Vancouver, 1996]]; Fishbach & Ferguson, 2007]]; E. T. Higgins & Kruglanski, 2000]]). According to goal systems theory, people’s goals and the objects or activities that facilitate them (i.e., means) are stored in memory in an interconnected, hierarchical structure (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]; see Chapter 1]] in this volume). In this mental network, goals are cognitively associated with corresponding means and related goals, and means are associated with related means and goals. Subordinate elements (means or subgoals) support superordinate goals. Facilitative links exist between vertically connected elements, such that the activation of one leads to the activation of the other. By contrast, inhibitory links typically exist between lateral elements, such that active goals may block out competing goals (Shah et al., 2002]]) or competing means (Kruglanski et al., 2002]]). Multiple means can serve a single goal (_equifinality_), and one means can serve multiple goals (_multifinality_; see Chapter 7]] in this volume). As with identities, goals vary in their importance (Austin & Vancouver, 1996]]; Locke et al., 1981]]) and may be personal (e.g., start a restaurant; Baum & Locke, 2004]]), relational (e.g., adopt a child; Langher et al., 2019]]), or collective (e.g., fundraise for a club; Hogg et al., 2008]]).

The cognitive structures that support goals and identities are intricately linked. This chapter examines the bidirectional relationship between goal systems and identities and the unique roles identities play within goal systems. First, the processes and outcomes of goal pursuit can shape identities (Bem, 1972]]; Kruglanski & Kopetz, 2009]]), and many identities evolve during the pursuit of important goals (Singer, 2004]]). For example, an identity as a restaurateur may emerge through the pursuit of the goal to open a restaurant. Second, identities affect both choices of goals (Allport, 1943]]; Cantor et al., 1986]]; Markus & Nurius, 1986]]; Saint Clair & Forehand, 2020]]) and choices of means (Berger & Heath, 2008]]; Escalas & Bettman, 2005]]; Gao et al., 2009]]). A chef’s decision to open their own restaurant (a goal) is informed in part by the norms, expectations, and aspirations associated with their identity as a professional chef. Moreover, the means the chef chooses along the way (e.g., which ovens they select, whose capital they solicit) are likely to be influenced by their chef identity. Third, identities themselves can be both goals and means. A culinary student may pursue the goal to “be a chef” (an identity goal) as vigorously as the goal to “acquire culinary knowledge, skills, and certifications” (a learning goal). Once certified, they may join a professional chef club, thereby using their chef identity as a means to pursue their career and social goals.

### Goal Systems Shape Identities

People’s identities are shaped by the goals they adopt and pursue, by the ways in which they pursue these goals, and by the outcomes of their pursuits (see Figure 13.1]]).

Figure 13.1 Goals and Means Shape Identities

_Note_: Elements of the goal system are depicted in gray.

#### Goals Shape Identities

While some identities are endowed at birth (e.g., nationality, ethnicity), other identities evolve or are adopted while fulfilling fundamental needs (e.g., affiliation, belonging) or pursuing important goals (e.g., physical fitness, academic achievement; McConnell, 2011]]; Reed et al., 2012]]). For example, a person might join a local running club to train for a marathon (serving their fitness goal) and to meet new people (serving their affiliation needs). While pursuing these goals, they may adopt a “club member” identity (resulting from their need for affiliation) and a “runner” identity (resulting from their fitness goal; see also McConnell et al., 2012]]). Thus, goals can shape identities by adding to the collection of thoughts, ideas, and knowledge people have about themselves.

According to self-perception theory (Bem, 1972)]], people learn about themselves by observing their own behaviors and drawing inferences about themselves (e.g., their own skills, characteristics, competencies, and values), just as they draw inferences about others from their behaviors. Narrative identity researchers conceptualize identity as the evolving story people tell themselves about their own lives, in which they are the protagonists (McAdams, 1987]]; Singer, 2004]]). Observations about one’s own goals (and associated successes and failures) add to the narrative of who one is (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000]]). A chef who is pursuing the goal of opening their own restaurant inevitably will encounter breakthroughs (e.g., securing a loan) and setbacks (e.g., delayed delivery of ovens) that contribute to the story they tell themselves about their life and who they are as a person. Once our chef opens the doors to their restaurant, “Chez Moi,” their identity as a restaurateur will be cemented. If their venture fails, however, this identity may be disrupted as they dust themselves off and try again, or it may dissolve altogether if they decide to abandon the goal (see Chapter 9]] in this volume).

#### Means Shape Identities

Just as people make self-inferences from their goals, people also learn about themselves by observing the means they select during goal pursuit (Fishbach & Dhar, 2005]]). The self-inferences drawn from goal-related choices and actions are affected by several factors including the initial level of commitment to the goal (Koo & Fishbach, 2008]]), the structure of a choice set (Fishbach & Zhang, 2008]]), and the ease of making external attributions (Zhang & Huang, 2010]]). Fishbach et al. (2006)]] find that people are more likely to make self-inferences about their commitment to a goal when they interpret goal-related choices or actions at an abstract (vs. concrete) level; then, the self-inferences increase their motivation to pursue similar goal-related actions. For example, actions such as cooking and eating vegetables are more likely to increase a person’s motivation to take other steps consistent with their physical fitness goal (e.g., go to the gym) if they interpret the actions abstractly as “health consciousness” than if they focus on the concrete steps involved in cooking and eating vegetables.

Identities also can be informed and defined by the objects, products, and brands people purchase and use in goal pursuit (Ahuvia, 2005]]; Brasel & Gips, 2011]]; Elliot & Wattanasuwan, 1998; Fitzsimons et al., 2008]]; James, 1890]]; Markman & Brendl, 2000]]). For example, donning an apron to cook (a functional means to the cooking goal) may make a culinary student feel like a true chef (an identity). Over time, people may form intimate connections with the objects, products, and brands they use in goal pursuit (Escalas & Bettman, 2003]]; Fournier, 1998]]) and adopt identities based on their use of specific brands and products (e.g., “Instagrammer,” “sneaker head,” “Target mom”). Marketers actively encourage consumers to form identities around brands. A good example of this strategy is Apple’s popular “Get a Mac” television advertising campaign (2006–2009), in which a cool young man dressed in casual clothes introduces himself as an Apple computer (“Hello, I’m a Mac”), while an uptight man in a more formal attire introduces himself as a Microsoft personal computer (“And I’m a PC”). Today, many Mac and PC users—including the authors of this chapter—have come to embrace the identities conferred by means, such as computers and other devices, with which they pursue their academic, career, and social goals (see Chapter 6]] in this volume).

### Identities Shape Goal Systems

Identities shape people’s goals and the means they select for goal pursuit (see Figure 13.2]]).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-035-colour.gif)

Figure 13.2 Identities Shape Goals and Means

_Note_: Elements of the goal system are depicted in gray.

#### Identities Shape Goals

Identities come with norms that guide a person’s behavior and provide a sense of purpose in life (Thoits, [^1983], [^2003]). For example, a masculine identity generally is associated with agentic (self-focused) goals, whereas a feminine identity is associated with communal (other-focused) goals (Bakan, 1966]]; Eagly, 1987]]; He et al., 2008]]). Internalizing a particular gender identity increases one’s likelihood of pursuing gender-stereotypic career goals (Evans & Diekman, 2009]]) and influences the adoption of prosocial goals. For example, Winterich et al. (2009)]] study the impacts of gender identity and moral identity on donation behavior among Western consumers (United States). They find that internalizing a strong moral identity tends to increase donations to out-group recipients (e.g., Indonesia) but not to in-group recipients (e.g., New Orleans in the United States) among consumers with a feminine gender identity; the reverse occurs among those with a masculine gender identity. Similarly, Winterich et al. (2012)]] find that moral identity drives donations to charities that align with a person’s political identity. Specifically, internalizing a strong moral identity increases liberals’ willingness to donate to a charity focused on traditionally liberal values (e.g., fairness, preventing harm) and increases conservatives’ willingness to donate to a charity focused on traditionally conservative values (e.g., private enterprise; for more on political goals, see Chapter 12]] in this volume).

Research on expectancy-value theory shows that people are more motivated to adopt a goal if the outcome seems attractive (value) and attainable (expectancy; Brehm & Self, 1989]]; Liberman & Förster, 2008]]; Mitchell, 1982]]). Personal factors related to identity (e.g., personality type, background, occupation) can influence assessments of value and expectancy (Eccles, 2009]]; Hollenbeck & Klein, 1987]]), which affect the motivation to adopt a goal and commitment to the goal (Reed et al., 2012]]). Goals that are relevant to a person’s identities usually seem the most valuable (Berkman et al., 2017]]) and attainable (Oyserman et al., 2017]]). For example, people who identify as independent report a higher likelihood of speaking their mind, an act that is congruent with the independent identity (Markus, 1977]]); people with (vs. without) an exerciser identity are more committed to and interested in the goal of exercising regularly and have more “tricks and strategies” (i.e., means) for getting themselves to exercise on days when their motivation is low (Kendzierski, 1988]]).

Furthermore, people tend to be more committed to goals that are relevant to identities that are central or important to their self-concepts (Holmes et al., 2019]]; Reitzes & Mutran, 2002]]). For example, the centrality of their “student” identity is positively related to college students’ commitment to educational goals and to their institution, as well as to their intentions to persist at school (Bowman & Felix, 2017]]). Settles (2004)]] also finds that when people are pursing goals such as getting good grades in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes, the centrality of one goal-relevant identity (e.g., scientist) can counteract some of the negative effects of conflicting identities (e.g., female) that might otherwise impede goal attainment due to negative stereotypes about such identities in the goal domain.

Within this perspective, identities can not only encourage but also discourage the adoption of a goal, depending on the congruence of that goal with a particular identity. For example, Diekman et al. (2010)]] show that women avoid careers in STEM partly because women tend to endorse communal goals (e.g., working with or helping others) more than men, and STEM careers are perceived as relatively unlikely to fulfill communal goals. Finally, if an identity becomes incompatible with a person’s current goals, they may need to actively distance themselves from that identity. For example, Lavallee and Robinson (2007)]] found that gymnasts who were retiring from athletic careers had to relinquish their strong gymnast identities before they could embrace new life goals and identities.

#### Identities Shape Means

A rich literature spanning social psychology, sociology, and consumer research shows that identities can determine the means people choose to pursue their goals (Bolton & Reed, 2004]]; Epp & Price, 2008]]; Gao et al., 2020]]; Reed, 2004]]; Shang et al., 2008; Summers et al, 2016]]). Gender identity has well-documented effects on the choice of means. For example, men tend to avoid stereotypically feminine objects, activities, and products (e.g., body care, jewelry; Brough et al., 2016]]; Dittmar et al., 1996]]). Brough et al. (2016)]] showed that men were more likely to choose non-green (vs. green) products when their masculine identity was salient/activated because of the strong implicit association between greenness and femininity. Similarly, Meyers-Levy (1988)]] activated either a masculine or feminine identity and asked participants to evaluate a new mouthwash; activating the masculine identity led male participants to make agentic judgments focused on self-relevant information (e.g., “kills germs and bacteria that cause decay”), whereas activating the feminine identity led female participants to make communal judgments focused on self- and other-relevant information (e.g., “provides pleasing fresh breath”). We might expect a male (vs. female) chef’s gender and the salience of this gender identity to undermine the use of eco-friendly culinary tools (perceived as feminine) and the choice of ingredients marketed with other-focused claims (perceived as more feminine than self-focused claims).

Other identities besides gender can affect the perceived value of objects, brands, and products (Reed et al., 2012]]) and thus influence the selection of means during goal pursuit. For example, a person’s chef identity may influence the cooking tools they select for not only their restaurant but also their home. Forehand et al. (2002)]] find that a salient identity boosts the evaluation of identity-relevant target stimuli (such as means to a goal) but hurts the evaluation of stimuli associated with an identity one does not hold. In one study, Forehand et al. increased ethnic identity salience among Asian and Caucasian students. When their ethnic identities were salient, Asian participants had more positive reactions than Caucasian participants to a computer advertisement featuring an Asian spokesperson. This finding suggests that, under certain circumstances, people’s choices of laptops (a means to academic and career goals) may be influenced by their racial or ethnic identities.

### Identities Within Goal Systems

Beyond shaping and being shaped by goals and means, identities play important roles within goal systems, where they can operate as goals (Figure 13.3]]) or as means (Figure 13.4]]).

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-036-colour.gif)

Figure 13.3 Identities Operate as Goals Within Goal Systems

![image](../img/oso-9780197687468-graphic-037-colour.gif)

Figure 13.4 Identities Operate as Means Within Goal Systems

#### Identities as Goals

Identities can operate as goals in the sense that people take steps to achieve desired perceptions of themselves or to avoid undesired perceptions (Berger & Heath, 2007]]; Berger & Ward, 2010]]). Like other goals within a goal system, an identity goal (e.g., become a chef) is linked to subgoals (get a culinary arts degree) and means (study for a test, join a professional chef association). In addition to specific identity goals, most people have an overarching motivation—that is, a higher-order goal—to maintain an overall positive self-concept as a good, moral, and competent individual (Dunning, 2007]]; Greenwald, 1980]]; Greenwald & Breckler, 1985]]; Steele, 1988]]). Our aspiring chef may wish to “be a good person” as a higher-order goal; they may have an associated subgoal such as “helping the homeless,” which they may achieve by means of “volunteering at a soup kitchen.”

People perform many behaviors in the service of acquiring, claiming, or maintaining desired identities (Wicklund & Gollwitzer, 1982]]). Specifically, people self-signal: They strategically engage in behaviors they consider consistent with a desired identity to signal to themselves that they have the identity (Prelec & Bodner, 2003]]). In some cases, identity goals supersede related non-identity goals. For example, a music student might value acquiring the identity of a guitarist more than acquiring the ability to play the guitar (a non-identity, learning goal). The dominance of the identity goal might lead the music student to purchase the flashiest guitar case available, which signals their guitarist identity to the world and themselves but does not help them actually learn to play the instrument. In other cases, identity goals are secondary to (or as important as) related non-identity goals. For example, a culinary student might value the ability to prepare delicious foods (a non-identity, learning goal) more than the identity goal of being a professional chef; they might value the goal of helping the homeless (a non-identity, prosocial goal) as much as the goal of being kind and generous (an identity goal).

#### Self-Discrepancy

As with non-identity goals, successful attainment or progress toward an identity goal elicits positive emotional responses, whereas failure to attain or make progress toward the goal elicits negative emotional responses and coping methods such as shifting means (Kruglanski & Jaffe, 1988]]; see Chapter 9]] in this volume) and abandoning the goal (Lewin, 1935]]; Miller, 1944]]). In the case of identity goals, “failure” can take the form of negative feedback that is related to the identity (e.g., low performance on a test; Eskreis-Winkler & Fishbach, 2019]]), upward social comparison (e.g., _resources/books//Goal Systems Theory_ Psychological Process - Arie W. Kruglanski of idealized attractive models in an advertisement; Richins, 1991]]; Sobol & Darke, 2014]]), or social exclusion (Lee & Shrum, 2012]]). These types of failures elicit a _self-discrepancy_: a perceived inconsistency between who a person is (their current identity) and who they ideally want to be, ought to be, or possibly could be (E. T. Higgins, 1987]]). Such self-discrepancy threatens the person’s self-concept and motivates them to engage in compensatory behaviors that might reduce or resolve the discrepancy (Gollwitzer et al., 2013]]; Heine et al., 2006]]; Tesser et al., 2000]]).

To illustrate, imagine that our aspiring chef prepares a lackluster soufflé, which prompts a self-discrepancy between the resultant self-perception as an incompetent cook and their desired identity as a chef. According to the compensatory consumer behavior model (Mandel et al., 2017)]], the aspiring chef might seek to resolve the self-discrepancy through (a) direct resolution (e.g., getting more practice), (b) symbolic self-completion (e.g., buying the tallest white chef’s hat), (c) dissociation (e.g., giving away their apron), (d) escapism (e.g., going to a bar to drown their sorrows), or (e) fluid compensation (e.g., taking up rock climbing to assert their athleticism). These five strategies can be categorized broadly as either shifting means (direct resolution, symbolic self-completion, and fluid compensation) or abandoning the goal (dissociation and escapism).

In one demonstration of symbolic self-completion, Gao et al. (2009)]] asked participants to write about their intelligence using either their dominant or non-dominant hand; those who had to use their non-dominant hand experienced a self-discrepancy with the identity of being an intelligent person. Then, to resolve the self-discrepancy, the non-dominant-hand participants were more likely than the dominant-hand participants to select a fountain pen—closely associated with intelligence—over a pack of M&Ms as a reward for participation.

#### Self-Diagnosticity

In general, people tend to select means or actions that seem most instrumental to (i.e., useful for) goal attainment (Markman & Brendl, 2000]]; Shah & Kruglanski, 2003; Zhang et al., 2007]]). For identity goals, people tend to select means or goal-consistent actions that seem particularly _self-diagnostic_, or indicative of the type of person they are (Prelec & Bodner, 2003]]; Touré-Tillery & Fishbach, [^2012], [^2015]). A prospective volunteer is more likely to help at the soup kitchen if they believe that the acts of preparing and serving meals to the homeless are particularly self-diagnostic (e.g., of their kindness and generosity) than if they perceive these acts as non-diagnostic. In the next two subsections, we explain how an action is more likely to be perceived as self-diagnostic if it (a) unambiguously signals the identity or (b) is expected to be memorable.

##### Unambiguous Signals

Behaviors and choices that can be attributed unambiguously to one’s internal traits and characteristics seem more self-diagnostic (Baumeister et al., 2001]]; Schweitzer & Hsee, 2002]]), while behaviors with multiple possible attributions seem less self-diagnostic (Dana et al., 2007]]; Gur & Sackeim, 1979]]; Hsee et al., 2003]]). For example, while browsing a bookstore for a good read, we would expect our aspiring chef to choose a book on molecular gastronomy over a book of culinary jokes. Molecular gastronomy is inaccessible to most readers, so it unambiguously signals their professional identity, whereas culinary jokes may be enjoyed by Food Network enthusiasts as well as professional chefs. Similarly, our aspiring chef may decide to whip up a soufflé from memory rather than from a cookbook to unambiguously signal their professional identity, as “regular people” presumably would need to use a cookbook to make such a complicated recipe.

People who hold a higher-order goal of being a good person tend to favor unambiguously good behaviors over behaviors that could be categorized as good or neutral. They also tend to favor bad behaviors that could be categorized as bad or neutral over those that are unambiguously bad because the former could serve other goals without hurting the identity goal. For example, a “good person” who is browsing the office supply closet is more likely to take home a $5 pack of pens than $5 in cash because taking pens from the office is easier to rationalize (e.g., “I work here,” “I am going to use them for work-related things”). Mazar et al. (2008)]] provided participants with an opportunity to cheat for financial gain, and participants tended to take the opportunity—but they pursued less than the maximum amount of money possible. Furthermore, after performing the dishonest behavior, participants still perceived themselves as good, honest people. The authors concluded that people behave dishonestly enough to benefit their wallets but not so dishonestly that it would hurt their perceptions of themselves as good people.

Recent research posits another dimension of ambiguity: the extent to which decisions seem real. The rationale is that a person will perceive themselves as more generous if they actually donate (vs. imagine donating) $50 because a hypothetical or imagined donation is an ambiguous signal of generosity. Touré-Tillery and Wang (2022) show that decisions made on paper seem more real and hence more self-diagnostic than those made on digital devices, which are inextricably linked to the virtual world—conceptualized as not actual, not real, and not of the physical, natural, or material world. Accordingly, Touré-Tillery and Wang find that people make more virtuous decisions on paper than on digital devices in the contexts of prosocial decisions, book choices, and food choices. In one field experiment involving a student-led charity event, potential donors read a charitable appeal on paper or on a digital device (tablet) and decided whether to help. People who decided on paper (vs. a tablet) were more likely both to pledge and to fulfill the pledge with monetary or in-kind donations.

The self-diagnosticity of a behavior that is consistent with an identity goal may be threatened if the person obtains large benefits (or incurs very low costs) from the behavior, in terms of time, effort (Dhar & Wertenbroch, 2012]]), financial or material resources (Dubé et al., 2017]]; Gneezy, Gneezy, et al., 2012]]; Mazar et al., 2008]]; Savary et al., 2020]]), or social capital (Kristofferson et al., 2014]]). Then, the behavior could be attributed to the external benefits (or lack of costs) instead of internal traits and characteristics (i.e., identity). Highly self-diagnostic behaviors are those that do not seem to benefit the person directly or seem to be costly, in which case there is no ambiguity about the person’s motives.

For example, Gneezy, Imas, et al. (2012) show that a costly prosocial act (e.g., donating one’s own money to charity) is a stronger signal of prosocial identity than a costless prosocial act (e.g., having someone else donate money to charity in one’s name). Indeed, a costless prosocial behavior provides an ambiguous signal of identity as it could be attributed to the effortlessness if the act or to the generosity of the proxy. Accordingly, people are more likely to continue to behave in line with their prosocial identity for subsequent decisions after performing a costly (vs. costless) prosocial act because the prosocial identity is solidified by costly behavior.

The same principle applies to benefits/costs that are social rather than financial. Savary and Goldsmith (2020)]] show that the presence of a social-signaling or impression-management motive can reduce the perceived self-diagnosticity of virtuous behaviors. For example, donating to charity seems more self-diagnostic of generosity if the donation is private than if the donation is public, in which case the donor’s motivation could be attributed to either the donor’s generosity or the donor’s desire to show off or receive social praise (a social-signaling motive). By contrast, a private donation cannot be attributed to social-signaling motives, leaving the donor’s generosity as the only viable explanation and enabling the donor to fulfill their identity goal. Accordingly, public recognition decreases people’s willingness to donate (Savary & Goldsmith, 2020]]). Making publicity a mandatory (vs. voluntary) feature of the donation may help mitigate this effect because it removes the ambiguity associated with a public donation (A. X. Yang & Hsee, 2022]]).

People not only behave in accordance with the degree of clarity or ambiguity of the signal their actions carry but also attempt to manipulate the clarity or ambiguity of this signal. When pursuing identity goals in conjunction with related non-identity goals (e.g., achievement), people often introduce ambiguity by choosing detrimental means for the achievement goal (“self-handicapping”) or remove ambiguity by avoiding instrumental means for the achievement goal (“self-sabotaging”). Self-handicapping occurs when people expect to fail at a focal achievement goal that is strongly connected to an important identity goal, such that failing at the achievement goal would damage their self-worth and constitute a setback for their identity goal (Berglas & Jones, 1978]]; R. L. Higgins & Harris, 1988]]). In such cases, people may intentionally introduce ambiguity into the attribution of their impending failure by selecting means that will impede their progress. Then, they can attribute their failure to external obstacles or circumstances instead of themselves (Martin et al., 2003]]). Self-sabotaging occurs in the opposite situation: When people expect to succeed at a focal achievement goal that is strongly connected to an important identity goal, they steer clear of instrumental means to avoid adding ambiguity to the attribution of their success. Then, they can attribute their success to themselves instead of external circumstances (Gamlin, 2019]]).

For example, studying for a test is an important means to the focal goal of getting good grades (a non-identity, achievement goal), which may be related to the goal of being a competent person (identity goal). Gamlin’s (2019)]] studies showed that students who anticipated getting an A on an important final exam self-sabotaged by avoiding instrumental means (e.g., declining to study with a more knowledgeable student before the exam). The decision was driven by ego-enhancement needs—that is, a desire to advance the identity goal of being a competent individual. By contrast, students who anticipated doing poorly on the exam tended to self-handicap by choosing to party the night before, and the decision was driven by ego-protection needs—that is, a desire to avoid setbacks in the pursuit of the goal of being a competent individual. Research shows that self-handicapping by procrastinating, slacking, abusing substances, or finding distractions instead of studying for tests is more likely among students who strongly associate getting good grades with being a competent person (R. L. Higgins et al., 1990]]).

##### Expected Memorability

It is well documented that what people remember about themselves (i.e., autobiographical memory) has a strong influence on their self-concept (Belk, 1988]]; Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000]]; McAdams, 1987]]; Wilson & Ross, 2003]]). Recent studies suggest that, beyond what people actually remember, what they expect to remember or forget (i.e., expected memorability) affects the self-diagnosticity of identity-goal-consistent actions. People perceive an action as more self-diagnostic if they expect to remember (vs. forget) the action because remembered actions will have a greater influence on the ability to maintain a desired self-concept in the future. For example, while making a sweet-potato pie, our aspiring chef may be more likely to make the crust from scratch (rather than expediting the task with store-bought crust) if they expect to remember the choice than if they expect to forget it.

Touré-Tillery and Kouchaki (2021)]] show that when people have low memory efficacy—that is, when they believe they have a poor memory—they are less likely to contribute to a charitable cause or to make healthy food choices than a control group. In one study, the researchers manipulated memory efficacy by asking participants to write a short essay about what they did the previous morning (control condition) or a morning 1 month ago (low–memory efficacy condition). This task relied on meta-cognitive difficulty to change participants’ perceptions of their memory efficacy; recalling a relatively mundane activity from 1 month ago is difficult and should cause participants to doubt their memory capabilities. Participants then decided whether to donate part of their study compensation to charity or keep it for themselves. The results showed that participants in the low–memory efficacy condition were less likely to donate than those in the control condition—that is, they were less likely to select the identity-goal-consistent action—because the lower likelihood of memory formation made the action seem less self-diagnostic.

Drawing from research on primacy and recency memory effects (see Greene, 1986]], for a review), Touré-Tillery and Fishbach (2012)]] posit that people not only are actually more likely to remember experiences that happened first or last (vs. in the middle) but also expect to form stronger memories of first and last experiences. When people complete a sequence of actions toward a goal, the actions at the beginning and end (vs. in the middle) have greater expected memorability, so they seem more self-diagnostic. In one study, participants were tasked with proofreading 10 passages, and they were instructed to assign themselves to the short or long version of each passage by privately flipping a coin (labeled _short_ on one side and _long_ on the other). When a participant got a long coin flip, they could either be honest and work on the long task or lie about the coin flip and work on the short task to finish the study more quickly. The authors estimated the rate of lying by comparing the percentage of participants who reported a short coin flip with chance (50%). The results showed that significantly more participants lied in the middle of the task than at the beginning and end, when the dishonest action might be more memorable and, thus, more threatening to one’s identity as a good person.

Touré-Tillery and Fishbach (2015)]] replicated the findings in a single-decision context to rule out alternative explanations (e.g., perhaps people behave less virtuously in the middle of multiple sequential actions due to tiredness or boredom). In a field experiment at a business school, Touré-Tillery and Fishbach (2015)]] set up a free snack table (a common offering at the school) with an indulgent option (Kit Kat bars) and a healthier option (Sunkist raisin packets). A pretest confirmed that most students at the school valued health consciousness, so raisins were the more virtuous, identity-goal-consistent choice. Behind the snack table, a poster described the snack choice as occurring at the beginning of the afternoon, in the middle of the day, or at the end of the morning—all accurate descriptions since the experiment ran around noon. The results showed that students were more likely to choose raisins, behaving in line with the identity goal of being health-conscious, when the poster described the choice as occurring at the beginning or end (vs. middle) of the time frame.

The expected memorability of a specific action also is affected by the extent to which a person’s identities overlap. People vary in the number of identities they hold and the degree of overlap among these identities (Brewer & Gardner, 1996]]); _identity-overlap_ is the extent to which a person’s thoughts and feelings about themselves are consistent across their identities (see Linville, 1985]]; Rafaeli-Mor et al., 1999]]). People with low identity-overlap view their identities as compartmentalized, such that their thoughts and feelings about themselves differ across identities (“I am a gentle and relaxed parent, but I am a competitive and resilient business owner”). People with high identity-overlap view their identities as interconnected, such that their thoughts and feelings about themselves are similar across identities (“I am a gentle and relaxed parent and business owner”). Touré-Tillery and Light (2018)]] posit that when a person with high identity-overlap performs a “good deed” in one identity (e.g., keeping a difficult promise to a business partner), the associated positive thoughts (“I am a reliable business owner”) will generalize to the person’s other identities (“I am a reliable parent”). The same occurs with negative thoughts after a “bad deed.” Thus, people with high (vs. low) identity-overlap see their actions as more self-diagnostic because they expect their actions and the accompanying thoughts and feelings to be more salient in all aspects of their lives. In turn, people with high (vs. low) identity-overlap are more likely to behave in line with their identity goals.

In one study, Touré-Tillery and Light (2018)]] manipulated participants’ perceptions of identity-overlap (high vs. low) and then had them complete a study, ostensibly about intuition, in which participants predicted the outcome of a private coin flip. Half of the participants read that they would receive additional compensation if their prediction was correct, introducing an incentive to (dishonestly) report correct predictions. The no-incentive condition established the baseline prediction accuracy: There was no difference in the rate of reported correct predictions between the low- and high-overlap conditions. In the presence of an incentive, however, more participants in the low- (vs. high-) overlap condition reported correct predictions, indicating more dishonesty. In sum, participants with high identity-overlap were less likely to lie, so they were more likely to behave consistently with the identity goal of being a good person.

Finally, Gai and Puntoni (2021)]] examine whether the self-diagnosticity of a dishonest action—lying—is affected by whether the person uses their first language (L1) or a foreign language (L2). Most experiences and knowledge are encoded in L1, so the authors argue that L1 is a stronger cue for autobiographical memories than L2. Thus, actions conducted in L1 should have higher expected memorability and hence should seem more self-diagnostic. In one study, the authors recruited Dutch participants who were fluent in English to complete a series of surveys in Dutch (L1) or English (L2). After completing one survey, participants were instructed to use a private coin flip to assign themselves to a short version (2 minutes) or a long version (10 minutes) of the next study. A significantly higher percentage of participants reported a short coin flip in the L2 condition than in the L1 condition, indicating that participants were more likely to lie to save time in L2 than in L1. Thus, participants behaved more consistently with the identity goal of being an honest person when using L1, the language with stronger cues for autobiographical memory.

#### Identities as Means

Identities serve as resources in the pursuit of various goals. For one, an identity may facilitate one’s need for affiliation or the pursuit of a career goal (L. Q. Yang et al., 2013]]). Upon moving to a new city, a professional chef who identifies as female may join the local women’s business association to make new friends and build her professional network. For another, an identity might be useful for establishing credibility or authority in social interactions (Housley & Fitzgerald, 2002]]; Llewellyn, 2004]]). During a casual conversation about soufflés, our professional chef might establish her expertise by starting her argument with, “As a pastry chef, I think. . .” In the next two subsections, we explain how the extent to which an identity functions as an instrumental means (or as an impediment) depends on the person’s self-efficacy and the existence of stereotypes or discrimination associated with the person’s identity in the goal context.

##### Self-Efficacy

Like other means, identities—or, generally, the self—can be perceived as more or less instrumental for achieving a goal. _Self-efficacy_ is a person’s belief in their own capacity to execute behaviors necessary to attain a desired outcome (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997). A person high in self-efficacy in a given context sees themselves as an instrumental means to ends in that context, which increases their commitment and motivation to pursue the ends. Self-efficacy affects a broad range of behaviors: academic and work-related performance (Bandura et al., 2001]]; Honicke & Broadbent, 2016]]; Lane et al., 2004]]; Stajkovic & Luthans, 1998]]), athletic performance (Vargas, 2010]]; Wurtele, 1986]]), prosocial behaviors (Caprara & Steca, 2007]]; Sharma & Morwitz, 2016]]; Yao & Enright, 2020]]), and health behaviors (Grembowski et al., 1993]]; Keller, 2006]]; Strecher et al., 1986]]). For example, Park and John (2014)]] find that people tend to perform better on a strenuous handgrip exercise when they drink water from a Gatorade (vs. HydroPure) cup because the strong association between the Gatorade brand and athletic performance increases self-efficacy. If our culinary student has strong self-efficacy in the context of school, then they may perceive that their own skill is the ultimate tool for success, and they may be more likely to persist and succeed at their goal than another student with weaker self-efficacy in this domain.

Self-efficacy (and goal commitment) may be boosted by goal progress if the progress can be attributed to personal or internal factors rather than situational or external ones. In one study by Zhang and Huang (2010)]], participants pursued a goal of burning 300 calories in an exercise task. They first performed a “warm-up” task and were told that they burned either 40 calories (low progress) or 120 calories (high progress). Also, some participants were told that the number of calories burned was mostly attributable to the temperature of the room (i.e., an external factor); other participants were given no information about attribution, so they could make an internal attribution. Among the participants with high progress on the warm-up task, goal commitment (as measured by effort on the main task) was stronger for participants who could make an internal attribution. The reverse occurred among participants with low progress on the warm-up task, presumably because internal attributions of poor goal progress damaged their self-efficacy.

##### Stereotypes and Discrimination

The traits and characteristics associated with a specific identity can determine whether and how that identity might facilitate goal attainment. For example, research on stereotype threat suggests that identities can be instrumental (means) as well as detrimental (impediments) to goal pursuit (Oyserman, 2009]]; Steele, 1997]]; Wheeler & Petty, 2001]]). Stereotype threat occurs when a person’s social group or identity is viewed negatively in a domain by most of society (e.g., “women are bad at math”), such that the stereotype is internalized by everyone, including the subjects of the stereotype. The extra pressure of avoiding judgment or disconfirming the negative stereotype can hurt one’s performance, ironically reinforcing the stereotype (Stone et al., 1999]]). Spencer et al. (1999)]] find that women perform worse than men on a difficult math test; the difference in performance disappears when the test is described as “not producing gender differences,” which reduces the stereotype threat for women. The results imply that a female identity can be an impediment to STEM-related goals when the negative stereotype is salient.

The reverse can also occur—a salient positive stereotype can improve performance. Indeed, although all stereotypes can be problematic, not all stereotypes are negative. While women (vs. men) are stereotyped as having inferior quantitative skills, some societies hold a stereotype that people of Asian descent (vs. other ethnicities) have superior quantitative skills. Accordingly, Shih et al. (1999)]] find that Asian American women performed worse on a math test when their gender identity was primed (vs. not primed) but performed better when their Asian identity was primed (vs. not primed).

Beyond stereotypes, overt discrimination based on social identity constitutes a major obstacle to goal attainment for racial, ethnic, and religious minorities; women and girls; LGBTQ and gender-non-conforming people; older people; and people with disabilities or stigmatized illnesses (Al Ramiah et al., 2010]]; Colella et al., 2017]]; Horowitz et al., 2018]]). Marginalized identities may be impediments in the pursuit of goals that society deems “inappropriate” for people with the identity. For example, a 2020 report from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that less than 25% of chefs are women; according to Troitino (2020)]], less than 7% of US restaurants are led by women. The gender gap stems in part from entrenched societal beliefs that men are more adept chefs and business owners than women; women may face discrimination when applying for top positions in restaurants or soliciting investments to open new restaurants. Thus, a female identity may impede a successful career as a chef and restaurateur, while a male identity may be instrumental to such a pursuit.

### Conclusion

Goals and identities are intricately linked but typically are studied separately. This chapter integrates the previously siloed literatures to highlight the interplay between goal systems and identities (see Figure 13.5]] for a visual summary). We describe three major types of interactions between goals and identities. First, _goal systems shape identities_ because people learn about themselves from both the goals they pursue and the means they choose. Inferences drawn from goal pursuit inform identities around those goals and their outcomes. Second, _identities shape goal systems_ by providing inputs (e.g., norms, preferences, beliefs, memory accessibility) that guide choices of goals and means. Third, _identities can operate within the goal system as goals or as means_. In the pursuit of an identity goal, people may strategically engage in behaviors they consider consistent with the desired identity to signal to themselves (and others) that they possess the traits and characteristics associated with the identity. People favor goals and means that unambiguously signal the desired identity and that seem memorable, such that the behavior is highly self-diagnostic. As a means, identity can be instrumental or impedimental depending on the person’s self-efficacy and the existence of stereotypes or discrimination associated with the person’s identity in the goal context. Our analysis is a step toward developing a more comprehensive picture of the interrelated cognitive systems that support goals and identities.
