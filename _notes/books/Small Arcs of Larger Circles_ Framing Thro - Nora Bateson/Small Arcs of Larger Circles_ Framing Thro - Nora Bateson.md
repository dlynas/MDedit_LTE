There would be no book without the ideas. They have been born into language through the kneading of my heart, the bending of my mind, an undying itch to communicate. They are made presentable through the care of many eyes.

The blind spots in these pages are my own, but the sensitized areas are alive in their interplay with those people who have loved me, hurt me, inspired me, bored me, infuriated me and those who have engaged me to join them in their thinking. In my travels between institutions, disciplines, jargons and contexts I have the opportunity to find patterns that enmesh them into what we call society; and in their differences, to compare my observations. They are all here.

But the mountainsides of Big Sur, California, the scent of sage in the warm sun, the salty fog of the Pacific Ocean, and the ancient redwoods are the bible upon which I swear my truth.

While I am uncertain who to thank for this odd brew I am mixed up in, there are some people I would never have been able to complete this book without.

Of course my father was the one who opened this world up for me, but my mother, Lois Bateson, gave me the spirit of adventure to step into it. My children, Sahra and Trevor Brubeck, have taught me to relearn endlessly. They have shown me that in giving more than I ever thought I had to give I have begun to sense the raw grace of life. My grandfather, William, whom I never met in person, is here too—casting long shadows across the centuries. My cherished colleagues in the International Bateson Institute have been a fellowship of intellectual rigor, and courageous exploration into untold, unfound idea-scapes. I am grateful for these people.

There have been countless moments when I wanted to hide this manuscript under the bed and never reveal the nakedness in these pages. Money was tight, time was scant, and running around the world gathering a bouquet of impressions might not have appeared the most sensible way to proceed. In moments of distraction I repeatedly attempted to duck out of this project, but my husband, Mats Qwarfordt, softly repeated, “Where is your book?” The pages began to gather.

Then, Andrew Carey, my mirror, publisher and editor turned up. In the few pages I gave him to read one afternoon in London he saw me. Andrew made the book happen. Others began to pitch in, reading pieces and offering their efforts to help refine it. I thank Phillip Guddemi, Gail Kara, Stephen Nachmanovitch, Tomas Björkman, and Bo Ekman.

Every word of this book has been weighed and tended by Sahra Brubeck, my daughter, and Cary Long who spent the dark hours of a winter in Stockholm buried in these pages.

To Torbjörn Jiredal, Imelda McCarthy, Gail Simon, Rex Weyler, Paul King, Mark McKergow, Jenny Clarke, The Vancouver Bateson Salon and so many more: thank you.

Nora Bateson, July 2016Foreword

As Nora’s daughter I may approach her writing from a different angle than most. Having grown up in a household in which her ideas flowed seamlessly through intellectual conversations, work, play, artistic depiction and description, etc., I have had the incredible honor of watching her ideas grow and shift with time. At no point in the years that I have known her has she ever claimed that the ideas she works with are static. In all respects she remains humble and open, certain of her uncertainty. Although it is difficult to put words to the experience of being raised in a family that never placed a premium on rightness, I can say that the way my mother raised me allowed for a larger internal questioning of the notion of authority to take place throughout my childhood and adolescence. If we disagreed about a given issue at any given time, my mother was always willing to at least attempt to see the argument from my side. My opinions and contributions were not only accepted, but valued. Moreover, just as I did not expect her ideas to exist in a state of inflexibility and unchangeability, she constantly gave my ideas room to fluctuate. My mother did so without teaching me to label and categorize each thought I had into any specific discipline that might limit my ability to further understand the multitude of contexts that those ideas belonged to.

In Small Arcs of Larger Circles, I see my mother approaching topics that would often be relegated to a solely academic sphere with a form of exposure and vulnerability that is specific to her lived experiences. She actively chooses not to separate the aspects of her character that are personal from those that are political. There are moments in the text when her voice could carry the cold tone of academic contemplation, but those moments are immediately countered by her willingness to allow emotion to bleed into her words. In doing so she reminds the reader to never exclude their emotional, physical, and mental responses from the process of critical thinking. To form walls around these various aspects of the self is to deny the possibility of feeling and perceiving in more than one way at a time.

Without undermining the fact that her work comes from her own set of interpretations, she gracefully incorporates the influence of her father’s and grandfather’s work. My mother refrains from placing borders between the ideas that are “hers” and those of her family, shedding light on the truth of mutual learning that is embedded in cross-generational conversation. In doing so, she places herself into the framework of Gregory and William Bateson’s writings without claiming it as her own - or as something other than her.

After working with my mother on her film, ‘An Ecology of Mind,’ I found that she and my grandfather, Gregory Bateson, shared a similar pattern of reflective thinking. Despite the distinctness of my mother’s presence in the film - the cinematography that could exist only through her lens, the stories of relationship drawn from her memories - the film was often received as though it was simply about Gregory. The profundity of their thoughts as both individual and collective was often lost, their likeness mistaken for sameness.

The relevance of my mother’s reflections on cross-generational similarities and differences is clear to me, because I now occupy the confusing space of likeness that she addresses in her work. If you were to meet me in person, it is likely that you would notice the striking resemblance that I bear to my mother. You might be able to see traces of her in my eyes, or hear some resonance of her character in my laugh, or even mistake me for her from a distance. And though I am not ashamed in the slightest to be so similar to a woman that I admire greatly, I am wary of the possibility that people will mistake me for her entirely. I imagine my thoughts hanging in the air for mere seconds before they become entangled in her legacy, and in that moment when my words become neither mine nor hers, I am reminded of how dangerous likeness can be.

In many respects, this collection of stories, poems, and essays draws attention to the notion of individuality as it intermingles with her own complexity. Gregory’s father, William Bateson, highly influenced the ways in which Gregory learned to perceive the world around him, and that tradition of careful examination and reflection was passed down to my mother and her siblings. However, my mother’s approach to Gregory and William’s material is simultaneously similar and dissimilar to the inquiries into Batesonian ideology that have been made previously. Small Arcs of Larger Circles abounds with a true variety of literary voices and artistic explorations of the notion of multiple description. In this regard, the reader will find that my mother’s work is not devoid of pain, humility, vulnerability, or an immense amount of openness and care. Her ideas are not contained by the academic tendency to suffocate the personal in the presence of an intellectual inquiry. This is not a text that lacks courage.

Sahra Bateson Brubeck, June 2016If You Knew Me Well You Would Know That I Would Give You Everything

For you, a respite of uncontainability. Safe pages for words, to taste them as they find their rightness. Let them rest in their silky beds of lyrical dreams. Let them run like rivers down mountain-sides, arranging curves and switches where textures change along the way. Thoughts yet unmet arrive in cloaks of language, becoming bards to take you where you can see that you are wide inside.

Words are delicious, but cannot say much. They often lose the water of meaning before it is delivered. But they can be stirred to form descriptions of the breath, glances, gestures, and pulses between lives. Perhaps writing is finding a scrape in the skin of knowing, where the sting and dirt and blood of the day is let out, and music is let in.

There is no language to define the spiraling processes of the vast context we are participants in. We do not have names for the patterns of interdependency. To lock down the delicate filigree of life in explanation is to lose it, but not to see it is disastrous. Words are what we have. The why, of why we do anything at all, matters.

An inside-out kaleidoscope—a de-fragmenter—might be useful for looking at a fractured order through a lens of unity. A superhero in a comic book might have such a tool at her belt. The way we see affects what we do, in both the broad strokes of global study, and the details of a day. Playing with the limits of our perception, our knowing, and tweaking the cultural script is like using a lemon juice wash to reveal the invisible ink and unspoken scaffolding we inhabit.

The ink of interrelationship bleeds across the boundaries between professionalism, academic research, and the banality of daily life. Theory and philosophy are stained with the mundane and both are vis-à-vis. What holds this collection of sightings together? What holds anything together? Glue is superficial, so not that. Thread is better, sewing, mending the torn-apart seams of perception—possibly. It is the right question—what is holding it together?—and the question alone might be the source of inquiry. Surely a search for the elegance in a mess of weighted compensations, and river-washed shapings of the context of life, is enough of a spine. Perhaps?

The thing I want to say in this book is not in any of the pieces, but is woven by you in the way you make linkings and meta-linkings.

In the wake of human history thus far, devastation and destruction point to a misconception about the ‘way of things’ or, as some might say, the ‘order of life.’ Whatever the errors are, they are brutal to our inner worlds and the larger ecology of which we are a part. It might be that we are navigating with the wrong map. The way in which sense is made of this smorgasbord of ideas today will differ from how that same sense-making fits tomorrow. Unwritten, uncondoned.

To break away from the bricklaying of evidence-based strategic solutions is a huge risk. The loose threads of golden flexibility are a pirate’s booty of unproven and mock-able guesses. This is not allowed, and I am not qualified. Interloping across disciplines and subjects, I am just here with two eyes to see the parallax, and to blindly feel for the hidden thinkings in the bottom of a black handbag. My father, Gregory Bateson, a scientist of many shades and a thinker, has given me a great deal to work with, and hopefully to give my own extension to. I cannot know where his thinking ends and mine begins, nor do I care to draw those lines. Both of us are here, along with 3,500 years of western civilization and the long history of human evolution, wondering how to change the course of this story. Conceptually I am walking the thin glass plank barefoot—chaos peppered with elusive still points on both sides.

The depths to plunge are the abyss of love at the end of the plank. In fact, in each glimpse of this collection is a love story. These pieces are naked flirtations within a landscape of longing, a melting point of meetings in a panorama. To be a participant in a complex system is to desire to be both lost and found in the interrelationships between people, nature, and ideas. It is an infinite expansion where a small bird’s nest is tucked into the twigs of a gnarled oak tree that stands patiently atop a hillside. A pond below reflects its branches against the clouds, and tall grass is led by the wind to dance like water. They are in conversation together with us. Are there edges? The tree is in the park, which is in the city, in the Pacific Northwest, in the northern hemisphere, on a spherical globe of vitality, orbiting a larger globe of fire. Anyone’s heart is liable to be broken open by the simple poetry of the many entanglements captured in a single blink.

Written in geological calligraphy, we are swirled and looped into each other in movement and pattern. We learn together, with the trees, and the trade winds, the living maps of cities, and the soup recipes of our ancestors. Cause and effect trade hats like a shell game, losing count on purpose. The limbs of history and the future’s lust are always synchronizing.

These are the dipping breadsticks, the stewing roots and the wild herbs of my unauthorized knowings. These are living things, barely interested in the page, but swarming into warmth. In the kitchen, in the street, in the forest, in the sea, in my cells and in the cache of breaths I cannot count—there is something holding all of this together, all of us together. There is an alive order that we are within and that is within us.Breathable

In the looking, is what is seen.

The baskets to put ideas in

have open tops and holes in the sides

woven in sleepy stitchery,

loose loops cradle lightly.

‘It’ does not awake in form

but dreams willy-nilly

of the treetops reflecting the roots.

While light changes angles in water,

playing with geometry

seconds pass into songs for transport

because rain on dust is a beginning of mud

and life.Mental Mono-Cropping

Boxes, labeled and stacked, ready for a move. The unpacking will be messy. So much of what I face now can be attributed to what I have come to call ‘Mental Mono-Cropping’: generating ideas in singular fields that are bred to be resistant to cross-pollination. Education, media, and social structures present overlapping patterns of compartmentalization. Why just one concept of birth, marriage, death, friendship, work, economy, right, or wrong? To generate swathes of homogenized perception is not only zombie-like, it is a crisis of metaphor. It is, in fact, just the sort of metaphor that leads to the practice of mono-cropping agriculturally. The snake eats its tail. Evolution prefers diversity.

Specialized and separated, the ideas that so badly want to twist and frolic around each other are captive. Held in hoarded holding patterns, the poor things are braced to fear thieves.

This language and culture favor singular focus, clear definitions, and linear narratives of causation. A plus B equals C. If you do not have enough data on A and B, then you should seek the authority of the experts of either A-ness or B-ness.

But the world is not made that way. Ideas live into the architecture of culture. They take up residence and make a home. Then they stain the carpets of our minds with spilt drinks. And then one decides to protect itself from outsiders and puts locks on the doors. Ideas are not tidy guests.

On a personal level, you and I together are much, much more than one plus one. We are as many as we are able to be, and less and more. A single conversation between a married couple is evidence of enough of the shortcomings of logic. Who speaks truth?

Mental mono-cropping is imprisonment. Emancipate the ideas and they will burst into co-evolutionary bloom in a nearly unreadable knot of spiraling influences. They will be untidy in another way. They will leak into each other.

Biology is history is communication. Anthropology is architecture is agriculture is what some old women have known all their lives.

But, if expertise is specialized, then strangled, profiled ideas become the currency, and I am broke and we are broken.(inter)Facing an Ecology of Mind…

Ecology: …the totality or pattern of relations between organisms and their environment.

—The Merriam-Webster Dictionary

If you want to understand mental process, look at biological evolution and conversely if you want to understand biological evolution, go look at mental process.

—Gregory Bateson, Mind and Nature

The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water, and breeds reptiles of the mind.

—William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell

I like our garden best of all, it is bushy and happy and free… kind of in the style of 1970s’ pubic hair.

—My daughter, upon our return home, after a walk  
through our neighborhood of very manicured gardens.

The idea that ideas are fixed or permanent is just an idea, and it’s one that can change. Being stuck is a bad idea made of other bad ideas. ‘Ecology’ is often relegated to meaning simply ‘nature’ and our use of the word ‘nature’ is haunted by the implication of a human world that is separated from the environment that we need if we are to survive. This is very strange. I am not sure how this happened. It would seem to me that ecology should have bubbled up inside all the other existing realms of study and provided a sort of grey matter between them. On a good day we understand ecology as a living pattern of relationships, a co-evolving set of relational dynamics between parts of a system. We are used to seeing ecologies within elements of a landscape, or pond, or even our own body’s balancing of the functions of different organs. My father took this pattern up a level. He took it into the realm of ideas. I like to think of Steps to an Ecology of Mind as a garden of thoughts growing, changing, dying, and even composting in relation to one another. It is a dirt-under-your-nails transference of biological patterns onto conceptual and epistemological habits. ‘An Ecology of Mind,’ as a term, is a thinking tool that allows ideas to be flexible and alive in relation to one another and the outside world.

Take, for example, the body. My life is more than the sum of my digestive cycles and heartbeats. The natural world does not end with the physical or visible parts of a system. What I ate for breakfast may have been, in part, nutritionally oriented, but it was also determined by the seasons and those with whom I ate it. While digestion is surely chemical and mechanical, it is also subject to emotional conditions. Those, in turn, are part of a large field of cultivated and volunteer ideas including those that inform personal history, our cultural models of success, emotional scar tissue, and so on. The determination of something as simple as the quality of breakfast cereal is a complex idea that carries along in its wake a long string of influences ranging from developments in agriculture to physical labor and politics, to social demographics and eventually to the place we call taste… but it is just an idea made of other ideas, in a living world of ideas all pushing and pulling each other. They don’t sit still.

The term ‘An Ecology of Mind’ challenges me to ask myself: which thoughts are flourishing, which are composting, which are just budding, which are ready for harvesting? Also, I might ask myself, is this idea a seedling for a future learning, or a weed? What are the stimuli that came together to produce this idea?

Seeing that the infrastructure of my ideas resembles a garden has its benefits: I may be able to get free from the concreteness in which I seclude myself. Even to be a bystander and watch the ecology of my thoughts evolve is a step toward a larger understanding of my motivations. Familiarity with the context of my own conceptual agriculture may not solve any problems, but it does give me a little leverage with which to make choices.

Ideas change; in fact, they never stop changing. Thought patterns I assume to be permanent and pervasive—like what is a circle, identity, god, money, language, dreams—are not perceived the same way from culture to culture, or even from generation to generation. Within the semantics and vocabularies of the world’s languages entirely different emotions exist. Ideas are living things. I am suspicious about separating the intellect and the emotions. I am more comfortable with them being entangled. Not that I am condoning overthinking or intellectualizing our emotional responses, but the way we feel emotionally tells us a great deal about the way we think. I believe that it is wrong to exploit people and nature, so I am angered and saddened when I perceive exploitation. The idea and emotion are indivisible. The reverie of beauty I might perceive in a forest is an integration of several impressions, which form a vision I am moved by. But to see it in this way is not to be cold and intellect-oriented; most ideas live in the body’s reading of its environment. I know, I feel, I believe, and so I frame my knowing, feeling, and believing into a sigh, or language, or artistic expression.

Conceptual concrete is optional. There are gobs of ideas out there to get stuck on and build castles upon. They are harder to change once they become foundations for other ideas. A lightness in the way we hold thoughts gives us room to learn, to shift perspective, and to keep a rigorous humility of confusion. It is not the norm to celebrate the changing of position on an idea. There are depths at which ideas of how the world is put together are so integrated into life that they have become invisible. Those are the ones to watch out for. They sustain other ideas, and ideas about ideas. They seem unchangeable. But, pull a single thread loose and the whole tapestry can be reorganized.

To begin to think differently at this level leads to rethinking everything. It is a shift in perspective, in the way I feel, in the way I define, in the way I see the world, and what I do in it. Inevitably this kind of change leads to the arrival of a new version of myself as part of an integrated context that includes moving interrelationships with the people I love and those I don’t even know, as well as the realm of communication and the natural environment of which I am a part.

Just keep going; don’t stop. Keep pulling the thread and mental process and biological structure will come to mirror one another. A moment ago I said that ideas are living things, now I’m going on to say that living things are ideas.

If I can begin to see an ecology of my ideas, thoughts, and cognition, then I can begin to see mind in ecology. This is a big shift. The interaction of each organism in its inward and outward relation to its ecology is boggling to hold in sight. The interrelationships of the biological world are functioning with an intimacy similar to that of my own thoughts—can I not see the leaves of a plant that turn themselves toward the sun, or the seduction of the colors and perfumes of a flower that lures the bees?

The world around us is far from inert. ‘Mind’ as we are speaking of it here, in Gregory’s usage of the term, is a way of noticing the intelligence of the world under our feet. Our co-evolution with the flora and fauna is so often seen from just one perspective, but, as Michael Pollan discusses in The Botany of Desire, the plant world is not so innocent that it did not notice the dominance of the species that humanity favors. Some plants, in making themselves attractive to us have secured their evolutionary position. Biological adornment is as shameless as the adornment of the fashion world. Bees and butterflies, insects, birds, and people have color attractions that appear in plants. Did we grow to love the colors because of the plants, or did the plants increase their color because it helped their survival? Co-evolution is always biological communication.

Like the plants, and our interactions with them, forest animals are custodians of the species that serve them. We can extend to all of biology the presence of mind, and the rightful claim to an evolutionary narrative. The multiple perspectives of an ecology are the web of interaction we call biodiversity. The giant conversation that is nature will be made sense of differently by all of those present, including the protozoa. 7 billion humans, 8 billion other species, they all have another version of the relationship. Each has a perspective, each has a changing narrative, each in relation—umwelt.

An ecology of mind, and a mind of ecology—it cuts both ways. Their story, that of the other species, is my story. But ours is their story… finally a larger OUR story. Ideas are co-evolving within our epistemology and our environment, and the biological structures of our world respond in a communication pattern I am just barely able to recognize consciously. Listen carefully to the change in the patterns of the wind, to the smile of a dog, to the song of the whale, and to the microscopic organisms that hold the ocean’s species in harmony. What I am calling ‘mind’ within the body is easily visible in the intelligent compensatory behaviors of temperature regulation and metabolic equilibrium. But an extension of that compensatory communication to the question ‘do trees think?’ reveals a sticking point in our thought garden that we would do well to weed out.

The eye altering alters all

—William Blake, ‘The Mental Traveller’

I am an ecology within ecologies. Who are you? And what thoughts are we fertilizing together? How is thinking being reflected back through relationships with others, including the other species? We might have an ecology of culture, ecology of linguistics, ecology of economics, and so on. The notion that nature (not us) has the burden of ecology to contend with, while we ‘thinking’ humans insist that we’re the only species capable of making meaning—this is an argument about cognition that will point most people to the brain. The mind and the brain are not the same thing. One is in the head, and the other is spread everywhere.

![[p18-01.jpg]]Identity with an I

Who am I? Grammar incorrectly suggests that I am singular. A verb conjugation for plural first person is missing—not for we, but for I.

That singularity is a semantic, ideological, epistemological, cultural, biological, ecological, evolutionary, epigenetic, gender specific, nationalistic error.

That singularity is a great violence, and silence to all that I am in plurals. The pronouns are misleading. ‘I’ carries the suggestion that I am somehow individual, independent, when interdependence is the law.

‘We’ seems to be a more inclusive choice, but it erases the multiplicity of perspectives. Which ‘we’? ‘We’ as in western civilization, (whatever that is), or humanity, or the entirety of life? What does ‘we’ mean? As a white girl I better be damned careful with ‘We’—assuming the right to speak to experiences I do not, cannot know. ‘We’ is less independent, but not conducive to multiple mutual learning.

‘You’ separates us, points a finger, sets us up for confusion.

‘They’ is an illusion. ‘Us’ is somehow not ‘them.’

When I lived in Thailand I learned to use pronouns to reveal relationship, but it was so complicated I finally just began to use my name. “Nora is hungry, Nora is your friend.” Third person, first person, second person, all at once.

Perhaps using all the pronouns will generate a healthy confusion. I am we are you includes they. My childhood English teachers are rolling their eyes.

Let them. The world is burning. We are not seeing the integrity of life. Grammar needs to evolve.

What there are no words for is often un-seeable. Can you see the plurals that I am? I presume you have some of the same plurals. That presumption makes you hard to define.

Here are mine: Me, I, Nora. You, am, are…

Over 10 trillion organisms make their community in and on my body. I cannot live without them.

They are in my eyelashes and brows, they are on my skin, they are in my mouth, in my organs.

My gut is home to billions of living things without whom I could not digest my food. I would not have energy for my metabolism; I would be suffering great enzymatic and other imbalances. I would die.

Nine out of ten cells in my body are inhuman and belong to the larger ecology.

All of those creatures live in and on me.

My health is their health; their health is my health.

When they are hungry I am hungry, when I eat too much sugar they overproduce in particular populations.

My mood, my urges, my instincts are enfolded with them.

I am not only what is in my body, I am also my personality, my culture, my emotions, my spirit.

Finding where exactly the outside world ends and I begin—is not so easy.

My culture influences so much:

My ideas, my language, my eating habits, my music, my clothing, my education.

And somehow, under closer scrutiny none of those things has a clear root either.

Languages are compiled across time and movements of people,

As are recipes,

And religious traditions.

Even plants and animals move around the globe.

A child of the North American 20th century I can identify with rock & roll.

But music too is a combination of so many histories,

Instrument-making that includes the Middle East, Asia, Africa, England, the US,

And the special voices of talent that have touched it on the way.

Look closely and there is no exact root, no ‘there’ to be found at the core of rock, or classical music, or the music of any other culture.

Surely then, I must be what I know.

Knowledge is how I can define and separate myself.

I am who I am because of what I know.

However the clarity of what knowledge is is questionable,

My experiences are all framed and digested through the particular lens that my culture, my family, my fears, my breakfast have all helped to edit.

My education is the strange collection of tools that have been selected as important.

But education now is not what it was 100 years ago, not what it will be 100 years from now.

What is it important to teach the young coming into a society?

Well, that depends on the society, doesn’t it?

So the education that has been chosen is fitted into what has been decreed as valuable information for our way of life.

Yet, we seek to live differently than those who have come before.

‘Who am I?’ is a question that contains a treacherous mistake: it presumes I am independent.

It is a lonely, lost question.

That ‘I’ can be Isolated, Insulated, Ignored. That ‘I’ can be Insignificant.

I can imagine that I am just the person in my head and the skin bag I live in, pretending that I am not:

my mother and my father,

my children and my friends,

the food I have eaten and the thoughts I have thought,

the heat of the sun and the mold in the earth,

the streaming water.

I am the embers in the fire,

A microbiome of 10 trillion creatures,

the land, ideas, and names of my nation,

the current embodiment of 200,000 years of homo sapiens movement around the globe,

a traveler, a filmmaker, a mother, a researcher, a friend, an artist, a cook, a photographer, a poet,

70% water,

the rest is mostly muscle and tissue, bones and squishy stuff.

Still, the me in the skin-bag is me. I love, I think, I learn, I communicate, I reproduce, I give.

I am an integrating process of variables interacting.

Integrating in integrity.

Integrity with an I.

Integrity is loyalty to the ambiguity of my own edges, and permission for you to be blurry too. I do not need precision to know myself, or you. I need room for all of our selves to hold counsel.

I ‘am’ complex.

I am a dream.

I am an ecology of selves.

We, the internal aquarium of trillions of creatures, my language, my culture, my love, my ideas, my family, my nation, and my breakfast—ARE. And we ARE not separable from the particular version of a person that is me.

We were fed an illusion that we could choose a singular identity.

We cannot continue this illusion.

Choose a new perception of identity, or justify the singular nationalism, the walls, the edges of reduction around definitions of gender, race, profession, religion, and live in a battlefield between false nations, false identities, false separations.

Before all else we are of the ecosystems.

‘I’ will be different tomorrow. So will you, all of you, us, they.We are Wine

Steeped in history, building a shadowy bouquet,

Unable to reassemble ourselves as grapes,

We are wound into a richness we cannot undo.

Beautiful still, and with a destiny that is vaguely related to vines—

We still know water and wind.

We know the stories of the keepers of the casks,

We know versions of civilizations that sing.

There is goodness.

A look to a future of solutions is a potion table of bubbling mysteries,

Soaked in folded learnings, lost threads, unseen outcomes.

We are not

And yet

We are grapes always.Policy for Governance in the Future

This is a letter I wrote to my friend and colleague Anders Wijkman. He was given the job of chairing a Task Force on developing a climate strategy for 2050 by the Swedish Government. In our conversations he was fraught with questions about how one could even imagine what technologies, issues, and crises a society would face 35 years from now. His plight was poignant.

I have left this in letter form instead of turning it into an essay because I want the relationship to be visible. The communication of these questions is in itself a part of what the policy we make thirty to forty years from now will reveal—perhaps. Who knows? The meta-message I suppose is mostly about having pondered and poked around in the unsayable territories of rhetoric that do not yet exist. Or, maybe it’s just a game of imagining. That is ok too.

Dearest Anders,

I woke up thinking about your conundrum today. The future… how to know what we will need. What is policy going to be even in 35 years? How do we account for the shiftings in technology, culture, and ecology between now and then?

I am sitting in the Aurora lounge at Arlanda Airport. 26 minutes till boarding for my plane to London. I am teaching for a few days… I have 26 minutes to avoid my kilometers of emails and think about your dilemmas instead of mine.

At the risk of wasting your time, I thought I would jot down some thoughts for you on what strikes me:

In the work that I am doing, I am afforded a unique opportunity to be an interloper, hopping between professions and disciplines, visiting the language and the details of many points of reference in our world. Some days I am with ecologists, or educators, or doctors, or psychologists, or architects, or artists, or…. What I have noticed is that I am faced continually with the same question, the same flavor of crisis, the same pattern. It does not seem to matter what ‘sector’ or subject or discipline I am working in.

The problems that are arising are the result(s) of the fragmented way that we assess the world. The subsequent actions and decisions we make are based on this limited view, and of course lead to trouble in the not very long run.

But the trouble seldom appears where it started. Such is the nature of complexity. So the child whose education system fails him ends up with psychological problems; the poverty that creates hunger statistics results in ecological mistakes like GMOs and water pollution; the ecological issues result in health issues, as drought moves populations, pesticides are connected to cancer, and so on.

You know all of this. I am just laying it out.

The issue is that the approach to our complex world is out of sync.

Is it possible to create policy for the future that uses another approach? Can we demand that any decision be researched through a process that articulates the integration of the matter in question through at least three sectors?

The policy we are contending with now is faulty, but not in the way we might imagine. The underlying metaphors of our culture hold true to the logic of industrial causation and mechanized interaction. Life is not like that. Can we change the policy of the future to adopt another way of thinking about the problems? Can we make some rules of engagement that expand the understanding within and between institutions so that they must consider the larger ecologies that they exist within?

I say ecologies because the multiplicity is so important. The ecology of the family, the ecology of culture, of integrating humanity, and of our interaction with the ecology we call nature.

An immune system is a political territory. Perhaps if politicians had to advocate for the immune systems of their people it would give a better perspective on what the linkages of survival and thriving survival actually account for.

The happiness, the intellectual and emotional realms of wellbeing, (as opposed to traumas), possibility of employment, cultural identity within the whole, and the parts of our globe, the diet, the bacterial communing within the larger ecology, the database of disease, the importance of diversity…. Such are the criteria of immune systems. Can politics hold those in view?

Perhaps this is all just old hat. But I want you to know that I am thinking of you and your very important task. To think of the future now is an act of optimism at the highest order, and to really engage in that thinking is to take on a meta level of dignity… the dignity of dignity, of all of life in integration.

What are the patterns of thinking that we have to address? They are really messing up everything… there are no shortcuts in an ecology. Each damaged linkage represents errors in our understanding of our world. How can we better prepare the political body to make decisions that are less destructive?

Of course, all of this is why I am creating the IBI… I see this need for information that is integral—and I hope to do what I can to provide a method for tending to this level of thinking…. Hopefully to influence in some small way the APPROACH to the situations we face.

All my love

Plane boarding….

Hugs, NNourishment

History is reframed by the future. Seeds to food to seeds to food; the generosity of nourishment recycles in overlapping timelines and blended eras.

What is ‘An Ecology of Food?’ When we ask more simply ‘What is food?’ the most complete answer includes a complex network of relationships that function interdependently to create a meal. This complex network can be seen as an ecology. Food illustrates a multi-faceted process of production alongside distribution that requires the input of energy, economics, environment, agriculture, and technology in relationship with the social interaction found in medicine, education, commerce, and media.

In Rome once, I had dinner at a friend’s house and each ingredient had a story. The table was spread wide with platters, hardly leaving room for our plates. Each cheese had a protocol including particular knives and specific crackers. The other guests declared their hometowns with accompanying descriptions of local meats and pastas. Vinegar from Modena, cheese from Palermo… But what floored me was that one of the guests knew the ancestry of the seeds in the breads. She was able to give me a complete account of where the seeds originated, and with which techniques they were customarily ground in which provinces.

These grains were whole. Intact in their biological form, and organic of course, in their history—they had never been touched by the laboratories of engineered agriculture. The host, a doctor, said they were easier to digest. With each bite we joined a continuum of generations of farmers who cultivated those seeds—generations of mamas and mamas of mamas who ground the grain, baked it, and passed down an evolution of recipes improved along the way. The seeds, the bread, the stories, the gatherings of loud laughter across time all nourishing the strong bones of their children… and their children’s children. Such was this meal in the Eternal City.

I question now the metaphor in which seeds represent beginnings. Seeds of change, seeds of hope, and so on. Of course, in a world of linear thinking that would be the meaning ascribed to seeds. But hold on. Seeds lead us just as much into what came before as into what comes next. The bread we ate was rich with the continuum of tables that the seeds brought bread to. The seeds are the interface, the lateral lineage, the present that is part of a past and a future. I had never thought about seeds in that way before. I never noticed that they are travelers. Seeds are not only beginnings, they are witnesses and referees to evolution. They are immigrants, hitchhiking with the cultural fusions that migrations of animals and peoples make. Taking their bread with them. Taking grandma’s recipes. Seeds get caught in your fur if you are a wolf, and take a whole winter to run though the digestion of a bear.

All of that is to say nothing of the spectrums of flavors in that meal. I left feeling I had eaten enough for a week. But I woke with a deep ache in my belly. Not from the food, but from the sadness of knowing what I had not known. I had never imagined a history of seeds in bread. I had forgotten that history entirely—skipped over it, lost it. I had been robbed of the stories that the seeds carry. My bread at home comes in a plastic bag from a shelf, or at best is made from bulk food section organic flour from the health-food store. I had never tasted legacy. Sideswiped by the epiphany that the ingredients of our lives have tales to tell, the parallels began to open.

Telescoping in on the details of ordinary ‘stuff’ that following day I caught a few threads of the distant past as it has come to be. One thread was at the hem of my skirt, leading to the dark warehouse of a sweatshop somewhere in China. At one time I am sure my ancestors knew how to spin that thread, and a simple dress was a tapestry of skills that I know almost nothing of. I have a sewing machine I never use.

What am I made of?

Politically of course, the level of nourishment I experienced in Rome that night is leagues away from the rally against GMOs. Nourishment beyond the chop-wood-carry-water, co-op spirit. Depleted of stories, our deep hunger is insatiable. No wonder everyone is stuffing themselves to gluttonous sizes. In the obscene wealth of the modern western world, impoverishment stalks the cupboards and haunts the table. Still, I have a cheesecake recipe that came from my mother’s mother. We have traditions we carry and supply to the next generations. Bereft as it is, the dinner table is still the place where the natural world meets the realm of ideas; it is the watering hole of the body, mind and heart. It’s the oasis and the place of healing for the family and the step-family.

Food is not just food; it is also conversations. The sustenance of voices is its own nutrition. Children are watching, listening, interrupting, and learning the art of jumping in and out of a moving stream of verbal and nonverbal communications.

The children are learning what we hold to be good about life, as well as where the de-railings are. All of this while we are simultaneously registering the weather outside, the change of seasons, the socio-demographics and cultural aesthetics of the family, and the changes in one another’s moods.

At dinner the patterns of our communication come unfurled, table setting, company present, and the warmth of togetherness. My daughter dances with me in the kitchen while we chop veggies and stir sizzling garlic. My son likes to light the candles as his contribution to the table, a budding pyromaniac. Mutual learning is rich at dinner. Stories unfold, perhaps not of the seeds in the bread, but of the day. Plans for the following day are made. We may be dangling in a cultural free-fall, but we eat together every night, and that alone feels like a revolutionary act at times.

Food is agriculture, economy, culture, and conversation, ancestral recipes, weavers of tablecloths, traditions of seasons, the perfect onion, a child’s berry-stained chin… Food is poetry, medicine, friendship, time, poison, economy. Ask the question ‘What is food?’—and the answer is not ‘the stuff on my plate.’ The answer is that food is about relationships. These relationships are formed between generations that plant together, between man and nature, between the family members who eat together; it is in the conversation, in the heritage of the weaver who makes the baskets used to take food to market in neighboring villages. It is in the relationship between towns economically. Seeds used in ceremony represent longterm linkages between people, nature, cycles, and attitudes toward the future.

Nothing will ever match the chocolate gelato I had that night in Rome, made with 84% cacao imported from the Amazon. It was dark chocolate artistry that accidentally slipped though the infinite perfection of cultural, geographical, and inspirational fusion: frozen deliciousness melting time and memory.

![[p30-01.jpg]]Rain

I am outlining you in my reflection,

Breathing on the window pane of your lens

And with my finger

Drawing.

The choice I make is you.

My furnace warms the air into a message.

On you it makes the specks of chill on your chest smooth,

Receiving my transmission.

You dawn on me like something I have always known

Under a sudden spot light

I forget that I ever forgot you.

Because I chose you then.

When we were unwound threads,

Spun in colors we could not yet see.

Wayward – as the riotous weave bore story,

Distracted in dust storms of denouement,

We were shaken off into nearly lost.

But not unchosen.

Now, a windshield wiper on the glass of odyssey,

Reveals the rain

Sweeping decades into sparkly droplets.

Putting the light to music as it traces us in our return.Knowledge and Complexity

From a talk I gave at Università Roma Tre in December 2013

The problem of how to find a voice that has credibility on the topic of uncertainty is enough to keep a person up at night.

I cannot very well stand here, amongst all of you esteemed and learned people and announce that I am most likely wrong about everything I say. But if I am not wrong today, I probably will be in six months. No one is qualified to talk about uncertainty. You cannot get a degree in it yet, to the best of my knowledge. This is an unsanctioned discussion: outside the limits, under the radar, over the top, and you probably should not listen. How, after all, can I pretend to offer you any kind of lesson on what I do not know?

At least I can say there is no one else who is more suited to the job. In this territory we are all equal. No hierarchy holds water in this discussion. No one has to take notes. No one has to be right, no one has to remember what is said. There will not be a test.

When raccoons go searching in the mud for little edible things, they reach down into the dark holes of roots in a creek-bed, and feel around for something. They hold whatever they find and rub their fingers around the outside of it to get an idea of the shape, to feel the textures, and to gather information. I hope that today we can be a little like those raccoons, and that our findings will be treasures from the edges of our topic.

We are here to talk about the noble and important realm of knowledge. We are not the first to set our sights on this horizon, nor will we be the last. I would like to ask you to pause and examine what comes to mind. What is your initial sense of knowledge? Don’t get tricky, just glance inward and take a quick look at the ambience of your sense of knowledge.

Today’s task is not specific, but it is also not unspecified. We are talking about knowledge in complexity. Not particularly about any discipline of the academy, nor any professional know-how, nor even a human hunch. But perhaps something in-between, something inclusive of all of those faculties. And while there will not be a test, it is probably true that our ability to know and to make sense of our world underlies everything we do, including walking across the room, looking at a photograph, or picking up a flower petal. In that sense there is a test, and it is measured by our capacity for getting from one day to the next. It should be noted however that much of that knowledge—and the knowing processes needed—lie beneath our conscious states of awareness.

That may not have been the knowledge that you reflected upon a few moments ago. But for the sake of looking at ‘how nature thinks’ let’s look at how knowledge functions at that level as an example of how an ecology knows. The body is an ecology.

To walk across a room is quite a feat. It requires measurement in our muscles and alignments in our perception that merge with memory and movement to navigate a process of balancing into and between steps. It requires relaxation of parts of our bodies and engagement of others. We must want to cross the room! It requires a bit of chaos, and it requires organizing our bodies, minds, and emotions in the environment—as well as all our perceptions and a hundred details of cognition. It requires them all to come together to do this simple task—and some of you will do it in high heels. Amazing.

The complex system that is the body is a field of ways of knowing, all of which work together ecologically to provide the necessary information. The body does so at such a deep level that we are not aware of even half of the information we are utilizing. As an ecology, the body is comprised of parts and processes that function together and it knows that, in order to know, it must take in a relational understanding of every kind of information, sanctioned and unsanctioned, to get across the room. The body is gathering multiple perspectives, like that of the toes, the eyes, the hips, the knees, the shoulders and the tone of voice that someone uses to speak to you. The long arms of science can reach some of this knowing, but the body goes well beyond. It also sources information from the emotions, the culture, the memory, the nature of rhythm, the sound of footsteps and so on.

And it’s learning as it goes. That part is difficult to chart on paper and it’s impossible to successfully walk across the room without it.

To gasp at the unspeakable beauty of this process is perhaps the only appropriate response. The nexus of relationships that is providing knowing to a single minute gesture is ecological. It is intricate and intimate. It is the totality of patterns and relationships that any organism lives within. The combined contributions of all of the parts of an ecology, each in mutual response to the others, provide a masterpiece of living art. Alive. And to be alive is to be part of this ecology of relations, ideas, and communications with the surrounding world.

Knowledge in complexity is in itself an ecological process. Knowledge, when given this field of ecological characteristics to grow in, is alive; it requires and learns from the ideas that are brought forth from other ideas. The conversation of ideas in an ecological context gives rise to new ideas, and so on. The knowing is multi-directional.

But what are the dynamics of the integrity of such a system? How do all the pieces come together? Chaos and order. Structure and openness. The pattern that connects, as my dad called it, requires both process and form; it is part rigid and part imaginative. To study it, our first step is to remember that we are in fact part of the pattern, inside the ecology, and allow our inquiry to take another shape. My dad offered:

I want to emphasize that whenever we pride ourselves upon finding a newer, stricter way of thought or exposition; whenever we start insisting too hard upon ‘operationalism’ or symbolic logic or any other of these very essential systems of tram-lines, we lose something of the ability to think new thoughts. And equally, of course, whenever we rebel against the sterile rigidity of a formal thought and exposition and let our ideas run wild, we likewise lose. As I see it, the advances in scientific thought come from a combination of loose and strict thinking, and this combination is the most precious tool of science.

Gregory Bateson, Steps to an Ecology of Mind

Knowledge is a quest that has dominated our imaginations for thousands of years. It is how we come to understand our world. How we make sense. But as I look around I see a great deal of misunderstanding—a great deal of information floating around, and even more being generated in the form of big data, little data, medium data. But not much in the forms of the warm data of interrelationality. Warm data is a term we use in the International Bateson Institute to describe information about relationships rather than numbers. We have only just begun to experiment with how to gather such data.

The promise of increased knowledge is that it might help us to solve the problems we face. But the problem with problem-solving is the idea that a solution is an endpoint. There are no endpoints in complex systems, only tendrils that diffuse and reorganize situations… compensations come in crooked streams and don’t end up where you thought they would. DDT stopped insects briefly, then became problematic in countless other ways. Increasing the water resources of a city meets the needs of the people, but increases the population potential. Treating symptoms, teaching to the test, gathering statistics… all of these forms of engagement have something in common… blindness to the complexity of the issue being addressed.

Ah, why do we do that? Look back. There are lots of reasons, of course; many threads. But here is one to play with. The story of the Gordian Knot is a myth that runs like a subterranean internet of crooked streams surfacing invisibly through the decisions and solutions of the last 3,000 years of history, steeped in policy and language, in heroism and in philosophy, technology, medicine, economics, architecture, agriculture….

Stories, poems, and myths are to be revisited and sometimes reinterpreted. Alexander the Great may have made a great big mess. Consider this. The story goes that Midas gave the Phrygians a chariot that was tied to a post. The knot that tied the chariot did not have an end to it. No one could untie it, and it grew in renown to be a puzzle which could be solved only by the next great ruler. In 333 BCE Alexander the Great came to try his hand at the puzzle (it would have been bad luck not to). He could not untie the knot. Finally, he asked if there were rules as to how he was to loosen it, and found that there were not, so… with a single swipe of his sword Alexander cut the knot, freed the chariot, and tangled our thinking. Short-term reward, long-term damage: greed over curiosity.

I wonder if the real gift was the poetic chariot—not the one tied to the post, but instead the vehicle of perception that could carry a vision of how nature works, how evolution happens, how things grow, how learning emerges…. It was the art itself of the paradox: the chariot is an obvious symbol of movement, and the knot, symbol of entwinement… linked forever. Loose and strict, chaos and order, knowledge lies in the paradox of these polarities, and the paradox should not be solved. The knowing is only possible in the aesthetic of uncertainty which will inform not just our findings, but the process of our searching. No cut pieces, no quick solutions—complexity demands a more engaged inquiry to explore the patterns that connect.

In short, the Gordian knot was an image of the pattern that connects. It was a map of life. The gift was a gift of metaphorical guidance. When the knot is hacked in two, a binary is born and the poem is lost—not solved, but truncated. The chariot becomes the chariot and the post is post, mono-cropped into separation. In the cleverness of this solution the poetry is broken.

This brings us back to the problem of authorizing uncertain, unacademic, unknowable, and unanswered knowledge. Being wrong and not knowing are assets. These traits are not dismissals of serious study, but instead offer an invitation to the diversity of perspectives within a diversity of contexts… a much wider pool to play in.

![[p36-01.jpg]]Crispy Dry Moods

Index fingers knot as we pass in the kitchen,

Touching your angles.

Crispy dry moods lose their snap

Too long saturated in time’s dampening

Deferred is metallic anger in a flash, a flame

That could have burned in earthen honesty

Say dammit,

Crack the crust off

Shatter the pattern

But then some routine fungus fuzzes in

Catches gravity in grooves

Lands all the fierce spears softly

The everyday spirit drenchers spread in even layers

Meanwhile, waves smash against the sides of the day

Judgments, impatience, creep through the promise of love

And enter the alchemy

Symmetry lifelessly tucks the corners, smooths the countertops

But that’s ok.

It’s ok.

I will see your crackle, and fan it,

I would rather rescue the crashing swell from its detour

Collide with boulders

And applaud the majesty of far flung droplets sprayed in triumph

Wildness in unfolded, unmeasured glory

The salve of the tiger unframed

Is the gentleness of your hands.It Goes Without Saying

Within the great whirl of life there is culture; in culture there is language; in language there is conversation; in conversation there are two beings; in the beings there are frames of perception and, in their communication, a kaleidoscope of unpredictable repatterning. Impossibly, in that conversation, the world is simultaneously held together and blown apart. Communication is a precarious cliff climbing through theme and variation. Even when it seems like the same language is being spoken, there are a million possible interpretations of the words used. Alongside the verbal efforts, expression and tone are applied like traffic signals, pointing the listener towards the intended meaning. But it is the meaning-maker inside the listener who defines the relationship. What they hear, their connotations, the vocabulary of their experience is what filters the speaker’s careful attempts. Once spoken, words are free to land where they will. The plotted configurations of language patterns are like train tracks guiding the illusion of a script, while really both speaker and listener are sliding, flailing—sometimes into separate dreams, sometimes into stochastic grace, hopefully into learning. What a remarkable event it is to sculpt and shape a smile around words, a frown into intonations, to paint history in pauses, and inscribe meanings in the melody of eye contact. Hands, warm and worn with the work of life, hold the gestures that heart and mind form through observation. A simple greeting, a drunken disclosure, a caffeinated philosophical rant, the tender confessions of lovers, are all portions of nourishment on the banquet table of belonging. Together, as speaker and listener, we are both lost and found in our contact, researching the edges of one another’s lives to reveal a portrait of our own outlines. Where am I in you? Where are we in the eons of history? How do we travel through this emotional and intellectual landscape? Are you kindred? Are you safe?

Navigating the topography of agreement and disagreement is as dizzying as a foreign metro station. Which level are we really looking for a home in? At the level of detail we cannot help but make entropy of meanings and intents. Between what was said and how it was heard there is a chaotic fluttering and bouncing of variables. The vast distances between our perceptions cast us into places we did not mean to go; into puddles of muck and confusion. Like a skateboard ridden by a stiff and brittle adult, the words slip from underneath us. Being misunderstood is painful, and sometimes amusing, depending on whether it feels like betrayal or befuddlement. Either way, the likelihood of someone else understanding us is slim, especially given that we hardly understand ourselves as we change from one minute to the next. In this storm of unpredictable possibilities, it is hard to be sure that we even know what we are agreeing or disagreeing upon. William Shakespeare made it his business to study tragic and comedic human misunderstandings.

Is it possible to be entirely certain of uncertainty? At the level in which we are participants in a larger context, there is a kind of symmetry and grace that we are drawn toward. It is an exquisite harmony unfolding over long narratives that we cannot see. There are moments of union, where we sync up and meet with the indisputable force of a car crash. There will be no cynical diminishing of our birthright to connection. Recognition is a warm relief found in a flash of communion within ourselves, with babies, animals, those we love, strangers, a piece of music, or the chill of the wind. We know when it happens, with or without words. In that instant we are speaking, and we are spoken to. We can be heard. We can see and be seen. Inextricably, we are part of something both enormous and tiny; a unity that our cells, our bellies, and our aesthetic senses know without need of any authorization. If our conversation is a kaleidoscope, the silence between us is rich dark chocolate and we can eat our words. Be quiet and say something. It is a feeling so real that it defines the reality we create.

Touching the unity we are part of is a profoundly beautiful aspect of being alive. So, of course we want more. We want to catch all the agreement butterflies everyday, all year long. Can the potential isolation of living on an island of our own frame of reference be banished by simple concurrences that become the currency of our conversation? There is tension in the balance of navigating individual frames of perception in a world made of interdependent relationships. We are separate but remain un-separated. The carrot dangled by the ancient tradition of winning someone over with rhetorical persuasion may or may not be proof that we can identify with one another. At the end of our discussion we take stock. Do we agree, or disagree? Are we understood? As though agreement were an indicator of our capacity to share the lost continents of our souls.

In between the slippery details and breathtaking beauty of a larger context, there are rules about how the conversation itself is organized. What are the tacit cultural, linguistic, religious, and educational guidelines for conversing? Where are the limits of our script? The thing said, and the style of saying it, give indications as to what the communication will be. The ‘what’ in what we are talking about is underlined in the personality of the way it is said. Is it a formal discussion with the parameters of that discourse? A poem? Or giggly girl-talk punctuated with the zing of joking pokes? The restrictions of the conversation are a contract mutually chosen, usually nonverbally. Much like picking a mode of travel, the rules by which we choose to engage direct the variables of rhythm. Formal academic style, for example, has a whole world of rules of engagement, which underpins not only the content of what is said but where and with whom the communication is offered. The overtones of colonialism inherent in academic style preclude other voices of knowledge. There will be no footnotes in the lyrics of a folksong, the healing touch of a mother, or the wry wit of a storyteller. Stone walls of jargon are raised to keep trespassers from mixing metaphors. To get to new ideas, new forms of conversation are necessary.

These walls function as a cartography of the conversation. We use them to gain a sense of place and expectation within the dialogue. Once the borders have been accepted they can be played with. But, like table manners, you have to know the rules before you can break them. My father often spoke about play, using the example of the puppies tussling in a game of play biting. The meaning of the bite, while it referred to a real act of aggression, was understood to be just that, a playful reference. “The playful nip,” he said, “denotes the bite, but it does not denote what would be denoted by the bite.” The room for play exists in a given relationship precisely because of an agreement on what the mood of the communication is, and what it is not.

‘Is’ and ‘is not,’ ‘yes’ and ‘no,’ ‘agree’ and ‘disagree,’ ‘right’ and ‘wrong,’ ‘creation’ and ‘destruction,’ these are polarities that have the wiles of seduction on their side. The skin of words contains the body politic, and the dogma of our categories is easy to dress up as profound. Suddenly our agreements become signifiers of who we are and what we represent in a static analysis of how the world is put together. There is much to invest there. Banking on agreement we double down, collude, and create normalcy. We passionately align with subsets of culture, belief, and values. These are the things we fight for, the things worth dying for. But how can we be so sure we are seeing the same thing? My teenage daughter once offered a response for me in a discussion where I was asked if my father believed in God. “Yes or no? Yes or no?” the questioner insisted, as though agreement and disagreement were a binary option. My daughter reminded the questioner that there are billions of people on this planet, each with their own epistemological frame, and their own personal understanding of god—each of them unlike any other. “Which one are you referring to?” she asked. The ‘right or wrong’ answer, the ‘yes or no,’ the ‘with me or against me’ is, at this level, a vulgar displacement of what could have been exchanged. It costs dearly to taste the exhilaration of belonging at that level; to trade agreement for possibility is an expensive exchange.

With her cheeky reply, my daughter mapped another island in which agreement and the community of like minds stopped being a respite of comfort and company, and became a line, a sharp knife to cut us apart. Our perceived agreement with one group tears us asunder from another. Interestingly, in that feedback loop, agreement and disagreement define each other. To choose one of the two is to truncate the time to explore the beauty in our differences. We have agreed either to agree or disagree, smearing a toxic glue whose fumes are caustic to compassion. A more agile suspension of the quick-dry cement we apply to meaning might be an invitation to open the box of interpretations. What is in there? In the example of the question about god, there is ample room for offense and defense, or alternatively the option to step back and see a broad spectrum of versions of what another person holds sacred. The latter is a much more interesting approach.

Is it not ironic? Disagreement is what we are trying to avoid, and the cause to which we attribute conflict. Recursively, the distinction between agreement and disagreement begins to reveal that they are the same thing. Disagreement is the product of agreement in another Venn diagram. Agreement forms boundaries of inclusiveness, the flip side of which is exclusivity. Agreement without its smokescreen of optimism starts to look like the cause of disagreement, and disagreement is the root of another agreement.

If the terms of the communication are redrawn to seek consensus, not at the level of detail, but at the level of the rewards of the conversation itself, a shift can happen. The weight of the conversation changes when we are not at risk of eviction from the temple of togetherness.

I had a dear friend once who was from Thailand and, due to language challenges and cultural differences, we often found ourselves in dire disagreement. But we established a kind of invisible bucket to put those experiences in, where we could simply label them ‘impossible to untangle’ and move on. What was interesting is that we did not expect to understand one another. Later, back home, I realized that in fact I have little more understanding of my English-speaking close friends and kin than I did of my Thai friend. More importantly, I was in the habit of believing otherwise. I thought that since we came from the same culture and spoke the same language we would and should have less confusion about one another’s intentions. On closer inspection, this was not the case at all. What I learned was that freedom of perspective removes the torture of mismatched expectations and this lessens the disappointment of non-linking, in friendships, marriage, and work.

While it’s hard to resist, seeking agreement at the level of detail suffocates the ecological possibilities of the conversation. My father used to say, “The new comes out of the random.” Mutual learning happens in the entropy; we need the confusion to release the new. This dance exists everywhere in nature. It is the swarm of confusion that becomes the grace of the way things come together. The individual paradoxically is both erased and brought to another kind of existence in noticing her participation in a larger context. In the space between the instrument, the musician, the notes, the audience, and silence, the song arrives. It is not in the instrument, nor is it in the musician, nor in the silence. The notes on the page are a map, not a territory. New meanings, new levels of understanding, come pouring into combinations born of our eagerness for contact.

Minds, great or otherwise, do not think alike; they echo back and forth, in responses to responses. In biology, codes and signs exist in living organisms as means by which to transmit relational information. But they are nothing until they are interpreted, and the interpretation sets in motion the next round of signaling. These signals are widespread, and may start at the minute level of a simple enzyme. Zoom out, and the enzyme can be seen in relation to the diet, season, and wellbeing of the creature and its environment. There is no agreement or disagreement, only a mind-boggling algebra of possible actions and reactions in messages. The stories are ever-changing.

Where does the change come from? To accommodate the possibility for change, the intellect must grow two sizes. But it is also a matter of the heart. There is no potential for a formula of communication. There is no script or vocabulary that will unlock the doors of understanding. Ultimately, the measure of the exchange lies in caring. Not just between individuals, although that is certainly important, but caring about the process of how learning together happens through interrelationships. It is about gentleness toward the delicate interdependencies of the entire context of life. A jungle of ideas, teeming with life, lies in-between what I thought I meant and what you heard. Attending to the intricate relationships that weave the context together requires a kind of perception that is formed in tenderness. Meaning morphs right out of the mud like protozoa. Unknown creatures of our creativity crawl onto the soil of the wisdom we make together. This is an exercise in both aesthetics and ethics. Infinite learning and expansion of our understanding bubbles in the mutations of our meanings. But the entrance into the great whirl will not be drawn into blueprints, because it is written into the empathy we have for the nature of life itself. Our delight in the accidental evolution of our discussion in itself denotes a ‘value system.’ Relationships between meanings pop into entirely unforeseen contexts, and little shifts and big discoveries lie in waiting. The sun that warms the seeds of misunderstanding so that they may bloom into mutual learning—that sun is courageous affection.

All manner of thing shall be well.

—Julian of Norwich

Rivers coursing over landscapes meet and fold their molecules in muscles of current,

Without yield, without stacking one sandbag against the surge.

I ask you to be strong, strong enough to release your hold against turbulence.

A forest of trees, each leaf a receptor for the caress of the wind, is wealthy in sensations.

I ask you to be rich, banking each whisper of affection against the poverty of numbness.

I am a pool of water, cupped in your palms, your reflection flickers on my surface, wobbly in the movement of light.

I ask you to have courage to see yourself there, transparent, clean, as I see you.

For one second, for a million years. A city skyline of jagged grace is held against the same clouds the dinosaurs pondered,

I ask you to be loyal to your own transformations, while I shift and twist in mine.Old Growth Redwoods

We have been lost to each other for so long.

—Anita Diamant, The Red Tent

Lineage is not linear.

At first, I thought I was just me. Wild and wicked and alone. Then I recognized MY ideas in my father’s work, and had to succumb to the probability that through osmosis or teaching—or something—there had been a transmission. Then I discovered through my children that my father was influenced greatly by his father—in a Möbius strip of generational contexts.

I began to think that intergenerational learning goes backward and forward as well as following diagonal trajectories. It is difficult to be sure whether what we know has reframed what we used to know, or if what we used to know has led us to what we know now. Our children teach us about our parents.

The assumption is that evolution is a line. But evolution is in the context, in what we learn together, mutually. Strangely this was a central idea in my grandfather’s work. My father is given credit for the words “The evolution is in the context,” but he got them from his father, William.

Looping through eras, our intergenerational conversation is reflecting in what sometimes feels like an infinite mirror. The image defies family trees, it gets watery.

Together the generations, including those not here yet, have come to this point. Perhaps it is a midpoint, halfway through the human race. It is impossible to measure where the center is when the endpoint is infinite, so halfway is where we have always been. The point in time only matters when we ask, “how did we get here?” Which here?

Some elders teach children who not to become, how not to communicate, how not to live. Those influences are just as important as the ones who provide the inspiring contrast. Some children give their parents the incentive to live better. The day comes when most parents hear themselves say horrid things to their children and then think, “Did I actually say that?”

Survival of the fittest, in a world that worships development and ‘forward-moving progress,’ makes us all lost and small. Forgetting what we are part of, we cut it up into bite-size pieces and then place a range of values on the bits. Incredible. Imagine a jigsaw puzzle of the Grand Canyon, a thousand pieces spread out on a table, and ask, which are the most precious? Assess, discriminate, leverage, and then objectify…

…and exploit.

The future is as small or as lost as it is seen to be. It is the civil rights movement, and it is the ecology movement. It is the misuse of authority in the classroom, and the tyranny of endless economic growth. This story starts and ends drunk on half-assed justice and partial democracy. What world are we creating?

In the mirror, any man or woman might recognize the flickering beginnings of identity in a young girl just now realizing that she will be objectified by her culture. All of nature is that girl. She must begin to prepare herself… What kind of object shall I be? A precious object? A useful object? A dangerous object? A desirable object?

I do not want to be a broken object. But all objects are broken. Broken from their system, from the nest of relationships that form their evolving identities. This brokenness is contagious, and seeps out, breaking everybody.

This is the point where we stare off into space, the din fades into a timeline that never existed, and we can exhale into the pause knowing that there is no halfway.

Hope is in the other mirror. Reflecting upon another vision, the possibility boxes open.

See, we can see the looping flow across the timescapes; perceiving our present through rapid zoom-out, and simultaneous zoom-in. In a dizzying collapse of timelines something simple happens. A reveal is given frame. The minutiae take their place on something like a spiraled horizon.

The evolution will not be commodified. The value is intrinsic, and there is no zero-sum game. But there is implicit cost everywhere. Currency is in units of curiosity, empathy, unity, and sentiment.

Standing down from the need to claim my own ground I am reforesting the generations, as they are reforesting me.Daphne and Apollo

I would love you as a bird loves flight, as meat loves salt, as a dog loves chase,  
as water finds its own level.

Or I would not love you at all.

—Jeanette Winterson, Gut Symmetries

In the Galleria Borghese in Rome I wandered into a room with a Bernini statue that rewrote me.

Bernini’s ‘Daphne and Apollo’ is a heartbreakingly beautiful sculpture of an unflinching adoration. It is the depiction of an ancient but suddenly viable map back to the trees, through an eternity of yearning. In an impossible balance of weight-defying marble, Bernini has set even the wind against Daphne and Apollo’s final union. They are carved into a perfection of endless almost-ness…

I did not know the myth well enough to recall the storyline. Greek myths these days are wholly half forgotten, at least. The symbols remain, holding time’s revisions in erasable pencil. Who was Daphne again? What was her story? I remembered who Apollo was.

The statue questioned:

How do you wish to be loved?

And what of the earth?

We will never be out of relationship with the ecologies we live within, so what is the relationship?

For me, I would want conquest to be put aside. Unkind measurements of physical or financial worth should be simply abandoned. We are not here to win one another, nor to be won. Winning has a flawed polarity within it that suggests the possibility of defeat, and presumes the impossibility of being equals. Win a prize, or win a race: I am neither. Whatever the math is of our giving and receiving, it is not to be counted, or compared like taxes, nor contaminated with doubt and manipulation.

One of Apollo’s hands is wound around Daphne’s waist. The statue captures the last minute, when his fingers hover just above her navel, excruciatingly soft, holding her. She is beginning to transform into the laurel tree, Apollo’s touch returns her to her body. In the same moment she is bound to the forest. Bernini delicately sculpts this cold marble into the mythology of the potential of humanity’s engagement to the natural world in verse between beloveds.

We are water. We are air. We grow, we bloom, we seed, we wilt, we die. There is a false separation between humanity and nature. Of course we are nature. But, while the one-ness is enticing, unity is not so useful if it obscures our perception of the aesthetic of our relationship with the world around us. The paradox is good for us; it is medicine against the habit of binaries. We are nature, and we can also be besotted by nature.

Apollo was too late—Daphne’s fingertips had already become leaves. She would not belong to him. She joined the forest just in time. Bernini’s statue is a story of everything alive, and everything lost—a love story of the highest caliber. A signal, written in stone, to remind us always of the never-ending ways we are bound to nature itself.

Slipping from longing to greed is a tiny shift in aperture. The marble remains in the same form that Bernini left it, but the story that is read into it changes.

I entered the room in the Galleria where the statue is kept, and in a flash of recognition of another metaphor of what an impassioned closeness to nature might be, I realized I never wanted to hear the terms ‘resources,’ ‘stewardship,’ or ‘sustainable’ ever again. For all the good intentions those endeavors have on their side, they do not describe any relationship I would want to be in. In those words we see control, possession, objectification, and manipulation. Ache and tenderness are another approach altogether. The story of Daphne and Apollo is an old story, ready for new telling, and perhaps for the reclamation of an original imagining.

A good story has many meanings, and a surprising number of the old ones warn us of the dangers of hubris. Bernini’s retelling pushes past that old trope into the uncertain complexity of consequences that describe life.

Still, hubris is catalyst. Apollo, in a show of arrogance about his own hunting skills, chided Cupid for playing with arrows “like a child.” That was a mistake. Never mess with Cupid. Never chide love. It followed that Cupid set out to teach Apollo a lesson, which thousands of years later we are apparently still learning.

Prior to that day, the gnats buzzed in the fields alongside the swimming holes where Apollo and the lovely Daphne were flirting. She was doing her best to give him an opportunity to pursue her by not seeming overly interested. (But really, he was Apollo forgodsakes, how disinterested could she be?) And he was willing and eager to flatter her, showing off and boasting about his gloriousness. Delicate beginnings were in play; the filigree of invitation was being woven.

Cupid was small and mischievous, wise and difficult. He was not to be one-upped. He shot a golden arrow into Apollo’s heart. As it pierced Apollo a poison of desire was released into his blood, making him lovesick and obsessed with Daphne. Then Cupid shot Daphne in the heart with a leaden arrow, rendering her incapable of loving again. The evolution of their courtship was contaminated by two unecological corrosives; greed and cynicism. Daphne was unjustly written into Apollo’s punishment, you might think. But ask anyone, such is the nature of relationship. We carry each other’s pain. We learn together, or we do not learn.

Wedding rings should not be made of gold. Gold is a symbol for material desire, for ownership, and wealth, for hoarding and possessing. Gold is not lovable. It is the opposite of love. Gold is a stand-in for the sun, but the sun offers itself freely. Gold is money, collecting, stockpiling, claiming, Gold is counting beans with hunched and caved-in chest, it is hoarding the stockpile; it’s a shadowy corner.

Hearts are broken open, but in the time that has passed since the tale was told, this myth of Apollo and Daphne has been gathering dust. In this era, where importance is measured through property and position, the embarrassing breaking open of hearts is irrelevant and unnecessary. Gold won.

Longing is lost in having. It is an art to ache. It requires stoic strength and unshakeable trust matched by equivalent portions of impatience and naked vulnerability. Stretching into the delirious pull of just-out-of-reach love, lights every cell. Apollo is reaching with body and soul in an unresolvable tension. In doing so he engages wholly in the intense effortlessness of the living world. Daphne is alive without measure, without time. The poetry of creation is necessarily incomplete—always unobtainable. It is emerging, dying, defining boundaries, and breaking them, contracting and expanding in controlled chaos, or chaotic control. This is the uncrackable code of evolution.

Gratification is an intruder on this lust; it is a bucket of water on the smoldering coals that bring the laws of attraction to their boiling point. Lust and greed can be easily confused, but when it comes to love and ecology, they stand in dire opposition. Lust, with greenery wound around it in a festival of fecundity, is spirited with a desire of unions, while greed rots rank, desiring only to possess.

People used to write love-letters, and have long courtships with parlor visits. There was a practice of longing, and escapees dashed off to the gardens for a tryst here and there. Do we, can we, yearn in this way for that which we now refer to as ‘resources’?

Daphne’s blood was poisoned by Cupid’s lead. Perhaps in this postindustrial era we have all tasted that poison. The beginning of the end was always in the lead—and then the steel. The first use of the stuff was a cut to the umbilical cord. Cold and hard, immune to the viral bloom of love’s warmth, it sent grey alloy into Daphne’s veins.

The math of love is not good math. The sums have never added up. But we are built to adopt another equation, one in which the shameless vitality of life is given a parallax of its own. Even though fall comes, even though death exists, even though the nature of nature is to change, we set aside eternity for love. Until we are broken. Then we either soften or harden.

With lead in her heart, Daphne was greying inside. Doubt takes desire and mocks it, folding suspicion into attraction until it does a U-turn and becomes repulsion. He said he needed her. She could see now that his attraction to her was for all the wrong reasons, in all the wrong ways. Doubt makes a case for the fact that it is better to run away than toward. What is in the balance? A choice that is not really a choice. A decision made in the undergrowth and overtones. A vision of self in isolation cannot imagine the materials of mending. No healing is conceivable when the heart is faced with a wheel of whirling blades, insincere promises, fickle emotions, and obsessive flattery. So Daphne ran. Possession is not love; it is exploitation waiting to happen. There is nothing but an abyss of pain there. “He is covetous, not ready to love, and incapable of balancing what he is driven by,” she thought. His vision of ownership of her did not allow for either of them to have dignity. His version of her as his own, erased her history, her future, her complexity. So, “He is unsafe. Run, don’t walk.”

Apollo was hopeless. He knew better, but he could not stop himself. The golden arrow he was cursed by was too dazzling, and set alight a craving he could not tame, nor satisfy. He could not leave her alone, he wanted her, wanted her, wanted her. Wanted her for his own. Love? Of course he thought it was love, he was bedazzled. So lovely; bare feet skipping over the roots on the forest floor as she escaped his grasp, how could he not need her? Why could she not just settle her lovely self into his arms where she belonged? Pretty and fair, her limbs would have folded around his arms perfectly. Alone in the forest he found he had stopped chasing her and had his arms outstretched in an imaginary embrace which held nothing but air. Find her, make her his. Explain to her, tell her, convince her, win her, have her. Earn her. Catch her…

Apollo was the world’s original charisma maven. The primary golden boy. Actually, before the Cupid mishap, Daphne liked Apollo. What’s not to like? He made her laugh, he was beautiful and strong. He may have been a bit boastful, but then he had reason to be. She was warming to his affection, letting him in. She could assign him the familiar roles from her tales of love and marriage, giving him the male lead, the part of the lover. She daydreamed. He was highly daydream-able, and they were well suited. She never let on though. Of course not. That would spoil the fun, take away the chase. Now the chase was going to take her.

The lead had woken her up to the hypocrisy of jettisoning self-respect for adoration. Women do that. Maybe men do too. But for Daphne, now that she could see the pattern—never again.

That they were the playthings in Cupid’s mischievous chemistry experiment was not cloaked from them. Both of them understood mentally what was happening. Knowing does not matter. Once the arrows struck there was no way to reason with the runaway emotions and talk sense to them. It never matters with love, or greed, or addiction, or vengefulness, or envy. Understand all you want, the structures and the causations are totally irrelevant next to the dragons that lurk below what we think of as rational.

Cupid only triggered what was already there. He merely turned up the volume on the weaknesses of the heart that Apollo and Daphne each previously harbored. Everyone has a weakness: too stoic, too gushy, too beautiful, too strong, too dependent, too independent, too needy…. It could happen to any of us, at any second. The holes in our armor are the possibilities either for growth or destruction. We know this and, since the risk is horrid, we wear masks over masks to disguise ourselves. Cupid played the symphony that was already there. He just cranked it up to rock concert levels and sat back to enjoy the performance.

Daphne’s feet sought refuge in the contact they made with the forest floor. If they could just hold her up, keep her moving away from him. One eye seemed to make more tears than the other. Half despair. Half destiny. Half of history and she was only half the story. But the tears were coming fast. The heated weight of lead tearing against its own metallic nature made her fragile. The pulled and torn gauze veil of her heart was thin. Transparent, surely it could not withstand the touch of even his breath. She was betrayed by false armor. She wondered, “How can you be filled with lead and still be breaking?”

She turned her head backwards to see how far behind he was. Not very. He was a glow of gold and strength, a beam of determination, ambition, focused on her. Tree trunks seemed to lean out of his path. Unimpeded, he leapt the tangled shrubs, catching the sunlight like fuel. Stunning luck, he was as confident: a gambler with a no-lose bet, he rolled the dice of the irreverent wind to carry him forward.

Daphne was only getting heavier, sinking with sorrow, lost in loss, she began to realize she could not do this alone. But with the cynicism in her now she trusted no one. The metal in her blood oxidized every molecule of belief, as bacteria in a petri dish devour sugar. How could she even cry out? The plea in her voice would carry her delicacy to the outside world.

‘Resistant to corrosion’—that was what she was supposed to be, that was the point of lead, last-forever-lead. Lasting forever in cold isolation without a lingering string of connective warmth.

The grief was too much to drag behind her, in her, through her. She had done the math badly and would face the grade. Better to be something else. Perhaps she could be a door to another realm, she thought to herself: “If you cannot handle the connections, avoid the endpoints and be connectivity itself. Merge.”

To go into a bond, and form linkage with another, is to dangle in the ravaging sea. She could not hold her end of the thread, could not see it, it was not hers. Apollo’s beckonings across the forest were like ice shards stabbing at her bones. The idea of their merging was to her a disaster. It was a cliff to fall off, a non-existent bridge across an immeasurable crevasse for her to fall through. In self-protection her instinct was to reject instead of being rejected.

Her concern for him was minimal. Surely another damsel would catch his eye. Surely it was all a game to him. The alchemy of distrust and self-doubt scared all sweetness away. She ran now, alongside her empty-handed future. She offered no options, even to herself. There were to be no deals, and no way out. Nothing was too much.

With the momentum of a boulder on its way to the bottom-feeders of the Red Sea, she sank. A smooth plummet headed directly to the abyss. Was she standing still, screaming silently? She looked down. No, she was running, she was still running. Her leaded footsteps embossed her despair into the forest floor.

Cynicism, measurement, failure, rejection brought on by pounding poison. She could never have loved. She was emotional lead, melted to form but not to forge a bond. It was not written. Another nymph in another myth could maybe enjoy such mush. For Daphne, it would be better to transform into something that was already woven into the pattern. That way she could be un-partnered and still never be alone, like a tree in the forest.

“Change me,” she called to Peneus, “I cannot be. These limbs will carry only vulnerability, this womb will carry only the seeds of worthlessness, nothing will grow in me, nothing can absorb the nutrients of creation. I cannot be a vessel, let me out, change me… change me. If I cannot be creative, let me rest in the lap of creation, and be of some assistance there.”

The weight of cold lead seared and stripped her veins. She could not run further. Apollo was catching up.

The cold became cool, and the grey in her blood began to feel green. Fingertips first opening into leaves branching into stems. Her toes began rooting into the earth searching the moistness and gritty ground, finding bracing and balancing her against the winds. Her lungs filled for the last time with the breath that passed her lips. From this moment onward she would make oxygen, not inhale it. Her exhale was the flash of heat and the brush of ecstasy that trailed from where his fingertips whispered over her skin…

Apollo, was late. I wondered, as I stood in the corner of the Galleria, why are men always a second too late?

When their bodies touched, the antidote to Cupid’s poisons was scheduled to release them from the cursed arrows. Cupid knew better than to disrupt love. He was just a prankster. Apollo’s fingerprint on her belly sent affection flushing through Daphne’s veins with the scorching of a young woman whose body has just woken to love. But by then other influences were at work—her father’s magic was already in play; bark wrapped itself around her torso, leaves sprang from her hair, but her circulation was storming with the essence of her femininity met in full by Apollo’s love. Those were the last seconds of her life as a woman. Some still say she was one of the lucky ones.

Daphne reaches, marble arms like branches, lifting into the sunlight while I almost merge with her. Her tragedy and her triumph are tightly strung in the harmonizing chord so recklessly rung. This is life itself, it is love, it is yes & no, order & chaos. And it is ringing us all into existence. Invite life as it is—as much grace as disaster. There will be shredded emotional tissue and there will be the floating wisps of infatuated cloud dance. Or, without invitation, it’s just another statue; it’s nothing at all.

There in carved marble in the far western hall of the Galleria Borghese a study of who we are as ecologists is carved into our mythology. But which mythology? Whose version? I had the benefit of blurred vision, a half screwed up understanding of the piece. I read my own story. I know, with heavier stone now, the game of gold and lead and love and humanity and the earth. Longing now, to long again and to touch the belly of my natural nature. Is there a mythology that can release us from the grip of havingness? To adore the world around me as I would be adored, and never find the end of the strings that pull? I will remember Apollo in his reach for Daphne, and retell the story of the trees. Unsolved, unfinished.

And they lived stretched taught in desperate yearning ever after…

Phoebus (Apollo) admired and loved the graceful tree, (For still, though changed, her slender form remained) and with his right hand lingering on the trunk he felt her bosom throbbing in the bark. He clung to trunk and branch as though to twine.

—Ovid, Metamorphoses (A.D. Melville translation)Configuring

We long long long

To claim forever together.

Division into one

In obscure fractions of timelines

Laid out in love

My promise is measurement of how much of me I want to give you,

Drawn from the molten core that warms the soul

It adds up to an apex of surrender.

It’s the most precious alignment

A perfect solution

A spiraling symmetry

Promises have their own dimensions

Not broken by the x axis of time

They don’t wear out.

They are graced by unexpected evolutionary trajectories

But you might end up somewhere that you need to be

Enfolded with my promise

To a Somewhere this instant declares yours

A promise is an infinity in a moment

If you then me—

means stay.What’s the Opposite of Opposites?

Is it possible to blur the brackets a bit, perhaps feature the mushy infinitum of possibilities?

Seems like all these global negotiations at present are populated with far too many ‘this’s and ‘that’s and not enough ‘whatchamacallit’s. Niels Bohr said that “the opposite of a great truth is also true,” and that was good, but what about the not-quite-opposite-that-was-sorta-true-at-one-point-and-now-feels-suddenly-relevant… that is the one that needs another go around.

I would love to see the authenticity of a negotiation rhetoric that does not beget rigid binary positions, without a winner and a loser, something wider please….

![[p57-01.jpg]]Tears at the Bus Stop

Stories breathe life into the abstractions of philosophical pursuit.

The machine that seems to swallow up children at the age of 5 and spit them out again at 18 ready for the world (or at least ready for university), patterns deeply into the social system. Avoiding it, altering it, fighting it, and changing it are not easy mandates. But, surviving it intact is not easy either. The crisis we face now in education is not really about what is or is not provided in the curriculum; it is not about test scores, nor is it about which universities are the most prestigious. It is, in fact, not even about knowledge. The issue is more diffused. Simultaneously, it is more acute. Though nearly invisible to most eyes, the problem lies at the level of thought patterns. The prescribed mode of thinking that is generated by our educational systems is not conducive to the sort of thinking that new generations should have access to. It’s a matter of delivering an obsolete form of inquiry that fails to engage with the dynamics of living complexity. The stakes are high, the survival of the human species, as well countless others, is in question. And yet the lethargy around turning the Titanic of what we call school is apparent in every curriculum. The conversation about education that is needed starts with the relationship between the generations: a sacred territory between present, future, and past.

My memories of school are largely haunted by a sucking sound, a giant vacuum that pulled the oxygen out of the room, out of me, out of science, out of art, out of everything it could reach… leaving a lifeless shell of multiple choice, right and wrong answers, shame, and the small thrill of counting the minutes until lunch. Stories were relegated to fluff. The fractured, dominant paradigm ruled the school. I watched as an outsider, noticing that some people were good at pleasing what I later came to know as the ideological superstructure. Those students had learned the game, they could take in exactly the right bits of information and present them back to the establishment in keeping with the cultural savvy. Others would not be tamed; they fought, they ignored, they hid themselves in the folds of labels like ‘bad-boy,’ or ‘learning challenged,’ or ‘athlete.’ All too familiar is the bright child who after exhibiting original thinking in school and being chastised for it, has chosen not to try to succeed at the game. Many find that dignity can only be preserved if they don’t try to please the system—a skill they probably do not have. There is, in fact, a certain nobility in keeping some form of dented self-respect. These students are punished accordingly, not only with poor grades and distraught parent-teacher conferencing, but also by the shadow cast across their lives by the university they did not attend, the job they did not get, the wealth they will never have because they refused to drink the Kool-Aid when they were 14 years old. Most rebels are eventually broken.

I was somewhere in-between. Not willing to comply, not willing to fail. My education was marching me toward an indoctrinated, acclimated adulthood, but I was headed elsewhere. I had a secret weapon. I was lucky. Only now am I beginning to know how lucky. I had protection. I had the tears of my father.

My memory of those tears is vivid. In the mornings, my father would walk me to the bus stop and stand with me there until the yellow school bus came. At home he was not hesitant to be vocal about his suspicions of how I might be contaminated by the school system. On this particular day his gloom deepened as we waited for the bus together.

With a little British irony he joshed as he helped me climb aboard, “Use the brains you were born with.” As the school bus rolled away I could see from my seat out the window that my father was weeping. He would say to my mother, “They are going to ruin her mind.” But they never did.

For me, the contrast between home and school was extreme. To begin with, the dinner conversation protocol was premised on the notion that anyone, children included, was perfectly capable of making (and even expected to make) valuable contributions to the discussion. A sloppy thought was a sloppy thought, no matter the age or notoriety of its purveyor. All of us were of the understanding that the objective of our interactions was not to prove anything, or to be stroked for being knowledgeable in a particular subject, but rather to learn something, perhaps even stumble together into a new understanding.

What was a sloppy thought in this case? One that was riddled with the traps of split thinking, captured in the net of mechanistic logic. Our household was a place where breakfast was fried eggs and fresh thoughts, a piece of music was a starting place for a day’s inquiry, the Encyclopedia Britannica took up most of the table, and the fish tank was a source of poetic counterpoint to the Balinese art on the wall. The world for me was delivered un-separated. So, clearly, school was Hell. I could not make sense of it. The tasks and the language, the tests and the social structures were not within my realm of comprehension. They were asking the wrong questions.

Good questions do not have answers at all, let alone right or wrong ones. It is bad math. The world as it is, bubbling and swirling, unreasonable and uncertain, is a story fountain. The world as it was taught to me was starved of its harmony; it was a study in single notes. My father was writing a letter to a colleague when he wrote the phrase, “Break the pattern that connects and you necessarily destroy all unity.”

This became what is now a well-known quote from the introduction to his book, Mind and Nature:

“What is the pattern that connects the crab to the lobster, the orchid to the primrose, and all the four of them to you and you to me?” It’s a good question.

That question alone is grounds for an entire education. It calls for the formal details of living ecosystems to be seen in the larger context of pattern. It requires the differences to be described through specific study in order to examine the minutiae and the structures of living things, while simultaneously it pulls into focus a larger vision of the patterns and rhythms of life. How do the many details learn? How do they interact? How are they organized? Or rather, ‘how are they self-organizing?’ since the adjusting is incessant.

Research is process, and the study of process is the research. How does the context of our study shift when we imagine the stories of all living things? Can we begin to place our story inside that ever-unfolding epic of evolutionary development in nature? This is a question that interlaces empathy and the recognition of the patterns that we share with life itself.

The slightest recognition between ourselves and the sea creatures, between each other, between our family communication systems and the way a rainforest’s flora and fauna are interwoven is a peek into the possibility that we share a story. It’s a gateway to another kind of ethics that carefully tends to the aesthetic. This was why my father cried. He was mourning the loss of that precious capacity to integrate and function within the uncertainty of interdependency. What my father did not know was that the tears he cried for me formed a shield. Those tears carried a meta message that took up residence below my conscious understanding. In the clarity there was something important that could be lost. My mind was in danger, and I knew that I should not trust the institutional authority I would spend the next decades in communion with. I cannot say that his shield made it easier for me; in fact, it kept me alert to the need to stretch across a paradox—to ride on a pair of mustangs, one foot on the hypocrisy of the education system and the other on the pursuit of wisdom.

I am not sure exactly how to alter the educational system to incorporate a study of the overlapping patterns in life. Education is, of course, part of a larger context of culture, including economy, language, politics, science, and so on. We are normalized into an unworkable imbalance, forever tearing the world into pieces and reifying the need to grasp each answer, each ‘solution,’ and freeze it. This is wildly out of keeping with the dance of life, as Heraclitus reminds us with his observation that “you cannot step into the same river twice.” Never rest in certainty.

The ambiguity we need is unacceptable to the requirements of notions such as ‘authority,’ ‘credibility,’ and ‘expertise.’ A politician cannot build a campaign on the premise of acknowledging that the problems the country faces right now are so big that it is not possible to actually ‘know’ how to fix them. Likewise, a teacher can hardly begin a class by recognizing their lack of knowledge on the subject being taught. As a parent, I have found that the best we can do is model for our children a kind of communication that is open, vulnerable, and learning… but also we have to teach them that this relationship is not to be taken for granted. Kids have to know that most adults will expect them to be respectful without any inclination to reciprocate that respect. Adults often abuse their authority by presuming their right to be right, and believe they should not be questioned, doubted or proven wrong under any circumstances. It is unfortunate to have to teach children to feign respect. But they have to know how to deal with their world. Their touchstone will be the adults who were willing to learn.

The education system that reaches around the globe is a mess. My father was not so far off when he suggested that young minds were being ruined by it. The violence of breaking the world into bits and never putting it back together again substantiates the kind of blindness in which we have separated ecology from economy, and psychology from politics.

What is the restorative? Is there a prototype or a structure for another concept of education? Can we fix this? From my perspective I see that the coming generations will be faced with a translation task. They will carry two narratives simultaneously that are seemingly at odds. One is the story of a world that is broken and binary. The other is the wider focus of a world of stories, woven and tangled in ever-changing response to one another. Somehow these coming generations will tightrope through the transactions that fill their days.

In our relationships between generations we will move through this misalignment with nature, to another sort of interaction—together. The weight of authority that exists now, allocated unequally between age groups and levels of expertise is setting a discordant toxicity loose into our way of living, our way of learning, our way of seeing, our way of knowing.

There is much that we cannot teach these coming generations. They need skills we do not have to offer—advice we cannot give. They need elders they will not find. They need elders who have met the source of the earth but also know the coda of the Wall Street machine. They need a sci-fi grandmother—wise with humanity and rich with intuition, but a warrior of the digital, and adept in urban professionalism. They need elders who are willing and able to think in new ways, and admit when they are wrong.

Since we cannot supply this for them, our secondary task is simply to get out of the way. Our job is to weep at the bus stop. We will have to find the strength to carry the heaviest of all burdens—an empty bag of tricks. We have to allow this generation to make mistakes we could not afford to make, to let them play with the edges of our frames while we leave a trail for them, with baskets of the most magnificent examples of humanity we can find. Reasons, great art, incredible mathematics, beautiful science, heartbreaking poetry, tales of history’s turning points, all told from multiple perspectives.

There is no ‘why’ to ask.

We are why. ‘We’ includes inclusiveness,

We are crooked trees, in our forests

While ‘why’ presumes there is an answer,

Erasing necessary ambiguity.

When the arrow becomes liquid,

And slender directness smears,

The target widens,

And the goal is edgeless.

Non-responses and no-reasons,

Authorize composting interactions,

Alive and learning with happy worms,

Down where history is cultivating future.

Come with questions that span eras,

Where sharp details are dethroned,

Blurred until eyes intent, lose track,

And the knowing moves again.

When calamity is drenched through,

And piercing purpose is saturated,

The soggy mess is muddied.

Strange clarity spores into the undergrowth.

Acute situations require action,

Based in swift clear decision,

Made in the muck and dripping with it,

What will be—pulling into place.

Below, in the squish of life,

There is no replacement part,

Nothing to solve.

But we can breathe in the mess.Zombies and the Hitchhiker

or

Context Produces Possibility

I have two stories to share here, seemingly unrelated at first glance; they form their own duet. Together they illustrate almost everything I hold true. They are theory in action; they are what happens when there is another way of looking at the world that allows for the back-swirl of contingencies to be authorized. When the script we have hard-wired inside us is upended in favor of a wider affection for life, something else happens. The context produces possibility. Unforeseen options emerge. It takes courage to meet the hard moments in this spirit. I know I am mostly misunderstood in my attempts at making a direct case for this approach. Stories help. I offer you zombies and the hitchhiker.

Dignity Vanquishes Zombies

For me, this story is about mutual learning between generations; it is also about how to make change in a stuck system. It is about the blinders of western culture. It is about how acute situations make complexity difficult to advocate for. This story is about the disaster of the education system, and a young man trying to survive it. This story is about my love for that young man (my own son), and the unexpected treasure we found together, which helped get him through the maze of hypocrisy that middle school epitomizes. This is a story about zombies, actors, and the openings to realms of communication between parents and children that are often missed. There are paths through our culture that have been worn in so completely that it is nearly impossible to see past the prescribed, pre-scripted versions of how to navigate them. This is one example where we, my son and I, found a trapdoor that led to a systemic shift for both of us. My son Trevor has given me permission to put it in this book; it’s our story, and this is my version of it.

Trevor was about 12 years old. On a typical suburban evening, in our atypical home, we were unloading the dishwasher. With a sly eye he removed the food-processor blade, showed it to me and said, “Mom, if there is ever a zombie invasion, you could, like, totally use this.”

What? Trevor is a funny guy, and I was amused by this fantastical observation. I did notice though that Trevor had been talking about zombies quite a bit that autumn. At that time teenagers were just finishing a trendy vampire craze. I assumed that perhaps zombies were the next fixation. Trevor’s comments were not yet registering as particularly relevant. We carried on without notice of the zombies.

Meanwhile, emails from school started coming in. In this era, in contrast to the one I grew up in, parents receive emails whenever there is an issue at school. I suppose the practice is well intentioned, but receiving those emails is irritating. My parents never got emails. But I sure did. Emails from teachers, counselors, and administrators began to pop into my inbox. They each arrived with a tone of both blame and concern. “Trevor is being disruptive.” “Trevor is being disrespectful.” “Trevor is not listening.” “Trevor is horsing around in class and causing distraction.” And then, after a few weeks, “We would like to meet with you about Trevor’s behavior.” “Trevor will be scheduled to see a school counselor.” “The principal would like to discuss a plan for what do to about Trevor’s behavior with you and Trevor’s teachers.” “Have you considered that Trevor may have ADHD, and may require medication?” And so on.

The underlying message I was being given through these emails was that my kid needed more discipline, and that if discipline was not ‘effective,’ perhaps it would be necessary to consider medication. While I cannot speak for other parents and their children, I knew in my bones that neither discipline nor medication were going to be ‘effective’ remedies in Trevor’s case. Something was going on with him, and I had no idea what. I also had no idea how to deal with it. I knew there had to be another layer of information that I was not seeing. And, more importantly, my boy was dimming down his effervescence.

For several more weeks this continued. Trevor had to go to detention, and he began to wear the reputation of a ‘bad-boy’ at school. He even began to believe he was a ‘bad-boy.’ The subtle and not-so-subtle body language of his teachers underscored their view of him and in time Trevor was willing to identify himself as they did. He carried this new identity heavily. Both physically and emotionally I could see the change in him. His focus was on the floor; his ire was on a hair-trigger. He had always been a beaming bright boy who had gradually become cloudy over the course of only a few months. It is hard not to panic seeing a child carry such shadows. Of course I wanted to do everything I could to help him.

As a parent there were paths before me that I was expected to follow. The school had identified Trevor as a behavior project, and had suggested what they considered to be ‘normal’ procedures to deal with such students. Ahead of us lay the paths of counseling, increasing discipline at home, and possible diagnosis and/or treatment for attention disorders. These are the options. But, are they the only options?

Meanwhile, Trevor kept talking about zombies. Not in a gruesome way, but in jest, and in his metaphors. Guys his age often say things that are vivid with the _resources/books//Small Arcs of Larger Circles_ Framing Thro - Nora Bateson of their fantasy world. I thought nothing of it. Until, finally one night Trevor came into my room at four in the morning in tears; he had had a nightmare. It was still dark, I was very asleep, and for some unknown reason in my half-awake state I accidently produced what was perhaps my best possible moment of parenting. I cannot claim that I had a plan, or a doctrine that I was abiding by. I was just sleepy.

I asked Trevor what the nightmare was about. He said, “Zombies.”

The great teleprompter of our culture that delivers the script for mommies says that at that moment the appropriate line is: “Don’t worry honey, there is no such thing as Zombies. I am here, everything is ok.” The programming to deliver these lines is strong.

But I did not say any of those things. Instead I took his hand, gave it a kiss and told him we would talk about it in the morning.

Why did I do that? To this day I do not know. I can only say that something gave me pause. The simple platitude of reassurance felt disrespectful to Trevor’s struggle. I did not know what to say or do, so I postponed the conversation until morning.

As a mom, I find that setting my internal alarms to go off when these pre-scripted moments surface is a good idea. In my experience these are precious opportunities for substantive evolutionary communication change between the generations. The way in which culture directs our parenting is almost invisible, and profoundly pernicious. Cultural scripts are tricky, they sneak up on you. Suddenly I notice that I have said one of those things that parents say, “Clean up your room—I don’t know how you live like this.” Or “Don’t talk to me with that tone of voice.” I like to tag those tiny micro moments and expand them. I usually find there is something more there, and that had I gone along with the script I would have set another course of interaction into play. Avoid parental autopilot, that is my motto.

I woke the next day wondering what sort of zombies were haunting my kid. My zombies are inane; they’re the ones from the Michael Jackson ‘Thriller’ music video: gory and groovy. Or, sometimes my zombies are like the ones from ‘The Night of the Living Dead’ which attack and eat people’s brains. They are impressive in their costumes and spooky music, but do not shake life’s foundations.

I know my son, and neither of those types of zombies would frighten him in the way that he was clearly frightened when he came to my room that night. He was scared—deep down.

I became curious to find out more about his zombies. The next morning I asked, “Trevor what is a zombie for you, because I have a feeling that the zombies in your head are not the same as the ones in my head?”

I will never forget his answer. Trevor at age 12 said:

“Zombies are people who cannot think for themselves, they want you to be like them. …And, if you do what they say, your dignity flies out the window.”

I have never heard a more succinct description of the cultural stranglehold of western civilization. In that moment I realized with tears in my eyes that there were thousands of Trevors out there derailing classroom activities with disrespect, disruption, not listening, and—in their own way—they were fighting the zombies. These kids are engaged in perhaps the noblest battle there is: the battle to protect one’s dignity. They are willing to risk everything for this cause. They get in trouble, they lose privileges, they are labeled ‘bad-boys’ and ‘bad-girls,’ they spend hours with counselors, they are given medication, they sabotage their college entry, they even lose the proud love of their parents. But, they will not submit to the zombies. I have to respect that.

“Yes,” I said to Trevor, “We live in a full tilt zombie invasion. I live in it too. I struggle every day. What shall we do?”

I went on to explain that his teachers meant no harm. No one meant any real disrespect, but to keep the class organized and on task they felt they had to control the kids. Trevor was not accustomed to being controlled.

In truth when Trevor delivered his description of his zombies I knew immediately that he was going to be fine. He had touched upon one of the great challenges that anyone inclined toward critical thinking slams into. He was asking the right question. He was taking the right risk. I knew I did not have to worry about Trevor losing himself. But, I still needed to help him get through the 5th grade without burning his future bridges to university and a successful life. Honestly, being a parent is a demanding job.

Trevor and I were now off script. The counselors and the diagnoses were no longer on the table as remotely relevant. Now an entirely unwritten conversation lay in front of us. Clearly he needed to do something to reclaim his dignity. Changing schools was one option. But there were sure to be zombies at the next school too. So it was my turn; I took a risk and made a deal with Trevor.

Trevor is an actor, and he was already studying performance at that time. So I offered him his first paid acting job. I promised him 100 dollars to play the part of the Straight-A student until the end of the school year, (it was already February). If he could play that part the zombies would be fooled into thinking that they could stop trying to control him. Hopefully he would have some peace. But, I had one caveat; that he never, ever, ever believe that he actually was that Straight-A student the world wanted him to be. I said, “Play the part, but I want my Trevor for a son, not a zombie.”

I wanted him to know that he had an advocate. It was important to me for him to see that there are times in life when we do not have a prefabricated answer or solution. And that I would be there to experiment with him until we found a way through, together. I wanted him to know that even parents do not know how to deal with people trying to control them. Besides that, I only wanted him to know that his fear was real and beautifully articulated.

The school administrators would never have discovered that particular medicine for my son. I do not blame them. But I do want to shatter the accepted normalcy of their response. To ‘fix’ a child’s expression of anger or fear is a horrible thing to do. They are not broken; they are navigating cultural, physical, emotional, and intellectual terrains that are overpopulated with false authority and hypocrisy. We adults are tour guides of these realms, bestowed with the highest possible trust by the coming generations. Let them see us learn. Complexity is surprising, multi-causal, ruled by overtones, and not systemize-able. The only tactics I can advise are respectful patience, affection, and playfulness.

For his 17th birthday I had his iPod engraved with the words: “Dignity Vanquishes Zombies.”

Trevor is a good actor, and a very good student. At university he made the dean’s list several times. He wrote to tell me: “I made a 3.9 grade point average this term, but don’t worry Mom, I am not a zombie.”

Representation is something to be careful with. Mutual respect requires careful jurisdiction on the habit of portraying another person’s experience. I do not lightly offer this story.

After reading my version Trevor added a couple of paragraphs:

I can recall a time in my life when no matter what I did, I felt as though I had to appeal to an authority outside of my own. Whether that was teachers, parents, peers, or even just the preset social standards did not matter. Failing to please meant some form of punishment. I knew then that educational institutions have no vigor for those of us who question them. Can they not see that emails home, alienation, and categorization are not solutions to ‘behavioral issues’ but rather triggers that drive small boys to draw penises on desks? If you put a twelve-year-old student under constant surveillance, and write home about his progress or lack thereof, do you think he will feel at peace? Or alienated? If the schools suggest medication and control tactics they presume that will improve the students’ relationship with school. Will it? No. For those of us who see the zombie world it will just hasten the realization that the educational system is a front for a large-scale colonization project, ridding us of our right to personal perspective.

Yes, I am Trevor, and to this day I can see the zombies, walk with the zombies, talk with the zombies, but I know in my bones that I believe none of it. My mother, a very gracious, nurturing, and unorthodox mother, taught me everything I know. She helped me access my potential, and never gave me a fabricated answer. When I went to my mom that night in tears, having just dreamed of a classroom in which everyone was just mindlessly performing their tasks, no individuality, no talking, no freedom, I thought “Oh no, my mom’s going to just tell me to go back to bed and that it’s nothing.” But, of course, my mom is a Bateson, so she said, “Let’s talk about this in the morning.” We eventually understood that both our lives are filled with conformity, but our minds have to remain free. My mother implored me to find my way to find peace in both, by giving me my first job, in which I would get a real introduction to the process of living in two worlds at the same time. One where authority is defined as mutual respect, and the other where it is merely deference. The latter just requires a smile, a nod, and an answer, but never, ever an opinion.

Hitchhiker Emergency

Someone asked me once if I had ever seen my father in an emergency, and if I might describe how he dealt with it. At the time I replied that I had never witnessed him in any danger, or in an emergency. Later I remembered that I had. The fact of my not recalling the emergency is significant.

We were driving to my riding lesson. We lived in Big Sur, California. If you have ever had the pleasure or terror of driving the Big Sur coastline on Highway One, you will know that the two-lane road has majestic mountains on one side and death-defying cliffs that plummet down to the Pacific Ocean on the other. We had an old dirty white Volkswagen Van. It was the ’70s, we were a hippy family and I was a long-legged, scraggly, mountain child, about 10 years old. I was in the backseat, free to roam around as there were no seat belts back then. My father was driving, and while it is not part of this story let me just say he was one of the worst drivers ever. He was always busy looking at the whales, or spotting hawks. Terrible.

As we drove up the coast, we passed a hitchhiker on the side of the road who had his thumb out. He was a young man with a big backpack. A traveler. My father, ever the anthropologist, was interested in travelers, and in people in general. He liked to pick up hitchhikers. He liked to have conversations with strangers. So we picked up this fellow.

A few minutes later as we were driving along the man suddenly had a knife in my father’s side. He was demanding money; he was pumping with adrenaline. I think this qualifies as an emergency. A two-lane road with nowhere to pull over. A kid in the back seat, and it would be another 30 years before the invention of the mobile telephone.

But I never noticed. I did not see the emergency because my father’s response was to cheerfully look down at the knife, then into the man’s eyes and say in his most droll Englishness, “Well hello, what have we here?”

He was authentically calm and amused. His interest in the desperate young man had actually increased several fold by this communication, (i.e. a knife and monetary demands). My father began to ask him questions. How had he come to be in Big Sur? How had he found himself in such a muddle? Through these questions and, more importantly, the tone of the questions, my father was listening and learning about how someone can get in such a twist. He was not applying a psychological trick or a technique. This was not a manipulation. He was not ‘trying’ to calm the guy down. He was just interested, one human being to another. His curiosity in the young man was piqued, and his inquiry reflected that. He did not see a knife… he saw a person with a story.

How would most people react? Would they fight, would they try to get the money to him right away? Would they try to trick him? What are the scenarios that immediately play out? For most of us, a knife in our side would be a moment of panic. This was an emergency. But somehow it was not. As a passenger in the back seat of the van I watched their interaction and never for one second felt fear in the car. There was no spike in the drama, no flutter of breath, no indication of danger at all. I still do not think of that afternoon as being life-threatening, though surely it was.

After driving another half an hour we came to a place where we would have to drop off our hitchhiker and deliver me to my horseback-riding lesson. When we pulled off the road my father opened his wallet and gave the young man a $20 bill. He wrote our home phone number on a scrap piece of paper from the floor of the car and gave the guy a hug. My father suggested that the man call if he found himself in trouble. These were not idle generosities to suggest good will. He was not faking it. The warmth and the care he felt for the traveler was genuine. I could feel that, and so, apparently, could the hitchhiker. All three of us learned a great deal from that half an hour in the VW van.

As I look back now at that situation I can only say that I hope one day to be able to see context as well as my father did. He was not young when this story took place. He was maybe 74 years along in his practice of seeing more than just the tip of the knife. I suppose it takes time to be able to respond to an acute situation with love that stems from complexity… or is it the other way around: complexity that stems from love?

Perhaps there is no beginning to that loop. I will start by noticing my reactions, and searching for wider, deeper edges to the complexity I am reacting to, responding to—and shift that into mutual learning.

The solution expected, the way predicted, is so far removed from the options that surface when viewed from a wider angle, that they are entirely unplannable. I have spent long hours defending the possibility that attempting to solve a problem by going at it directly is only occasionally effective. I usually receive lost looks of bewilderment and a plea for a map, a method, and a technique. But, so often we make more of a mess than we ever imagined possible by seeking direct solutions. The problems we see are nested in contexts with particular alchemies that produce the ‘issue’ we want to solve. Identifying and strategizing our way through becomes short-circuiting which is often destructive. The consequences go spiraling off into further confusion, more issues, and more problems. Sometimes the way through is at an entirely unseen angle.The Thing Is…

Time rolled us around like river rocks

Wore the edges round.

Soft enough to hold now, without breaking the skin

Like stepping barefoot through sun-warmed prairies

Your touch telling mine a story

It illustrates in epiphanies.

Quick movement and the slippery stones slide back into the water,

Where intuition swims below the line of logic.

There, the water is slow and ancient

Whispering breathy prophecies—just out of range,

Mouthing directions through wobbly waves.

Not quite see-able, easily misheard.

Which way? What did you say?

We are mapping ourselves in illegible script.

In the pleasure, the play, the lightness

Weightlessly draped together, I am barely holding you

It just is.

Jasmine instinctively bends into the spot the shadow does not reach.

Holograms of glass shards have been projected onto our path,

Are placed there to remind us to tread carefully.

The river knows its course.Transcontextuality

I am giving up on interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and even meta-disciplinarity. The world is not made of disciplines. I still hold the work of my academic colleagues in high esteem, but I no longer place the academy at the center of the solar system of knowledge. I now see the academic contribution to learning as one aspect of knowledge—amongst many. Life is not divisible into the departments of a university, nor is our understanding of life greatly increased by standard research practices, which tend to pull their ‘subject’ matter out of the larger contexts they exist in, to facilitate focused study. The studied subjects never get put back into their relationships, and the contexts never seem to be describable in the data.

There was a time when I would have said that the context is what is missing in our current research practices. I might have said that we have a methodology in academic and scientific research that allows for an imbalanced attention to ‘things,’ rather than their contextual relationships. But I have come realize that even context is not enough. Living systems especially require more than one context of study if we’re to get a grasp of their vitality.

Transcontextual description as a starting place opens the possibilities of better understanding the interdependency that characterizes living (and arguably many non-living) systems. With a transcontextual lens I find interfaces of mutual learning. This lens opens up entirely new dimensions of information where the data has otherwise been flattened into a single plane or a single context. I also find that the multiplicity of the descriptive process demands that I never lose sight of the many perspectives that are integrating. There is no lack of rigor in this research. It is not to be done alone; a multi-headed research group is needed.

If we look at a medical or educational institution, for example, and begin to describe it in terms of it transcontextuality, we will see that both exist in contexts of family wellbeing; both exist within the context of societal robustness; the economics of both medicine and education share contextual languages of research from public and private funding; both are contextually bound to their respective history and to the development of their field; and both exist within contexts that share cultural understanding of authority. These shared contexts will provide us with linkings to wider descriptions of these institutions. The contextual descriptions observed offer new perspectives on how the interdependency is interweaving between them.

The transcontextual lens also demands the zoom-in. The contextual interfaces shared by a family might include cultural trends like technology and music, school culture, the historical perspective of their parents, a context of social expectation within their demographic of friends and family, as well as the children’s personal contextual perspectives, their health, their hygene, their talents, and their history within the family. The parents will have other contexts, such as their professional lives, their own experience as children, their financial position, their cultural context in time, their home food culture, their relationship with each other. And, again, each parent will have their own contextual frames, including their physical health, their friendships, their history, their language, their relationship to nature, and so on.

All of these contexts, shared and otherwise, come together to form the ‘causalities’ of the family. They integrate into the aesthetic of the family communication culture. Each context is a door into the many informing processes that culminate in the ongoing interdependency of family. (I have only named a few contexts to make a point; in any family there will be more, and perhaps more important, contexts—ones that I have not mentioned.)

In interaction with a complex system, like an institution, or a family or a forest, familiarity with the transcontextual interdependency requires humility and in return offers insight.

A forest is a world of insects, of microbacteria, of flora, and fauna, with weather patterns, and interactions with human contexts of industry or conservation. The forest is not fragmenting these contextual processes, but is them. An understanding of the interaction between these contexts is an understanding of the forest itself.

A transcontextuality lens offers productive observational advantages over the singular contextual model, and certainly over the disciplinary model. But what about being alive? Isn’t that by definition a transcontextual process? And, if the transcontextualiy is mutually informing and forming, where is agency in transcontextual causality? This is a question that I am puzzling with. Through the construct of seeing the world as ‘things’ it is possible to separate the livingness of life forms that share contexts. In that separation, agency is assignable. But, when the larger intertwined contexts are in focus, agency is diffused. The influences they share are not separable. The vitality is inclusive in the contextual relations.

I am hoping for an increasing familiarity with this vocabulary and a mandate for this kind of information and “warm data”—data within its many contextual relationships. Without it there are blind spots, denials, numbnesses that hinder the development of sensitivity to so much information. Without this information, mistakes get made, simplifications abound, and a bland flatness encompasses our inquiry. With a transcontextual approach the inquiry is still not easy, but it’s enriched with perspective and diverse knowledge. There is toxicity in the flat numbness of singular study; the blending of contexts is where the study becomes alive.

![[p75-01.jpg]]Leadership Within the Paradox of Agency

In this era of multiple crises and global threats, I am increasingly uneasy with the call for leadership. Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Rachel Carson, and other iconic figures are held up as examples of true leaders: they offered charisma, vision and strength enough to pioneer new eras of thought. The lack of such characters now, we are told, suggests a vacuum in our capacity to generate the old-school kind of hope for the future that these courageous individuals embodied. So where are the leaders of today? This is the question plaintively asked of today’s activists, scientists, politicians, and keepers of the moral fabric.

I would like a moment to call bullshit. This thinking about leadership is not useful. There is no such thing as an isolated individual—we are all interdependent. Period. Our evolution is only in our mutual contribution and learning. Mutual. Leadership is an evolving process and, as such, our understanding of what leadership is must evolve in accordance. In the past the world understood leadership as the great deeds of heroes; now we are in another phase of global transition that requires an understanding of leadership based on our understanding of interdependency.

Is there a part of any of us that we can point to and truly say, “that is me—untouched or influenced by any of my history, my culture, education, family, religion, social life…”? Unlikely. Perhaps, instead, leadership is a product of the context, combined with other influences that seem to culminate in crowning an individual with leadership duties. When we look through the lens of interdependency, it is impossible to separate individuals from their contexts of influence and experience. This blurs the ‘hero’s story.’ Leadership, then, can better be attributed to the town or village that nourished a person than to that person’s individual qualities.

In ecological terms we can attribute the health and vitality of the whale to the ocean not only to the whale, and we can attribute the strength of the lion to the jungle (or savannah) not only to the lion. The environment in which the alchemy of collective need is met with a corresponding alchemical combination of possibility produces new paths to follow. In the combination of community and individual, hardship and support, isolation and belonging, past and future, vision and discipline, there can arise a perfect storm that produces what we have, in the past, called leaders.

The very word ‘leadership’ has become cringe worthy. It reeks of colonialism and lopsided history-book listings of individuals successful in taking, making, and claiming. Celebrating the potency of the individual is an insatiable ghost haunting the endless array of courses and manuals for developing leaders. Our fatal flaw may be the idea that an individual or institution can single-handedly penetrate new frontiers of possibility. This is an obsolete but undead dream of heroes and rescuers pioneering innovations. Lightning bolts of imagination and strength, these so-called leaders are presented as utterly independent of their histories; as though they had fallen from the sky. The haunting seeps into what we call ambition, fueled by our wanting to be important and successful. There are scissors somewhere that slice the ambitious from their comprehension of the mutuality we all inevitably live within. The mutuality is where the imagination is brewing, where the strength is made, where the integrity of the context lies. Can we extract a stand-out entity from that mutuality and call it a break-away? Isn’t the break-away a product of the mutuality? How can ‘leaders’ exist without all the relationships that have culminated and fermented to make them? Should we not point to those mutualities as heroic?

So I don’t want a leader. I am sick of heroes. I look back at how we got where we are now and I wonder what kind of systemic imbalances have been created by the thinking that longs to canonize leaders. What is a leader in a complex system anyway? What is the ecology of leadership?

I think there isn’t one. When we look to nature for models, we find that there is not an ecology that would accommodate the existing model of leadership. Think of trees in a forest. How did the ‘leaders’ get so tall? Were they extra courageous or charismatic? The ecological response would observe that the other organisms mutually contributed to that growth. The ‘king of the jungle’ is human nonsense that understands nothing of the lion’s relationships in the ever-changing natural order of the many species that extend into the pride of lions. The alpha dog is seen as the ‘leader of the pack,’ presuming that the pack ends with the grouping of dogs, which it does not. The human construct of leadership is projected onto the pack by us who are in the habit of identifying that pattern. Dogs have no such framing. Pack members are in communication and mutual learning with each other and the wider surroundings, responding to information that is funneled through the ‘alpha’ but generated through the pack. This makes the ‘relationship of dominance’ perceived, contextual, and not fixed. What we see as deference is a collaborative, communicational relationship that can be disrupted if the ‘leader’ or the ‘followers’ reorganize the communication.

In fact, I think our notions of leadership are toxic to the ecology of communication and collaboration in a social system. How can there be real communication when there is deference to a leader? This imbalance creates a hold-back of contribution and interaction. Look now at the fascination with celebrity that has infected the globe. The imbalance in the possibility for communication when one individual is placed above others in this way effectively destroys the possibility of true cooperation and mutual learning.

Mutual learning is only possible when all participants are willing to be wrong… willing to learn, to explore new ideas, to go off the map, out of the known, and together grope in the shadowy corners of new ideas, new plans, new territories. That cannot happen if one person is the know-it-all. Even if that person has perfect ‘leadership skills’—they still disrupt the ecology with individualism. ‘Leadership’ often creates competition, ambition, greed and, on the flip side, fosters deference, hopelessness, apathy, and blame.

Being part of a system requires knowing that whatever happens is an expression of the patterns that entire system is involved in—that means, there is no fault, and everyone is responsible. No blame. Everyone must contribute to the shift. The health and the toxicity of the system ecologically manifests in keeping with the trends of the system. Someone with a diet of sugar, alcohol, pesticides and other harmful substances may develop pimples, rashes, tumors, or other illnesses. The manifestations of the system’s toxicity are intrinsic responses—indicators of challenges to the system. In the same way the toxicity of our institutional infrastructure is an indicator of the challenges in our cultural zeitgeist. The tumor or pimple is formed from within the body as a whole, in the same way that the healing of a wound, or embryonic development of a baby is also formed from within the system as a whole, including the father. These forms are not stand-alone.

This means big oil is not to blame, big banks are not to blame, big pharma is not to blame. Big weapons, and bad guys—not to blame. We are all included in a pattern in which those systems are interlocked into our survival and destruction. Whether we like it or not. As uncomfortable as it is, the lens of contextualizing leadership reveals that the responsibility we would like to hold our institutions to, does not in fact lie inside the institutions, but between them. The linkings between institutions, where no governing body lies, is the zone where integrity or corruption actually rests. But there is nothing there; no board of directors, no policy, no bylaws; it is a nowhereland where there is neither authority nor jurisdiction. The injustices that occur are not stand-alone either, they are the tumors, the pimples, and the deadly contextual toxicity in our culture.

One example is the interlocked institutional bond that forms the spectrum of troubles around depression and anxiety. It is all too easy to get bogged down in the current cultural quest for success and to feel unable to measure up. The anxiety and depression of this feeling of failing is often treated with pharmaceuticals that have side-effects, including addiction, further depression, or conditions that need additional medication. The pain of this common story leaks into marriages, family life, professional productivity, bleeding into how the affected family interacts with the education system, and even the legal system. Where is the responsibility? Pointing a finger anywhere in particular is only a small peek of inquiry into the situation. Should big pharma not sell those drugs? Should society not be so competitive? Should government take better care of citizens?

An institution is made of people, each with their own biographies, and it exists within community, culture and, ultimately, the natural world. Margaret Mead noted the African proverb, “It takes a village to raise a child.” Indeed, the responsibility for the world the child grows to understand lies in the collective impressions that the village provides. In the same way, the behavior of institutions lies in the contextual expectations and valuations of each organization’s relationships within the larger community, as well as at the level of each employee. This is a tricky set of boundaries to draw, influenced at meta levels by lurking habits of thinking that tend to individuate. The responsibility is in the village, and the way the village interacts with its institutions. In the same way, the institutions interact with each other to form the linking zone where the blending of culture, economy and education happens. In our dissatisfaction with the behavior of our institutional or corporate organizations, we, the village, with our wish for ‘change,’ may feel impotent. Politics, business, law, education, medicine, and media are all substantiating each other. Politics needs business to thrive, education is the link to employment and scientific importance, medicine and law try to support both the political and personal codes of health and justice in respect to business and governmental policy. We cannot after all vote on the board or rewrite corporate policy from the sidelines. We cannot impose transformation on the institutions. But we can change our relationship to them. In doing so we alter relationships between institutions. Collectively, growing systemic transformation is always relational; the ecology is what changes, not the individual bits.

We may learn more about leadership if we study it as an entrustment of context, and not as a twinkle bestowed upon a few select individuals from the heavens above. To trust the context requires a second order shift in purposing our agendas. Instead of being activists for this or that cause, we need to tend to the contextual capacity for those changes we would like to see. For example, making laws that limit the production and distribution of dangerous drugs does not stop the drugs from being made and sold. Those who see gain in supplying them find a way, either legally or illegally. But if there is a shift in shared tastes and values within the community—a general trend that does not include those drugs—the suppliers will seek other opportunities. So the question is not how to stop the dealers, though this clearly must be addressed to some extent. The more effective inquiry is around how to assist the community overall in valuing its own well-being. The context, be it a society or family or ecology of any sort, will adjust in the ways in which its given circumstances accommodate. The illusion of the leader’s capacity to innovate is created by the success of the one who chimes the bells that were in a sense ready to ring anyway.

We might inquire more broadly (while at the same time trying to change policy)—what kind of civilization we want to live in. What kind of family is this? What sort of person am I? Am I the sort that is numb to the suffering of others? That question is not about which street beggars I may or may not give a coin to, it is about what my children see me do, all day every day and how they make sense of the world they are growing up in. The millions of people who are forced now for economic, ecological, and political reasons to start new lives in new lands, are dangerous not because they will deplete the social services of the ‘developed’ countries they enter, but because in the act of refusal by the developed countries the integrity of ‘civilization’ is being condemned. What kind of civilization allows millions of people to die at its doorstep? The damage this does to the contextual fabric of Europe and North America is likely to reveal itself in a horrifying loss of decency, empathy, and integrity.

The notion of the individual entity having agency is confused by a paradox. The confusion lies with the idea of individuation. The entity (organism, person, or organization) is bound to its unique perspective or epistemology, and in that sense is identifiable as a separate source of responsibility. But, there is no aspect of that entity that is uninfluenced, uninformed, or unbound to the larger contextual interactions. On closer examination we begin to see that agency is diffused into the larger contextual processes that are shared by the entire community. Agency is a paradoxical product of mutual learning within and between people, nature, and culture.

Leadership does not reside in a person but in an arena that can be occupied by offerings of specific wisdom to the needs of the community. So leadership is produced collectively in the community, not the individual. The individual’s responsibility is to be ready and willing to show up, serve, and then, most importantly, stand back. Leadership for this era is not a role or a set of traits; it’s a zone of interrelational process. Step in, step out.

The illusion of the prevailing way of thinking is that there is someone to blame—or to praise—as a leader, hero, villain, tyrant, saint or Satan. And that thinking—that is how we got where we are today. Am I writing this book? Or is it the swirling contexts of my culture and family history, my digesting breakfast, my friends, and colleagues that are collectively responsible for this purple prose? I cannot rule out contextual input or the particular sensitivities of my epistemology. Both are relevant. But are they mine? But are they me?

In the ecology of the interdependence of our world, that individualistic idea is wildly out of sync. With blame, as with praise, the causation becomes singular and linear… The problems we face now are neither singular nor linear. So the solutions won’t be either.

The danger of the world’s fascination with celebrity is that it distracts from our ability to perceive larger interactions in context. In a world in which individualism is a viable illusion, collaborative discovery is unseen.

What part of a jungle is the most important? Water? Soil? Insects? Plants? Animals? Geography? Rivers? Air? The jungle in fact is only alive in the living, growing relationships between the processes…

What part of the body is the most important part? Heart? Lungs? Blood? Muscles? Emotions? Dreams? Intellect?

Maybe there was a time when these notions of leadership were useful – but not any more. This global whirl of interrelations and interlocked histories and futures is not waiting for leaders… it’s waiting for the courage to trust each other and to step carefully into the ‘intentional community’ of the 7 billion people we share the commune of life with. This is our tribe. Just the 7 billion of us… and the animals, plants and microorganisms. Those who came before, and those who will follow. That’s all.

So, am I saying that there is no room for teachers? That there is no room for the expert? No. But a good teacher, and a real expert, knows that they are in a process of learning themselves. They are not leaders. They are not making the seeds grow… They are fertilizer, tending to the soil.

By definition, leadership is needed when something has to be done that has never been done before. Meeting unknown circumstances requires rapid and spontaneous learning. In the case of today’s leadership needs, that learning is mutual.Nothing’s Changed

Everyday emptiness in the palm of my hand,

Cupping the shifts of temperature, air resting on folds

Holding nothing was just that.

Singularly receptive.

Then there was something, not much it seemed, in my hand,

Solidly there,

With weight in points of contact,

A circuitry of signals

And new places to edge understanding around.

I let go of the something, and Nothing was not what it had been.

Nothing looked the same,

But newly filled with an imprint, it outlined another realm

Ghosting emptiness,

Crinkled infinity forgetting nothing

of the presence it contains

Isn’t—is granted independence

Giving weight where there is none.

Pulling ‘not there’ into full focus

Mocking that there is nothing to push away.

While collecting invisible knowings,

Nothing’s changed.Framing the Symmetry

Art and Complexity

If you look out the front window of your home you will see something very different than if you look out the back window. It is not our doors that hold us in our trenches, not the gates or walls—it’s the windows. They are the frames through which we see, limit, and define what we can see.

I am not so sure, on some days, that humans are worth saving. They are reckless and mean, destructive and greedy, they are careless and self-centered. Is there anything worse? They abuse sentient animals, pollute, lie, steal, betray…

At this juncture every country on earth is living with pathologies compounded by pathologies. With so little time left to tend to the rivers, forests, children, oceans, air cleanliness, and so few moments remaining to reverse the unraveling of the natural systems of our world, I realize the impossibility of shifting our course. The trenches are deep. It is not, after all, in the monetary interest or the political interest of our existing institutions that they come together and alter the patterns of our living, as they must. It is not our job, nor our nations’ job, to take up the task of a total system change. Anyway, we are too late, we say—the tipping point has come and gone. Sometimes it seems that humanity is a lost cause.

But then, there is art.

The way we think has everything to do with the way we perceive. With our logical, rational frames of reference we can only see small pieces of the larger patterns of our world; but art is impatient, skips over decades of theory, and is either baffling, or stretches perception into new territories of knowing. There are levels of communication that only art can reach. For me, this is where hope waits.

Unlike either religion or science, art does not offer explanation. Through subjectivity, art brews the healing salve of multiplicity. It plunges us into a realm where there is more than one and also more than two versions of truth. We know there is no singular interpretation of a poem, or a sculpture, but we do not know and cannot know what all of the interpretations will be.

I found this paragraph in a letter written in 1922 by William Bateson (my grandfather), to Gregory Bateson (my father). It was written in an effort to console Gregory after his brother Martin had committed suicide. In these few lines of fatherly advice, I see the map of the unique commitment that the generations of Batesons have had toward the study of life.

The faith in great work is the nearest to religion that I have ever got, and it supplies what religious people get from superstition. There is also this difference, that the man of science very rarely hears the tempting voices and very seldom needs a stimulant at all, whereas the common man craves it all the time. Of course there is great work that is not science—great art, for instance, is perhaps greater still, but that is for the rarest and is scarcely in the reach of people like ourselves. Science, I am certain, comes next and that is well within our reach—at least I am sure that it is well within yours…. To set oneself to find out something, even a little bit, of the structure and order of the natural world is, and will be for you I dare foresee, a splendid and purifying purpose, into which you can always withdraw in the periods of suffering that every man must pass through. If you keep your eyes on that, the other things in life look so poor and small and temporary that the pain they give can be forgotten in the greater emotion.

In this letter I can see the passion, and the loneliness, of science as a path alongside an esteem for the arts that is nearly untouchable. The distancing from religion is in contrast to the “purifying purpose” of the pursuit, to “find out something, even a little bit of the structure and the order of the natural world.” Without question, the embracing of this infinite study of life is in its own atheistic way a practice of both care and curiosity. This great work is not a job, it is not a way to gain prestige, nor a book deal—it is a way of staving off the pain and suffering that come with being human. It is learning to learn, both within and about the systems that are inside and outside ourselves, micro, macro, biological, and social. More importantly, it is a way of seeing.

Gregory’s father William used to say that genius can only be found in two places: in art and in nature. He went on to add that, while science would never actually achieve “genius,” it should always be inspired by it. As a film student, I was riddled with guilt for not having followed in my family lineage of science, and I found solace in William’s statement. It vindicated me, or so I thought. It has taken me years to unravel it. As I have begun to understand what he meant, I am starting to think that it might have been easier to be a scientist than an artist.

Why? What was he saying? It has to do with the idea of understanding how this pursuit of structure and order in the natural world has everything to do with context. The tricky part is that both William and Gregory Bateson were familiar with the scintillating paradox of the idea of “structure and order.” Life has structure, certainly, but that structure and order is cradled perpetually in chaos. And while both structure and order carry impressions of solidity to an untrained ear, the Batesons mean something quite different. Together notions of ‘structure,’ ‘order,’ and ‘natural world’ share an underlying assumption of a massive process made up of smaller processes of communication and relation that occur at multiple levels and through time. In short, “structure and order” as such are only solid at the level of “eternal verities.” Since not many of us have figured out what those are, the quest continues.

Eternal verities provide paradoxes too. If there are no eternal verities then that is a verity – and if there are eternal verities then they can only really be eternal if they are all about change, complexity, unpredictability, interaction, confusion, distortion, and so on. They seem to require a necessary flexibility in order to hold ‘truth’ from all the perspectives that the world presents.

‘Structure’ and ‘order’ in Batesonian vernacular are meta-terms. We will get further in our understanding if we think about them like this: the structure of structure, and the order of order. After working with Gregory and William’s ideas for several years I have become increasingly aware of the interrelated vital processes that they refer to as ‘context.’ Sometimes we call that context ‘the system,’ or we label it more specifically as a kind of system: the body, the university, the forest, the globe.

The ‘order’ and ‘structure’ was a scaffolding of patterns around which other patterns might form and shift. “Evolution,” they both said, “is in the context.” Organisms learn and develop in an environment that influences their genotypic evolution, as well as their somatic evolution. The evolution of one species is inherently tied to that of other species that it shares life with. In the century since William first began his studies of contextual inheritance, science has begun to embrace this multifaceted approach to the study of genetics.

The branches of science that first came close to aligning with this holistic search were cybernetics and its subsequently articulated cousin, systems theory. Later developments have reshaped these studies into complexity theory. While there are important differences between these fields, there is much that they share in terms of discovering the dynamic processes of how ecological contexts, or living systems, function. In fact, I would say that without these additions to science (cybernetics, systems theory, and complexity theory), our universities and research institutions would have virtually no capacity for studying either the philosophy or the operations of interrelating patterns in life. Collectively, this work has pushed the need for interdisciplinary thinking to the fore, and generated entire schools of thinking around psychotherapy, ecology, information technology, management, personal development, and more.

However, the project of defining systems science has run the gauntlet of trends in academic and pop culture, and it has been dented here and there along the way. It is, I believe, still the best option for preparing for the changes we are facing globally, but I would caution that care is needed now, as the word ‘system’ itself has gathered meanings that are distracting.

Before we get lost down the rabbit holes of what has become ‘cybernetics, systems theory and complexity theory,’ I want to address the way in which I am inspired by my ancestry’s common thread of attraction to and appreciation of art, toward a new version of contextual research.

As I see it, art allows us to perceive from multiple perspectives simultaneously. In order for science to really work with complexity we need art to help inform science about forming an approach to perceiving.

I maintain that although Gregory’s work was seminal in the formation of cybernetics, systems theory, and complexity, there are departure points that significantly distinguish the tone of his work from that of his colleagues. One such departure point is the way that art and poetry informed the scientific inquiry that both William and Gregory explored. For Gregory, the process through which art might expand and integrate the many parts of the mind was an explicit element of his thinking. Although the source of William’s inspirations was kept closer to his chest, still he inspired Gregory with his love of art and appreciation of poetry and especially (both for art and poetry) of William Blake.

In Steps to an Ecology of Mind, Gregory addresses the way in which art brings multiple aspects of communication and culture together to integrate the conscious and unconscious sense-making of our world. In the chapter, ‘Style, Grace, and Information in Primitive Art,’ he courageously assigns to art the task of doing that which science cannot, namely, to pervade our knowledge with what he calls “grace.” Gregory opens the chapter with a reference to Aldous Huxley’s take on this:

Aldous Huxley used to say that the central problem for humanity is the quest for grace…. He argued—like Walt Whitman—that the communication and behavior of animals has a naiveté, a simplicity, which man has lost. Man’s behavior is corrupted by self-deceit—by purpose, and by self-consciousness.

—Gregory Bateson, Steps to an Ecology of Mind

He goes on to say,

I shall argue that the problem of grace is fundamentally a problem of integration and that what is to be integrated is the diverse parts of the mind.

Blake, like the Batesons, was captivated by an urge to study the structure and the order of life. The insight Blake had into the systems and interrelatedness of life—especially in the tension between man and nature—was a poignant compass in our household, which has informed my work at every level.

Keeping William’s letter in mind, as a plea for his son’s pursuit of pure purpose in the scientific search for the order of life, I invite you to revisit the famous poem of William Blake’s, ‘The Tyger’:

Tyger Tyger, burning bright,

In the forests of the night;

What immortal hand or eye,

Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies.

Burnt the fire of thine eyes?

On what wings dare he aspire?

What the hand, dare seize the fire?

And what shoulder, & what art,

Could twist the sinews of thy heart?

And when thy heart began to beat,

What dread hand? & what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain,

In what furnace was thy brain?

What the anvil? what dread grasp,

Dare its deadly terrors clasp!

When the stars threw down their spears

And water’d heaven with their tears:

Did he smile his work to see?

Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Tyger Tyger burning bright,

In the forests of the night:

What immortal hand or eye,

Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

The poem seems like a forerunner to the questions that Gregory spent his life asking. What is pattern? Not because there was or is an answer, but because the question brought both rigor and imagination into the inquiry. The noticing of each aspect of the tiger’s symmetry and grace is an invitation to another kind of empathy. Who has the right to say how the tiger was made? Who can claim truth over this magnificent collection of ideas and processes?

Blake’s poetic portrait burns with the impossibility of knowing what made this tiger, what forged its remarkable integrations of the brain, the feet, and the heart. Then there is the lamb to consider, which is of course part of the tiger’s set of relationships as well. This is a call to the humility of biology; it is about culture, it is about ecology, it is about psychology, it is about information and communication, it is about behavior, it is about science in its glory, and its failings. The poem brings in many relationships: those within the tiger, those between the reader and nature and science, and the multiple reflections within these relationships to God.

Science and religion have always flanked the path of knowledge. The quest for structure and order requires careful attention. To study the workings of life through inquiry places one on a path where religion is on one side, proclaiming the mystery, and mechanistic application is on the other side, with blueprints. On one side the high priest is ready to save souls and on the other is the eager engineer. Without this tension the field is numb. The contrasting polarities are two ends of the same rope, as they say. Between the two exaggerations are multitudes of great minds, with breaking hearts and good ideas to play with.

Systems thinking on the wire

Framing the structure of life is not for the greedy—neither in religion nor in science. Rather, the starting place is to find the edges of our epistemological window frame, and play with them. To bring the arts into the process of describing living systems is to embrace a questioning about how we think. When we start to study one aspect of life, the complexity will expand the scope of our vision to include much more. As Frank Barron puts it:

The psychology of the individual, the person, is the study of a world in itself. Yet, that world intersects and intermingles with the world of other individuals, so that very soon we must consider community, habitat, the intersection of the personal with cultural history, expectations of the future, and perhaps above all else in the human case, values and philosophy of life.

Creativity and Personal Freedom, p.6

I have seen letters in the Library of Congress where Gregory Bateson is referring to “systems” as early as 1929. He offers a clear definition. The idea of systems began to get traction in the ’50s when cybernetics emerged through the Macy Conferences. Cybernetics grew in the dialogues of those conferences and then found purchase in the larger culture’s love affair with industrial and mechanistic thinking. While cybernetics has brought much needed insight, we have now arrived at a moment in the development of its ideas where they find themselves face-to-face with the polarities of our culture.

I am acutely aware when using the word ‘systems’ in this era that it has meanings that tie into a number of trendy furnishings in the popularized culture of both science and spirituality.

The lens through which we see systems theory or cybernetics or complexity will influence what we do with it. Since our culture has a penchant for mechanistic thinking, it will seek mechanistic versions of systems thinking. And, conversely, since our culture seeks to fill the hole that science dug where religion used to hold the soil in place, unrigorous forms of systems thinking will offer explanation through mystery. In both cases, what is lost is the ability to stretch across the disciplines.

The systems sciences are probably our best chance of adding depth to our understanding of life. To think that there is such a misplaced mechanistic metaphor right in the center of the field is indeed a challenge to take to heart. In fact, if you Google the word systems, and select _resources/books//Small Arcs of Larger Circles_ Framing Thro - Nora Bateson, you will see only a rather bizarre collection of abstract models and diagrams, with boxes and arrows in varying layouts and primary colors. In the first pages of results, not a single living thing is returned by Google to represent the input of systems. I think that is frightening.

I have a bias against those models. I will admit it. I see in them the traps of linear and causal thinking, the notions of control, and the mechanistic approach to life that is repeatedly evident in all aspects of our culture. Perhaps as intellectual crutches they are fleetingly useful, but only if they are then thrown away; because life does not work that way. Complexity does not compress.

The larger conversation that forms an ecology includes all of the organisms interacting and learning. William Bateson said: “Every feather is, as it were, a flag whose shape and coloring denote the values of determining variables at the point and time of its growth.”

The understanding of how living systems learn is not mappable. Some will disagree with that, but the processes are taking place at multiple levels and between multiple parts of a system, and within those parts of systems there are more systems with parts—and all the parts are in communication, and communication is not the same thing as a script.

One example I use is this: imagine you are going to a party, and you want to enjoy meeting other people. In preparation for the party you study, memorize, and practice every line of Hamlet, right down to the emotional expressions and body movements. You will find that your contribution to the conversation is out of sync, unintelligible, perhaps absurd, and meaningless. I am a great fan of Hamlet—it is a script that says important things about life—but living people, living organisms, and living systems do not communicate in scripts. The maps are scripts.

Systems theory is struggling inside a system that doesn’t actually accommodate it

In scientific circles, the systems sciences have become a haven for a modeling and explanatory language for how to deal with complex problems. This would be OK, except that the linearity and the mechanistic principles of reductionism in western culture have wormed their way into the systems vocabulary. The result is that we get strategic methodologies and defined models for fixing isolated issues within complex living interactions that have a living context. To put it more bluntly, the old way of addressing problems—by defining causality and applying predetermined formulized ‘actions’ to ‘solve’ the problem defined—has become painted into the terms and language of the new systems and complexity disciplines. The vocabulary has changed, but the thinking remains the same. ‘Recursive’ becomes a word that brings to mind a series of boxes connected by arrows, and ‘decoupling’ seems now to refer to a mechanistic split in systems linkages.

Something is getting lost in the ether of new age oneness. Or else it slips down the other side of the cliff into engineering. This is rigor and imagination, yet it is all out of balance and distributed weirdly across our epistemological horizon.

Interconnected

There is a sort of fashionable thrust right now toward popularizing systems thinking, encouraged by ecology celebrities looking for a way to make more palatable the bad news about the ecosystem, and how we can respond to it. It has crossed into the genre that includes the western misunderstanding of ‘interconnectedness.’ You might hear something like the cry for unity in our world and ecosystem in the slogan ‘we are one with the planet.’ This has by all accounts the benevolent intention to change the sickness in our thinking that leads us to imagine that we are NOT one with our planet. It is an improvement, I hope. But it is an improvement that comes at a high cost. Perhaps the cost is indeed too high.

The concept of interconnectivity has become a sloppy way of addressing the vast tangle of interactions in a living system. The very idea of interconnectedness has allowed lines to be drawn lazily between nodes or parts of the whole system. The world may be able to use the terms of systems thinking, but some of the thinking has lost its real value and become muddled into something more akin to ‘oneness.’

The deepening of our understanding of how the vast variables and interactions in the natural world are functioning will inform our actions; it will inform our ethics, our choices, and our epistemological frame. Take out the vast variables and replace them with oneness, and you lose the differences, the information, the aesthetics of interaction, the evolution, the complexity, the life. Unity is not about oneness, it requires the process of uniting, which requires relationality.

Gregory’s concept of “the difference that makes a difference” requires that the relationships inside a system be communications of contrast. The gecko that catches its food by seeing the insect’s movement is an example of a pattern of cognition and evolution that exists between species. Yes, they are interconnected. No, they are not in a big oneness. The differences are beautiful, and they matter. In the study of structure and order of life, which William Bateson refers to above, these are the rich co-evolutionary forms that offer insight into all sorts of other systems.

In this sense, to suggest that systems thinking can offer a scientific overtone to a spiritual movement is to miss the more rigorous intellectual pursuit that systems thinking ideas can deliver. It’s a rip-off. In fact, the beauty and awe that can be generated by seeing the world as a nest of millions, billions, and trillions of interdependencies interacting with each other across time and geography is profound. But, it is not a profundity that asks for vacant surrender; instead it beckons for study, for art, for active learning.

Uncertainty

Then there is uncertainty—another curse and blessing brought on by systems and complexity thinkers. Without doubt, the tone of our studies becomes poisoned with hubris and this is evident in the application of most scientific discoveries. Whether it be medicine, space travel, or other technology, we are too often sure that we have cracked the code of nature and found the answers we need, and that is usually the moment at which we brazenly commit the most destruction. So, uncertainty is healthy. It can change the tone of our approach, make us humble, give a pause, and cool off the arrogance that comes with the sense of having found ‘solutions.’

We cannot know all the millions of relational interactions in our own digestive process, let alone the larger ecology we are disrupting with genetic modification of our food. We should take that uncertainty seriously. We do not know why two people fall in love or fall out of it—and we should take that seriously too. In this form, uncertainty is good.

But uncertainty has also become a sort of island of intellectual excuses—reasons for deferring deeper study. The problem with making a place for mystery is that it so easily gets co-opted into an eddy, where ideas go in easy circles instead of lending themselves to the movement of a wider stream. While there is a kind of sweetness and beauty to this deferral, it is also an entry point to binary thinking. There soon exist in that epistemology just two categories: that which we know and that which we do not. This is a divide that soon gains potency and can contaminate our work: both in terms of what we feel we can understand, which assumes a more rigid and possibly arrogant form, and that which we can’t, which turns to fluff and quickly blows away in the wind.

I would suggest a more modest motivation, which is neither to completely understand nor to label as mystery, but to simply deepen our understanding. The deepening is not finding the answer, not looking for a final truth, but becoming increasingly familiar with the many complexities that surround all that we study. We will never understand it completely, but we can continue (endlessly) to increase our comprehension of the variables at play. As William said, “to find out something, even a little bit, of the structure and order of the natural world….”

Integration of many levels

Art and nature share the genius of contextualizing multiple levels of relatedness and communication at the same time, and across time. A painting is a study of relationships of color, of culture, of subject, of framing, of light, of concepts, and of perspective. The meaning that is found in the visual metaphor today can, and will, change in ten minutes—and in a hundred years. These meanings vary between people and between cultural references. Likewise, a pond is a possibility to study all the relationships that make it: the water, the algae, the fish, the bacteria, the insects, the birds, the micro-organisms, the leaves on the shore, and the animals that drink and feed from it—now, a hundred years from now, and a hundred years ago. So, where is the art? Where is the pond? In the relationships.

In contrast, the planned and strategized cultural mandates of our social norms do not give voice to the multiple threads of information needed to make decisions. Nor does our daily professional vernacular communicate the unseen interruptions that are made in our haste to solve problems. The use of names and categories to save time is valid. But these outlines are arbitrary. The tendency is to remember the names and forget the other possible ways of seeing. Like the horse with blinders on, or the pointed focus of a camera lens, we shut out information. We have an unspoken agreement that we will not blur the interactions of specific issues that in fact desperately need to be blurred to see their integration.

The professional adult tone of respectability and credibility is monotone and singular. It says, “I am not capricious, and won’t be fooled by the flim-flam of ‘complexity’; I can be objective and level-headed about what needs to be done.” But subjectivity is gone. Purposefully stamped out. Professionalism and authority demand a tone and an approach that is unswayable. Of course the evidence is in our back pocket, the facts, the statistics, the graphs, and indicators all point to one simple truth, and that is what we will clearly and willfully state. But is that possible? Is it a cultivated lie?

The subjectivity of our perspectives gives depth and information to everything we see. Information is lost in the masking of subjectivity. Interactions are lost.

I am remembering a time when I was asked by the Saybrook Institute in San Francisco to teach a workshop on complexity. I was thrilled to join their classroom of grad students who were studying the noble material on complexity, but when I read the sheet that described my contribution, I blanched. It said something like this: “Nora Bateson will join us for a workshop in which she will present a feminine perspective on complexity.”

“What? What is that?” I thought. I have certainly studied my share of feminism, and that was fine. And I have certainly studied my share of complexity, and that was fine… but what in the world is a feminine perspective on complexity?

I arrived at the class, a wonderful group of about 30 bright and eager students, all poised and ready to receive this illumination, and promptly asked them: “Does anyone here have any idea what a feminine perspective on complexity is?” They were unsure for a moment whether they had been sold a faulty teacher, or whether there was a trick. Of course neither was the case. I found I had to describe my predicament with care and honesty.

I am a woman, yes, and I can only speak as a woman. I cannot remove the woman-ness from who I am. But I am also many, many other things and play many other roles in life. I cannot surgically or otherwise remove any of those influences or experiences from who I am at any given moment. I am complex. We all are.

One student pointed out that, with the addition of more versions of herself in her work, she was freed from the obligation of representing a particular cultural or disciplinary perspective. With her newfound subjectivity she could employ a much richer perspective on her work. She could present herself as more than her race, more than her gender, more than her religion and so on.

There is no room for racism, or religious discrimination, or professional insult, if we can begin to see each other and ourselves as multifaceted in our complexity. Seen in this way, our subjectivity offers a voice uniquely ours to speak from. The epistemological frame through which I and you, and the rest of the world’s population, see the world is a living invocation of all of our experiences and reflections, mixed into memory and learning. The subjectivity of our perspectives is what gives depth and in-form-ation to everything we see.

We can pretend to remove those voices, but we can never actually do so. They are there in everything we say and do. In the way we listen, in the way we watch, in the way we touch, and the way we receive touch.

Art informs knowledge

Art lets us be subjective without asking us to commit medieval surgery on the vocabulary of our impressions. Art asks us to meet it with our particular-ness exposed and open. Art changes. It cannot be pinned down. It is un-located. Unreasoned. Unproven.

Meanings change when we receive them through different lenses. Ask any room of people to describe what a Magritte painting means to them and each person will have a different take. Start back at the beginning and yet another set of meaningful observations will arise. We are allowed to move in art. The ecology of our ideas and epistemological limitations is permitted another sort of oxygen altogether when art is the subject.

Art is free to move through culture and time, to reverberate the outlines of a particular moment in history against others that are unmentioned. Art pulls perception toward the differences between light, notes, color, subjects, framings, ideas, emotions, and stories. Art speaks in relationships. It is relationships. And we are in relationship to it and each other. All this relatedness is a mess of entangled, shifting impressions and associations. It is, in that sense, alive, much like a pond or a forest. Art is a system of systems, which we enter with our additional systems—our perceptions, our sense, our thoughts and histories, our personal injuries, our educations, our willingness, and maybe our sense of humor.

Art is un-located, and it un-locates us. We are not exactly sure where the art is. Is the music in the notes? Or the rhythm? Or the musicians? Or the audience? Or the era? Is the painting in the colors, in the artist, in the subject, in the viewer? Is the poem in the words or between them? Is it in the poet’s head? Or is it in ours? Where is the art? It is in the relationships, and in our relationship to it. It is in the subjectivity of the observer, and the subjectivity of the artist, and the very capacity to explore all the levels of information that those realms unleash.

Art is unreasoned. It does not apologize. My father, once said, “Poetry is not a sort of distorted and decorated prose, but rather prose is poetry which has been stripped down and pinned to a Procrustean bed of logic.” (Steps to an Ecology of Mind, p.136.)

You may remember that Procrustes was a figure of Greek mythology who took it upon himself to make sure that passers-by would fit his iron bed. He did this by either trimming or stretching them to the right size. Art does not fit in this Procrustean way. But instead there is a constant shifting and fitting of a different kind, in the minds and hearts of the both the artists and the audience. Each space left free, each metaphor opened, is fitting to those who come in contact with it. It is there for the subjective perceptions of each individual to form ideas and memories around, to make sense of in their own way. Combined with skill, talent, imagination, and a whole collection of other lifelong practices, art digs below the surface of our conscious planning.

But most importantly, in this moment, art can teach us the value of information that does not demand proof. Art serves as a complement to the realm of science in this capacity. Bravely, Gregory said,

Not only can we not predict into the next instant of the future, but, more profoundly, we cannot predict into the next dimension of the microscopic, the astronomically distant, or the geologically ancient. As a method of perception—and that is all science can claim to be—science, like all other methods of perception, is limited in its ability to collect the outward and visible signs of whatever may be truth. Science probes, it does not prove.

Gregory Bateson, Mind and Nature

We live in a world of evidence. Our cities’ infrastructures and our environmental planning, our school curricula and our economic predictions, are all filtered through the funnel of data that compiles mechanisms of ‘science.’ Fair enough. We need to know what the new bridge will cost, or how many chemo treatments the patient can withstand; we need to calculate and measure the success of our work. But it is clear that we have made some serious miscalculations in the last 100 years. All the proof in the world has not provided the information that we need to see the complexity of the world we live in. We do not understand it. We make decisions that unfold into wild and unforeseen consequences. The proof was not enough. We needed the pattern.

Art does not ask for proof; it directs us to look for pattern.

Strung between the chords of a flamenco song is the empathy of a thousand years of love and pain. In the gestures of a contemporary dancer we can remember all that we have never imagined, and follow the form of the body into an unknown dictionary of emotions. In the strokes of color on a London wall, we find the humor and irony of our own mistakes. On a canvas, in a photo, on the screen, we see ourselves seeing the world. We see it, we see us, we take in the cock-eyed framing that tilts our heads and rests our status quo on its ear. The poetry is there, un-killable. Each of us is an artist, dabbing rhythms, colors, metaphors, and harmonies into our moments.

While abstract concepts may rollercoaster through us in art we don’t understand, the metaphors still enter us, and one day, maybe years ahead, they will speak to us. In the gruesomeness of art we find we are vulnerable and that we bleed. I have a small poster of Picasso’s ‘Woman Weeping’ on my dresser to remind me that to be a student of life is to be willing to be shattered. The darkness in art gives us a visceral experience of being dug up, emptied of the seeds of trust, and carved into the anger or jealousy that has overtaken us. There are things to be angry about in life, and art lets us explore the community of that experience. Through the breaking, tingling, crackling, smoothing, and opening, we are in art, with unnamed resonances coursing through us. We are pulled from our illusion that we can watch life from our safe place at the window. We are participants in the process.

In all forms, art can offer an experience of integration that calls upon our cultural language of symbols, our imagination, our history, our intellect, and our emotions. While we often stress the importance of ‘creative expression,’ it is perhaps more vital at this moment in our history to explore what art has to say about the possibility that our perception itself can be brought into larger circuits of cognition through metaphor. Appreciation of a piece of art can be seen as recognition of the pattern that connects. As I see it, art allows us to perceive from multiple perspectives simultaneously. In order for science to really work with complexity, we need art to help give scientists a more developed capacity to perceive context, one that includes all the disciplines, emotions, cultural symbols, and personal memories. As Blake said in ‘The Grey Monk’: “A tear is an intellectual thing.”

Your fingers cover my eyes before you leave, so I won’t see you go.

I will see only

The tiny circle of your lips—just there. Whispering to my thigh.

and my lips on you—just there. My hair spilled across your belly.

Moving in our special private elsewhere melodies.

And entwined we are lost at long last in versions of found

like a new botanical to be sketched

unknown, unbelieved.

I will never be able to resist you, my back will arch and my skin will blush.

Soft thoughts go smoldering southward into your body’s invitation,  
tongue traveling across your landscape.

My mind knows that you are gone, but my body is going to keep searching for you

Your outlines signal through the windows of my days.

Can you come sleep inside my secrets? There is stillness for you there.

Ringing electric spits of flashing clarity in symphonic intuition scream: “Grab this, and unleash it. Give it form.”

We are almost possible.

We have been renaming the waters,

Your hands around my waist unwrapped the most delicate trust

They have been honeying history.

And your voice tumbles into the foundations of my being dropping locks and holding my ocean in warm webs when you sing,

sing,

for me.Reckless

The ecology of recklessness is alive with the courage to shun a toxic normalcy; to recognize a misalignment as success and success as misalignment. What does it mean to be healthy in an unhealthy system? Does sanity not require the madness to live otherwise? Another wise.

The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.

Jack Kerouac, On the Road

At a recent session on Big Data I got a super-sized tummy ache. It appears to be the beanstalk sprouted from quantitative magic beans and binary rain. Huge scoops of numbers get formed into patterns that are totally decontextualized, and then, good heavens, and then we call it information. At the session they referred to Big Data as the new oil. It is not noble. It is for sale. The thing about numbers is that they pretend to be ‘objective,’ they carry a tone of ‘facts & figures,’ when in fact they are objectifying and are much more slippery in the stories they carry than poetry.Non-Trivial Economy

I am not an economist. Consequently, this is maybe the shortest analysis of our global economic conundrum you will read today.

I remember a passage my dad once wrote that cautioned against “trivializing” our understanding of ecology into commerce and politics. It has taken me years to understand what he meant. Today that admonition seems to hold more resonance than ever. Over time I realized that while nature is swarming with co-evolution with or without humanity on board, “commerce and politics” are constructs, ideas, premised upon the errors of the Cartesian split—and must not be given the keys to the bus.

It would be a mistake to think that we can change our way of thinking about the larger ecology we live within by changing commerce or politics. Our ways of living and thinking trace over each other so that we can hardly say which is reaffirming which. Like Ouroboros, the snake that eats its tail, we live in our thoughts and think in our life patterns. At present, commerce seems to darken the ink on both.

We cannot depend upon our economic system or the political system to get us out of the horse race with collapse that we sense coming. For that we need something else. But the hitch is that it is also a mistake to think we can do it without traction in those realms. Like sticky honey, the enchantment of the political and economic patterning has touched everything from education to medicine, from the arts to the charities. In that sense the place to start is, ironically perhaps, with the economy.

And here we come in. Can we generate a non-trivial narrative?

What is the difference between non-trivial and trivial? For me: the trivial has been cut from its context, isolated and fragmented. The nontrivial is intact. Commerce and politics may not be able to provide a way to this intactness, that much is clear. But, without commerce and politics we cannot adjust the ecology of our thinking—ideas of life, ideas of each other, ideas of survival, ideas of success, ideas of love. These are all inextricably in interaction. Our human evolution, in collaboration with the natural world, is dependent upon the evolution of our ideas of what commerce and politics are.

Our narrative, like nature, will need to be non-trivial because it is broad, because the commerce we speak of is that which is inclusive of a field of contextual crossovers, linkages, and sticky-zones (remember the honey everywhere).

I am thinking about how to make commerce non-trivial. In what circumstances can a ‘something’ be of economic value without being commodified, objectified, exploited? Can we imagine an economy that does not commodify life? People trafficking is perhaps the most disgusting example of this. But it should come as no surprise to the society that has made a luxury market of natural foods, safety, education and so on that the monetary value of our world would overtake all else.

The recent discussion of limiting water usage or carbon emissions as ecological measures contains a suspicious message of ‘value.’ Is it not a probability that, by mandating limits with penalty fees on water and carbon emissions, access to excess will come to be considered a luxury? Increasing the price of water is liable to encourage golf courses to show off their green lawns and leave poor families bathing their children in third generation grey water. To value nature, or living systems within a monetary system, immediately trivializes them into something objectified and exploitable. The basic notion of ownership undermines the non-trivial. Can the intactness of the non-trivial replace the current idea of wealth?

A new narrative would be one in which the collusion of the planet’s ecologies, both cultural and biological, is a given. We would not have to list the many aspects of life that need to be ‘valued’ if our economic thinking were non-trivial. As a mother I have never had to make a list in the morning of all the things I need to do for the survival of my children. I would even suggest that the making of these lists might be an indicator of a commercial culture that has fragmented the world into disposable, replaceable products.

What will this new narrative look like? Perhaps it is a reverence for that which it has become clear cannot be bought or sold. Relationships between people and within the biosphere are alive. They cannot be traded.

It is difficult to imagine what the model of this new narrative would look like. The existing epistemology of trade and commerce flows through the landscape of all of life at present. We buy groceries to survive, we buy gas and shoes with money we earn through our employment. The presumption is that that’s the way it is; how else can we live? But there is nothing normal, permanent, or natural about this state of affairs; it is our collective imagination that maintains it from one day to the next. A choice that now we cannot imagine survival without.

The words that we have to describe an alternative form of economics are perverted by the frame they are bound in. ‘Sharing,’ ‘membership,’ ‘circular economy,’ all of these emerging models smell funny from this juncture. Each of these alternatives is characterized by a new set of operating instructions. There are teams of great people trying desperately to draw up these rule books with diagrams of the new economy. They are tireless in their work, and their schemes are lovely, fascinating, and complicated re-examinations of the abstraction of whatever ‘money’ is. We humans need money to live, like we need air and water, but no other creature has currency.

Instructions are interesting, but they are at another order than the one in which this shift into a valuation of the non-trivial will occur, if it occurs. The deeper imprinted notions of the non–trivial are not created, maintained, or substantiated with instructions, models, or policy. To return to the metaphor of the parent and child, the child’s breakfast happens without external structures describing how it should take place. Parenting books might suggest recipes, time schedules, manners, and nutritional values, but breakfast is a presupposition whose absence denotes more serious problems. Parents’ delivery of breakfast for their children is written into the relationship.

There is something more serious than economy preventing the interrelationships with each other and the biosphere from being tacitly nontrivial. Perhaps it is the notion of ownership within the idea of money.

As my father said in my film, “You can’t possess relationships. I do not know how many relationships go into making this rather beautiful thing [his hand], and relationships between relationships and relationships of relationships of relationships.”

I am in the business of helping people to see the interrelationality of life. I believe that money is in the way of that process.

What is a banana?

Cultivated through a history of landscapes, agriculture, labor,

A banana is a lot of relationships.

A banana in the context of my household is a relatively bland yellow fruit that my husband uses to make his morning smoothie thicker.

But I was born in Hawaii and hid under banana leaves when the sudden tropical rain came.

A banana is future banana trees, baby food, potassium.

A banana is contextual.

At a banana plantation the individual banana is not so precious, but the health of banana-ability is crucial.

If I offered you my sofa, and you offered me a banana, I would feel unappreciated. (FEEL!!!)

A banana is not just a banana. It is a collection of contextual relationships and its value is too.

But… sell that banana for a dollar, and the banana ceases to be relational or contextual, and becomes an object of trade.

It is objectified. Bought and sold, the banana can be said to be owned. Commodification of the banana is a by-product of its having been stripped of its contextual relationships. The valuation does not matter, once the relationality has been deleted. How we see a banana is what matters. The idea of its being purchased is an idea that carries a privilege of blindness to its ecology.

And what about an hour of work?

My hours, your hours.

Hours prepared for, hours away from sick children.

Hours that have pulled us from writing and thinking and put our hands in the dirt of our gardens.

Hours of labor on banana plantations,

Lawyers’ hours serving labor law,

Boycott bananas to speak for the conditions under which the labor is stolen from plantation workers.

Hours are not hours, they are contextual relations.

Time, bought and sold.

Money is the permission for one set of relations to be erased and replaced by monetary contexts.

Prostitution offers the buyer a purchased distance from the context of emotion.

The reason we can sell off everything for money is that it allows us to NOT SEE the relationships.

Thinking of the many new economies that proliferate in the possibility realm—sharing economies, caring economies, green economies, circular economies, etc.—

I wonder if they are all potentially off-topic.

Perhaps the issue is not the shape and flow of economy, but the idea of currency.

Currency decontextualizes.

What if we need to rethink what money is?

Currency that holds relationality.

You cannot sell or buy relationships.

Perhaps currencies that could illustrate relation would help?

Labor currency?

Living currency (life forms from the land, oceans, air)?

Artisan currency?

Intellectual currency?

Technical currency?Liminal

If you lie to me, my skin will know.

I won’t notice,

But the undercurrents will rearrange.

Minds, mouths and limbs all clamor for ungiven providence.

But each domain is somehow an empty house.

We are not there.

We are in the scent of a gaseous brew.

Forested with silence that is curating our signals,

Our aggregate is music-ing.

If something is broken—the fixing is in the alchemy of our breath.

If you are half here,

I am half there, finding you.

If your glance goes blank, and your hands don’t seek me in your sleep,

The breakfast we share might be photography.

We might be unfed.

Recultivating is a field of fingertips, returning curious—a bodysuit of taste buds.

Tending to the touch of our drifting thoughts,

Listening to the flavor of our gestures.

Meet me in our particular eternity.An Ecology of Hurt

Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.

—St. Luke’s Gospel

Is forgiveness an intellectual thing?

Is it emotional?

Shall I find it in my heart to offer forgiveness to those who have hurt me?

How is it done? Do I make up my mind to leave my anger and hurt behind and extend myself in the name of peace and compassion?

Is forgiveness mine to give?

Or, is this instruction just a little pile of words, abstracted and disembodied from our personal evolution?

If I cannot find the operative functions in myself to ‘forgive,’ will my soul be tormented in gloomy negativity?

Will I be hostage to my bitterness and anger?

Will I be holding a grudge?

In this essay I take for granted that we have all experienced our inner world pounding with hurt and rage. I presume that we all know the pain of being misunderstood, insulted, humiliated, and damaged, betrayed, and slandered. In the heat of that rage some well-intending friend usually suggests that we simply “forgive and move on.” They will say, “you cannot live in this anger; it is not good for you, you need to let it go.”

Non-forgiveness is a horrible existence. In my experience I have found that resentment eats time, and pulls poison threads between the head and heart. It is no way to live.

By ‘let it go’—what we really mean is ‘let go of your current way of making sense of what has happened.’

Just as the events around the transgression were complex, just as I am complex, you are complex. The whole of the problem (whatever it may be) is complex, and requires a parallel complexity to meet it. We might hope for an easier way out, or wish we could offer a conceptual vanishing trick to the person or institution that has injured us.

I imagine uttering the magic words, “I forgive you”—and poof, pain and conflict are gone. But forgiveness is not actually something you give, or make, or force. Forgiveness is about something learned.

What I have found in the return from my darkest moments is that learning must take place. Not just any learning, but learning that bridges the emotional, intellectual, and physical realms. I am speaking now of learning that lets all of those faculties rest again in newly found knowing that whatever the nature of the injury, we can find our way back to safety.

In order to not live like titanium robots, we have to feel. So, it hurts when people are mean. Even some unknown person on the bus, or a grumpy salesclerk, can tear a hole in the day. We are more like jellyfish, squishy enough to hold the waters of life, but vulnerable. The fact that someone can hurt me means I care. Caring enables us to learn, perhaps because the resentment is too difficult to sustain. Learning means we can heal and evolve.

There are levels of betrayal and pain that I have experienced that I hesitate to share. We all carry our wounds; no one gets a free ride. There have been moments when I was so devastated that I thought I would never be whole again, that I would always be shattered. Being alive seems to require that we each take a few turns plumbing the depths of despair. I have always treated these times as an orienteering challenge for me to find my way back from the abyss, bruised and broken, but stronger for the journey.

Life seems to demand that we each find the fire of anger, and burn in it. Sorrow has enveloped me at times. But the pivot point is my frustration at my own inability to see a situation for the danger it holds. From that position I find that I am repeatedly trying to trust those who should not be trusted.

On an intellectual level, I understand that those who have betrayed me did not know the streams of harm they were unleashing. But that is not enough is it? The intellect can accept, while the heart and body still thrash in pain. In my heart I want to want to forgive. I want peace, but the tearing spreads across the body. Tears are not only sentimental, they are also physical and intellectual.

I have found it can take time to find the multiplicity within a particular injury we have encountered. Somehow history has to uncover a balance inside of this gash in one’s identity. As if it were a new limb, we have to re-ecologize this event into our world so that we can live in it.

In this sense the mutual learning can appear one-sided. The calibrations I make to become more familiar with a particular danger in life are not easily shared. But surely the adjustments are sensed. I would not venture to say how. These calibrations are sometimes conscious, and largely not. We learn to know the situation and ourselves within it at many levels.

I am reminded of a time when my son was bullied by a boy in 5th grade who wiped dog-poop on him every day at school. It took him weeks to tell anyone because he was so ashamed. That afternoon in the living room we practiced saying the words “back off” in a voice that came from my son’s ‘I-mean-it’ place. It took a while, but finally after an hour or so he found what we called his ‘thunderous roar.’ The next day at school he was ready to use that voice. The boy with poop on a stick approached him to smear him with humiliation, and my son took a breath and was about to say his “back off,” when the boy changed his mind. Somehow they both knew the relationship had shifted. I cannot give what I learn to the person who has trespassed against me. In fact, usually the learning itself is a moment at which the pain is not healed so much as it becomes obsolete.

I have no idea where this learning takes place in me. I assume it is not locatable in a particular vein of thought, or aspect of being, but rather that it is distributed everywhere. I must have an insight into how this situation is to be avoided in the future, and even my body has to know that this violation has offered possible expansion (or contraction) to the whole system of my life. In that sense I do not offer my forgiveness. I set my sights on a time when I will have found a way to learn from what happened.

I am not talking about a pat life lesson or a clever quote from a wise celebrity, but the kind of learning that alters the way I perceive the situation. The landscape will change, but I do not know how to change it, or the ways in which its contours will be redrawn. Learning to go to the abyss of despair and get back is like a multi-layovered flight through the terminals of all sorts of human-to-human error.

In the process of learning, rage and pain lose their charge. In that sense, forgiveness—if it exists—is a whole contextual renovation. The whole relationship with all its tentacles of connection shift tone, shift sentiment.

To accept that my wrongdoers “know not what they do” pales in comparison to the fact that I know not how to handle it. Handling hardship is a many faceted process. It is in our family, our finance, our bodies, our emotions, our idea of right and wrong.

The concept of forgiveness is shifty when it is an idea abstracted from the messy layers the pain winds through. Should I feel bad for being mad? Should I feel bad then for the original insult, and additionally harbor remorse for feeling insulted? Which should I try to un-feel first? Is un-feeling any way to gain sensitivity and deeper learning? I may be scorned for saying so, and people may ask, “what kind of a person does not promote forgiveness?” Who am I to suggest that the act of ‘forgiveness’ is fraudulent?

Have we misinterpreted the New Testament? Or were they really dealing in such abstract modes of thought? It seems we are inextricably wound and bound into the paradox of forgiveness.

First, one is angry or hurt, then on top of it, there is remorse for the experience of anger or hurt that should be relieved with this thing called forgiveness. Faking forgiveness, like faking orgasms, is not good for the overall ecology of the relationship. The wound, even in its purely emotional form, can be smoothed on the surface while the underlayers begin to detach. Falsified, they become bloodless, and lose circulation in the relationship. Detaching is the opposite of connecting. The drifting begins.

Isolation is the inverse of ecology. Forgiveness as an applied principle of ‘moving on’ or ‘getting over it’ may in fact derail the ecological process of discovery within the ecology of the pain. In this way forgiveness is a psychobabble-bully making the complexity of the relationship shrink down and be quiet.

I want to suggest that forgiveness as a token of high morality is not an effective strategy for achieving peace. The fact that it is packaged as a peacemaking tool of active compassion is even messier. I have a hard time figuring out what people mean when they suggest forgiveness as a solution. How do you do that? I cannot imagine that there is a way I can beam a kind of grace bubble, with my magic wand, around those that have betrayed my trust, or violated my world in some way. Seriously?

I can think in bold letters “I FORGIVE that person.”

I can write a card with those words in it.

I cannot actually give away forgiveness; it is not in my possession.

The most I can give is time.

The fact of “knowing not what they do” does nothing for the pain. Surely we never know what we are doing, or how others will interpret our deeds. You do not say to a child who touches a hot stove, “forgive the stove, it didn’t mean to burn you.” Or to someone who picks up a poisonous viper, “forgive the little snake, it did not mean to bite you.” We don’t say those things because obviously forgiveness is irrelevant to the child with the burned fingers. The child is merely expected to learn from the experience. There is no need to be angry at the stove, no need to hold a grudge, the need is to learn where and when to touch it.

Learning is the key. Once the child learns how to interact with the stove without getting hurt, the child is free—until a new learning arises. Caution may manifest as a process of learning to learn. With learning comes the capacity to learn again. To be alive is to accept the possibility of pain, and to know that one day another form of pain will manifest.

What happens when we zoom out and examine transgressions that are not personal, but are political, national, or religious? What sort of reaction and interaction can expand our capacity to respond in ways that create less trauma over time? The larger ecologies within which the transgressions of humiliation, exploitation, and vengeance are found require a response with far more capacity for complexity than surface-level forgiveness. Global volatility is not decreasing as the boundaries of economy, ecology, and socio-political governance blur. Multinational corporate business, climate change, and war/terror are manifesting large-scale people movement, poverty, and trauma. The approach to these painful situations is of paramount importance. We will all live in the stories as they play out in decades to come, just as we are now living in the aftermath and with the consequences of decisions made in the early and mid-20th century.

One approach:

1. Define a polarity.

2. Add trauma and drama.

3. Panic in search of a solution while the situation blooms into cascading and overlapping destruction.

4. Define a solution within another polarity

5. Repeat steps 2-5 indefinitely.

When that gets too painful and repetitive we might try this approach:

1. Allow complexity.

2. Pause the impulse to find cause.

3. Increase mutual learning within the situation.

4. Previously un-seeable possibilities appear

5. Repeat steps 1-5 indefinitely

There are infinite ways to approach approaching.Quo Vadis? (for Tobbe)

I see you.

Pausing between fast forward and tumbling back

Winding into snarls of shiny ribbon

coming undone.

Chaos is composing you in impressionistic looseness,

Colors washed in an unexpected retreat of your plan

Broadcasting lostness in squeaky harmonies.

With Doppler effect.

Dear one—travel like the back-packers we once were!

Mock the control!

Right knob. Wrong button. Stop. Pause.

Time to play.

You know the rhythm in the hum of your bones

as natural as the resonance of bees, below the frequency of the dull din.

The script you are memorizing is unwritten.

Erase any ink you think

Ride friend. Like a saggy pants skateboarder.

Like a five-year-old with frozen nose water on a sled.

Like the day we climbed across the moonlight painting paths on the water.

Wisdom is breath. The inhale of effort

and release of that which you have been given

To give.

It’s a letter to yourself that pleads, “don’t go.”

You were formed from the irresistible ripening of summer fruit

In the sweetness dripping messy impossibleness

Restored in contact.

You are safe in the crooked gesture of a branch reaching across a meadow

Pointing to the other horizon

Where angels spin stories in dizzying mazes across uncertainty

drawn in birds

…in flight.

Wings on capricious winds,

Drop occasional feathers that float and balance in song

On the tips of grass blades.

They are afraid in the delicate intimacy they convey

Just like us.

How does one write about questioning the way we define sexual inequality to a grouping of people from around the globe? I have been given this task by a group of colleagues with whom I attended a conference. I am daunted. As I write this piece I keep in mind a readership of many professions, cultures, and ages. I have no idea how to speak on this difficult topic across these oceans of cultural ideological absolutes, but I do know that it is vital to try. It is messy to jumble perspectives; cultural and personal frames triangulate against a maze of media, religion, language, and professional know-how. I would like to believe that the mix-up of our world visions will allow a depth of understanding that is desperately needed, and perhaps it would lead to questions that would otherwise remain unspoken. I cannot speak for women, or the west, or the young or the old; I cannot speak for the ecologists or the anthropologists. I can only rummage around in my own set of experiences that give vocabulary to my lens. Nor can anyone else speak for these groups. This is a personal account.

‘Context’ was the title of the family therapy conference in Singapore, in which a kind of trust between professionals occurred that I have rarely, if ever, encountered. Through this trust a dangerous conversation about sex took place across multiple cultures. I was reminded of ‘Rashomon,’ the famous film in which Akira Kurosawa told the tale of many witnesses to a murder and rape who each gave contradictory accounts of what they saw. Our session was an ad hoc, meta communicating, cross-cultural pilot program for those who no longer want to wait around for the real conversation to begin. To be fair, this was not part of the conference plan. The conversation that took place was not on the agenda. It is likely it could not happen again. The mirrors of cultural communication we entered moved me, and in doing so also rearranged some ideas I thought were immovable. I would like, in this chapter, to try to describe the shift in my own thinking without falling down a tunnel of culture-centric assumptions.

I was already squirming in my seat in the freezing cold air-conditioned theater when the afternoon presentation began with a five minute video clip of a husband and wife in Taiwan who were no longer having sex. The wife, in her early thirties, did not want to have sex with her husband because he had forced her to do so early in the marriage. She no longer trusted him. In the clip, the therapist was sensitive to the fact that the husband’s needs were not being met. The wife said she could not accept her husband in a sexual way again until he apologized. But when he did, she sensed it was a shallow apology. I thought it sounded as though it was given not from the recognition of having done something wrong, but more like a negotiation to trade what he needed in order to get the result desired (sex with his wife). The wife demanded another apology. The therapist encouraged both of them to pursue a more sincere apology, and after some time she was satisfied with the sentiment she received.

Watching this clip, I was shivering. The definitions of marriage, of sex, of rape, of culture, of communication, and of healing were tumbling. The video of this therapy session became a watery reflection of the serrated borders of my cultural frame. I plunged into this blur and found a clarity I hope never to lose, a treasure in the pool of cultural confusion. But it did not come easily. Without the mixture of perspectives on the panel session we had after the clip was shown, this incredible opening might never have occurred.

Apparently, to get any new vista within cultural blindness one has to meet the edges, and go beyond them. After the clip, I was raging. The way in which the video played into my sense-making process set my meter for gender injustice into the flaming red danger zone. Just when I was considering taking a bathroom break to escape the room, Maimunah (Mai), the conference chair leaned over and whispered in my ear: “Would you mind leading the discussion panel after this tape, and talk about patterns?” “I don’t think that is a very good idea.” I whispered back. But it was.

So much illusion fills the cultural lens that not only do we not know we are looking through it, but we also do not imagine that others could possibly see differently. I live in a culture other than the one I was born into. In a way, you could say, I have been primed for this moment for decades, perhaps my whole life. I still did not see it coming. I knew the videotape had made me uncomfortable. I am always ill at ease with therapists’ videotaped sessions being presented in conferences. For me as a filmmaker, the violence of this voyeurism is a no-fly zone. I would never expose someone’s personal pain in this way publicly. Even though the patients’ identity is protected, these films still feel exploitative to me. Video is public. Sex troubles between husband and wife are private. The representational ethics of these tapes are, at best, troublesome for me. But on this day, and with this particular video, the trouble grew exponentially. My disorientation pushed me through the atmospheric haze of my limited perception into a world of entirely new and urgent possibility. Perhaps I was so freaked out by the whole situation that I simply broke through the cage my perception was roosting in. I learned to see the couple’s troubled relationship through another set of lenses—less clearly, more complexly.

I am always curious about the way that each member of the audience watches film footage on the screen through the eyes of the other people in the theater. The theater experience is not the same as watching something alone on your TV or computer. As human beings, we cannot help but monitor the way the others in a group are perceiving something. Are they laughing? Are they bored? Are they crying?

On this day, the rest of the room was filled with a large audience of young family therapists, social workers, and their mentor practitioners. Many were Muslim, many were women, some were Malay, others Indian, others Chinese; we were a mixed gathering. But I was the only western white woman in the room.

I tried to imagine what the room was seeing. I tried to imagine what I was seeing. The video was dark and scratchy, with the faces smeared to protect the confidentiality of the couple. Subtitles translated their conversation with their therapist into English at the bottom of the screen. But the subtitles did not translate the cultural frame in which the conversation itself existed. That is a craft no translator has yet managed.

I wondered if the women in the room were boiling with the injustice of the film. If so, I could not read it. Perhaps it would be impolite to reveal indignation with the therapist in attendance—the therapist whose work was being presented. I tried to watch the film in a wider view. I wondered if the audience was looking at techniques. Were they gathering know-how? Was this a moment for them to raise their observation to perceive in a new way? Would the issue of gender inequality be talked about within the frame of marriage? I wondered if it was even a safe platform for the participants to raise an emotive reaction.

Sex is not an easy topic. It is difficult to watch a film about someone else’s sex life in a public space. It was a brave choice to screen this clip. Is it possible to watch such a clip and not relate personally to it? I know, as professionals there is supposed to be a distance there, but is that distance real? Was there anyone in that theater who did not resonate with the clip on some level? Were there not many men who felt their needs were unmet? Were there not many women who felt they had been pushed, or manipulated into providing their bodies for their husband? Were there not people who had friends and family who joked and cried about these things?

The lights came on, and the panel began. We were: an Englishman, Hugh Palmer, who is a therapist specializing in systemic therapy; Takeshi, from Japan, also a therapist; Wen Tao, the therapist from Taiwan who screened the clip; Mai (the conference organizer), who is a Malay Muslim woman working in family therapy; and me.

I was asked to address the patterns. “Well,” I said, trying to sidestep the possibility of offending anyone in the room, especially the therapists I was sharing the stage with, “there were a number of double-binds in this session.” That was my opening for the panel, and while it was not a head-on invitation to discuss the difficulties of sex, marriage, rape, and communication, at least it was a beginning. The double-binds were everywhere. Traps of what can and cannot be spoken, traps of staying in the marriage, traps of divorcing. Traps of threatening divorce, traps of imagining a future together. On the positive side, it was obvious that if the couple were willing to speak about their sexual troubles in this way, they had a deep intention to heal the situation.

At first I spoke to that, and let the next person on the panel continue. I tried to wait and watch, wondering where the conversation would go. What will the men say? What will Mai say? What are the cultural boundaries I am within here?

As the other speakers contributed to the discussion, I glazed over. My attention turned to the audience before me. A sea of eyes, hearts, and minds, respectfully attending our presentations. The tilt here is different. Is the experience of sexuality and pain so different? Where is the human experience? Is there such a thing? What are the boundaries in therapy that define the self and professionalism? What are the professional boundaries around the therapist and the self of the therapist? And where are the cultural lines? Can we know? No.

I have my own personal story that in this case cannot go unmentioned. Into my observations of this interaction on the videotape I could not help but place my own version of the story. This is what we do in human communication, we share stories. The potency of story as medicine lies in the way many versions can be read into a narrative, and perhaps reread as well. A story is a representative adventure to play our own lives into. Sometimes, watching movies with my son when he was young he would declare, “I am Robin, not Batman. Who are you Mommy?” The story is our own, the characters are transferrable. In the video clip that was shown in Singapore, I was not the therapist. I was the wife who had been forced into having sex with her husband.

In real life, I was never forced into having sex with my husband. Let me be very clear about that. But, like so many women around the world, I have been raped. In my case it was no one who was familiar to me, but a taxi driver who pulled a gun on me in Hungary. It was decades ago now. But my cells still know the loss I experienced on that day. I am not going to compare my story to the wife in the film, because that would be a wild oversimplification. Still, it is hard to imagine what kind of apology that taxi driver could make to me that would change the way my body responds to the memory of him. And I have already discussed forgiveness (in ‘An Ecology of Hurt’). Luckily I never have to see that man again. Now I prefer to use public transportation.

As the panel spoke and reflections on the clip were shared, we drew to the end of the session. Wen Tao was last. Mai asked him if he could change anything about the session, what it would be? I was still mentally wandering around the minds of the audience, when I heard Wen Tao say that he thought the session went very well and that there was nothing he would change.

Something clicked. I realized our panel discussion was ending. We had not begun the real conversation yet. I was not sure what that conversation was going to be. It was unscripted, unprecedented. I looked at Mai, and at the other presenters, and then launched the rocket. I piped in:

“I want to share with you what I saw in this clip through my cultural lens.” I went on to say that from what I saw, it seemed like the wife was essentially raped and that it seemed to me there would be very little her husband could do or say to get her to return to a healthy sexual relationship with him. I questioned if it was ethical to ask her to do so. Additionally, I questioned the notion of his “needs” that were “not being met.” What kind of needs? Surely they could not be sexual needs because those would be better met by seduction and making himself more enticing to her, not force. So, were the ‘needs’ he had actually a need to dominate? In which case, if she was not interested in playing domination games, why on earth should she go back to that? Is it not true that sex is a conversation between two people, and that conversation is much richer with lovers who are both engaged and enjoying the experience? Who actually benefits from negotiating to get a reluctant partner to allow access to their resistant and limp body? Is that a healthy sex life? Not in my book. What about her ‘needs?’

This is the playback of the story in the clip through my filters. I knew I was speaking across cultural topographies. I took the risk that Wen Tao would be offended. I took the risk that the whole room would be offended. I tried to be as transparent as possible that the questions, the deductions I made public were only from my frame of reference. I put myself on trial. I was watching the room watch me watch the clip…

Me watching you watching me watching you. The interaction between cultures in today’s world are so many as to be untrackable. The mixing of messages through advertising, social media, movies, immigration, music and the financial markets has removed all possibility of ‘pure’ culture. We cannot expect ourselves to fully separate out one culture from another with any clarity. When we ask: ‘how has the idea of family therapy in the west with its techniques and analysis positioned practitioners in the east?’—can we expect to unravel the influences?

This moment marked a rare opportunity for a profound set of reflections to take place. The stakes were high, and fortunately the alchemy of the group was prepared.

The stories that room held took place in another set of expectations, another set of interactions that read differently. To this day I am not quite clear on what the version in the room was. As I tried to see the story through the eyes of the people around me, I could feel the chasm between our interpretations opening like a great canyon. The ground beneath all of us turned fluid. With many see-able stories surfacing in this one clip, the rigid boundaries of cultural assumption towered and crashed.

It is much easier to celebrate cultural differences when they are less acute. When we get to the topic of rape, the binary between right and wrong is a reduction of the real complexity. A binary lens renders the richness of the situation invisible. The scope of visible cultural complexity in the subject of rape funnels to a narrow line of legal and illegal, good and bad, right and wrong. Seeing other angles requires a kind of muscle of perception that can stretch to see through another window of life. What do you see me see? Can I see how narrow my own perspective is?

Wen Tao was ready to look through my window. After I described my seeing of the clip he said, “Until this moment I never saw the situation in that way.” He had been trying to protect the couple from divorce. In the clip he was trying to help the man stay in the marriage and not wander. He was doing everything he could to help the couple feel better about the life they were in. In the most honorable and dignified way, Wen Tao was helping the couple to heal. His version was so different from mine. Divorce would have meant another realm of pain, shame, and devastation to the family in ways that my math cannot calculate. I had not seen the situation the way he did. We both learned from publicly exchanging versions of our interpretations.

Through the many windows of multiple description, nothing is what it seems. Sex, marriage, age, divorce, money, death, love, success, honesty, respect—all of these fundamental human similarities are witnessed through the lens of culture. I cannot know the ins and outs of the similarities and differences of another culture, but I am fascinated by the paradoxes of identity within and between cultures. My interpretation of the clip was only one of many, and perhaps a damaging one. Wen Tao saw another version of the story. We were immeasurably lucky. We were a group of people with the tools to have a cross-cultural conversation; the tools of pattern, of knowing that our epistemological frames were limited. All of the presenters had traveled extensively and had worked in situations where misunderstandings, cultural or personal, have created both humor and horror. We were seasoned in the art of looking through other perspectives. We were ready to be humble, and most importantly, as Wen Tao showed, we were all willing to learn.

To see something, which you are sure can only be interpreted one way, being interpreted in another is a phenomenon that all of us need practice in. If you are right now questioning, “how can it ever be possible to see this situation as something other than rape?”—I will say that as I contemplated this situation and the quick villainizing and victimizing that my assessment of it led to, I began to think of my friends. Growing up female in the west was not exactly an experiment in female pleasure. My thoughts went out to all of the wives and girlfriends in my world, all properly indoctrinated in feminism, and conducting what they hope is a life of near equality with the people they call partners or husbands. But how many of them have felt pressured or manipulated into sex with their partners, at least a few times? Is our culture really so just and righteous that we can claim the moral high ground here? I think not. I know I have been in manipulative situations myself. There is no doubt that a large percentage of women have. There may be a statistic that runs the other way on the gender scale, and between same-sex couples as well. No matter the parties involved, the experience of having sex you do not really want is real and destructive.

Does that make every person who pressures and manipulates a rapist? Is every partner who receives that treatment a victim?

Consenting adults do not always want to consent, and the yes/no binary does not take into account the larger equations of home, family, finance, and reputation. These are complicated contingencies that bear upon consent in qualitatively transformative ways. Consent can be given with resentment, even hatred.

Is there one way that is better than another to perceive and analyze this story? Will one set of perceptions lead to a course of action that is more productive than another? I am not as sure as I might have been. What will hurt less? In western culture we have another form of support and acceptance for divorce, but it is still a disruptive upheaval to the family.

All I know for certain about this subject is personal. The juicy joy of loving another person in a physical conversation that is mutual and engaging for both parties, is a beautiful and healthy part of life. To shortchange that possibility with manipulation and force, in any culture, will deplete the avenues of contact and adoration between lovers. It would seem to me that in any part of the world, the capacity to love one’s partner to the fullest would only bring strength and resilience to the partnership. Why limit that?

To close, I return to the title of the conference, ‘Context.’ As a group of professionals, all steeped in the theory and practice of systems thinking, we were as prepared as anyone could be to address context. Culture is a context. This conference was a gathering of social care professionals and students; the context, as it were, was the health and wellbeing of families in Singapore. A marriage is a context. Our conversation in the big hall with the freezing cold air conditioning was a context. When contexts overlap, new contexts emerge, and in this case that new context was one in which to discuss context.

The truth is, we do not know how to hold such conversations yet, especially across cultures. Our blinders are not familiar enough to us to recognize when we have ‘not seen’ the limits of our perception—especially culturally. Earlier I posited the notion of a ‘healthy’ sexual relationship. But what is a healthy sex life? Is that not a cultural prescription? Or a religious one? Is there such a thing as a universal concept of healthy sex? What is the context in which we can begin to even ask that question? Perhaps gender, culture, personal preference, the legal system, medicine, psychotherapy, media, social theory, and who knows what else all frame and reframe this question to the point of impossibility.

What other conversation can we churn if we put the idea of sexuality, marriage, or even the idea of equality within the frame of religion and culture? Would it limit or would it clarify? Would it offer consolation or would we discover more boundaries? Are boundaries necessarily to be feared? Are they discernible?

What is a healthy sexual relationship? I pondered this and then wrote to Dr. Danielle Egan, an academic colleague of mine who specializes in sexuality. I asked her to give me a definition of what she would consider a healthy sexual interaction. Her response was this:

One where both individuals are able to explore their desires in a context where curiosity, discovery and respect is at a premium. It is more about the context within which the erotic happens rather than a particular form of the erotic.

Dr. Egan brought the subject to the context of the interaction between lovers. The context of the interaction is more than what is said, more than what is done, but rather the overtones and sensibility of the relationship. When we draw out the boundaries of their internal contexts, these lovers are inside a community that exists within a cultural context, which is inside a larger context of moral restrictions. Within all of these concentric circles we can begin to explore this idea, with “curiosity and respect at a premium.”

There is no list of do’s and don’ts in Egan’s definition. Instead she points to the tone of the context. The aesthetic of curiosity and respect leads to activities that fall within a spectrum that does not require external limits. However, flip that around and any activities without curiosity and respect will, by proxy, be hurtful. The relationship is in the context.

It is my hope that we can develop this important conversation so that it can continue across disciplines, religions, cultures, age groups, demographics and more—for the sake of a healthier world.

The trophy of this learning was the healthy confusion that came with the realization that there is more than one way to see something that at first appeared as ‘fact.’ The difference between this ‘confusion,’ and the ‘misunderstanding’ that preceded it, is the humility to learn, and to hold multiple truths in hand, even when they are paradoxical. When both sides think they are right, we get misunderstandings; when they see another possibility, we get the cognitive dissonance of mutual learning and the confusion it opens.

There are no bystanders. Every conversation counts. Everywhere.Whole Peace

Slam shut has a bit of stretch still,

Brittle with too many capitulations beforehand

This time I will not forsake myself

With the force of ten people I will stand

In integrity, and protection of my family

I will not forsake myself

Gentle was too subtle and taken

Without notice of the glass ribbon

I will not forsake myself,

On behalf of all women wilting

A stone not silent

Will not forsake itself

Misunderstood has a bit of hope still

Sad, with judgment everywhere

I will not forsake myself

Translating misconstrued intention

Is torture and it broke me

I will not forsake myself

Reaching always for depth

In an expanse of possible truths

I will not forsake myself

But in keeping, even crumbled

My path is growth

And I will not forsake myself

Up, out and over, has a bit of resolve still

Forgiveness a single puddle in a landscape

I will not forsake myself

Apology a reed at its bank

Peace has stones, has sorrow, has torn through the idea

That we look beyond each other’s weaknesses and asserts:

“Do not forsake yourself”

I stand with my gift, by the puddle on the hill with the reeds and the stones

And we are not separate

With the same strength I stand as ten

Again by you,

By not forsaking myself

I do not forsake you.The Fortune Teller

Call us the future from your past

—Fred Schneider, Founder, the B-52s

You pull the ‘death card’ from the tarot deck.

The ‘Love-Line’ on your palm is broken.

The tea leaves reveal a great pain is coming.

The prophet has seen doom.

Doom is imminent. The cards are dark.

In flickering candlelight a veiled seer might say to us:

“Beware for there is a future of great turmoil ahead, and many will not survive.”

When the fortune teller delivers an unwanted fortune, what is the best response? Can we stave off coming misfortune? Or is it fated?

To adjust the momentum and redirect the course is probably the only way to avoid the outcomes of this patterning. But to do so would require a shift in the overtone of how we make sense of this entire situation. Such an approach would have to abandon the scripted list of precautions that has previously acted as a distraction from the acknowledgement of a necessary shift in ecological context.

When we want to redirect our ill-drawn cards or diagnoses, we usually do so with the implicit hope of maintaining the status quo. Therein lies the sabotage of our efforts. What we know as ‘life’ is only known through living the way we are living. Our professions, our families, our homes, our food, habits, and holidays all define our lives. The curious logic that appears has something akin to a Möbius twist in it and begins to look like this: to avert doom we must preserve life which turns out to require a complicated set of ‘actions’ aimed at restoring or maintaining the very patterns that are currently propelling us toward our doom.

To be fair, the adjustments we make may help to defer the predicted ending, but more than likely they will not prevent it.

In the hopes of cheating destiny one might pursue all known ways to deflect, defer, and deter such a fate. This is a proactive and responsible approach. But, within the strategy of taking every precautionary measure to insure that the prophecy does not occur, there lies the likelihood of locking even deeper into the pathways that lead to it.

The causes of impending doom are systemic and therefore multiple. Like wads of wiggling threads, the many societal and epistemological narratives have become knotted into an ecology of their own over the course of centuries.

Both tarot cards and scientific laboratories are illustrations of the many creative capacities of humanity. Yet, when it comes to imagining how to maneuver into a multi-modal life-change, our capacity for imagination seems to dry up, even when the alternative is death. It is not just public officials who resist the idea of systemic reboot—most marriages require (and seek to avoid) similar evolutionary jumps over time, as do organizations, and by the clock of life on earth, even species, landscapes and entire ecosystems go through a complete overhaul. The structures that allow for survival are bound to be temporary. Evolution is what happens when patterns that used to define survival become deadly.

Will this multi-modal change destabilize and crash the existing system in question? Yes, probably. This is the cost of continuance at another level. The marriage will break; global economics will crash. But a new relationship might spring out of the old marriage, another valuation of life may emerge out of a crashed economy.

However, the security of not making those changes is a false security, and delivers deadly consequences. Using fewer petrochemical products will decrease the carbon emissions problem so that we can continue to use these products longer. Using communication techniques that denote respectful communication in relationships that are rotten does not change the nature of the disrespect, but allows the marriage to continue. False security is justified by incremental shifts that pick at one problem at a time in the name of prolonging stabilization.

Continuation of the patterns currently in place will lead to collapse, and will do so almost certainly. The idea that tomorrow must look almost just like today is apparently hard to shake. Plans get drawn up in important offices to address ‘problems’ and identify their ‘solutions.’ Steps are taken to provide security to the system: steps that take us deeper into the quagmire of protecting systems that have to be overhauled—all of them, all at once; steps toward fulfillment of the prophecy of doom.

It takes a great deal of change to keep things the same

In a world that is defined by constant change, significant effort is needed to hold any particular aspect of a system in a static pattern. Kids grow up, buildings disintegrate, seasons change, technology develops, viruses mutate, stones become sand. In any complex living system there are countless variables moving and changing in countless ways. This makes it hard to keep something—anything—inside this complexity from changing. To hold one part of a system still requires that all the relationships upon which this part is interdependent must alter to absorb the shifting. Every other interaction within the system must compensate for the lack of flexibility in one part. This strategy for maintaining security is temporary at best. It will not be long, in ecological time, before the larger patterns of the system overtake the attempt to keep sameness in place. The larger ecology of any system will continue. To walk across a restaurant holding a bowl of soup is to engage all the muscles and balancing processes of the body. Keeping the hot soup in the bowl, instead of sloshing it on the floor, becomes a full system task dependent upon the attention, balance, and maneuverings required to deliver the soup. Which physiological processes have to remain flexible to do this simple task? Which have to stabilize?

For some, the acceptance of doom is to fall off a cliff, an abandonment of possibility. For others the prophecy itself offers the opportunity to ‘set right’ those things that it is important to attend to before the end. Ironically, in preparing for departure the necessary actions are those which may well address the wad of wiggling threads of causation at another level. The peace made with old grudges, the planning of a will, finishing the abandoned manuscript, realizing unmet dreams, expressing uncommunicated affection and so on—these seemingly inconsequential actions represent a reweaving of the contextual patterns we live within. Significantly, movement of motivation alters the character or sensibility of the larger context. The bias, the tone, the posture of the logic within which we make sense of our decisions weaves a hidden weft of limits.

Preparing for a life that will come after death or divorce, or the fall of civilization, though perhaps pessimistic in tone, offers another sort of vista on resilience. This process activates another ecology of patterns.

If we reverse the view and imagine ourselves sometime after the apocalypse looking back at where we stand right now, will we still think that there was nothing we could do? Or will we see that we were blinded to the possibilities of what we might have changed? A pre-examination of how we might assess our failures once we can no longer change them stretches the imaginary limits of our current perspectives. To visualize the post-apocalyptic landscape of our remorse can shift the arcs of determination, change the tone, and assist our planning. The where, of where we are headed, shifts; the why, of why we are headed there, shifts; the when on the timeline of possibility moves; and the how becomes visible.

Using this kind of ‘pre-hindsight,’ different directions for our actions may become imperative, and for very different reasons than we might expect. Looking backward from the rubble of our mistakes we may see our current priorities from another angle. While this thought exercise may appear to embody a loss of hope, it is also likely that leapfrogging on the timeline of consequences may provoke a kind of thinking we do not otherwise have access to.

Right now, for example, it seems possible to think only in terms of incremental additions and subtractions to policy that would provide steps toward a more harmonious ecological economy. The guiding assumption is that life as we know it, and as it shapes our infrastructure (both societal and epistemological), is not capable of accommodating the upheaval of its premises. Instead of interrupting our day-to-day political and economic system, we imagine that we would be interrupting the whole ecology of our biosphere and violently brewing a future of distrust between nations, between generations, and between religions. So, for example, our strategy thus far has been not to disrupt the many stabilizing interdependencies that permit the continuation of the web of industries that generate distrust and exploitation. These characteristics of our world appear to be immutable. But from the other side of the devastation, when we are looking back at the trauma, the loss in nature, and the gaping wounds in our notion of what humanity is—will we still feel we could not have interrupted the industries of war, or the economies of exploitation?

Why is it that short-term thinking is deadly, and long-term plans are also often disastrous? My father wrote about what he called “conscious purpose” as being a habit that should be regarded with suspicion. The capacity to see across epochs of ecological and geological narrative is not something that any expert can claim. Actions that appear at first to be benevolent often turn out to be destructive. “The road to hell,” as the old proverb says, “is paved with good intentions.” The changes visible in a human lifetime of 70-90 years are significant in comparison to the brief hours of a mayfly’s life, but sequoia redwood trees have much longer clocks. The human attempt to perceive the larger narratives of nature cannot take into account the complexity of co-evolution. Plans get derailed by the fact they do not include the larger circuits of life. My father writes:

If you use DDT to kill insects, you may succeed in reducing the insect population so far that the insectivores will starve. You will then have to use more DDT than before to kill the insects which the birds no longer eat. More probably, you will kill off the birds in the first round when they eat the poisoned insects. If the DDT kills off the dogs, you will have to have more police to keep down the burglars. The burglars will become better armed and more cunning… and so on. That is the sort of world we live in—a world of circuit structures…

—Gregory Bateson, Steps to an Ecology of Mind

What is the road back from hell paved with? Another version of hope.

The dark side of the prophecy offers a foundation from which to imagine a context after the worst has befallen. The ground is moved. The thinking that can take place from that point on the timeline runs backward through the hoops of causation and re-groves the premises of change. If we ask how to continue after a system has self-destructed (rather than how to make change in an existing system) we shift from prevention to starting again.

In the process of imagining what we would do differently if we had to start over there is a good likelihood that we will envision beyond the barriers of what is ‘possible’ to change from inside the perspective and mindset of our existing systems. Long-term planning from present to future is likely not to account for the possibility that the system will explode along the way. But to set a course that begins after that explosion is to leave behind the baggage of impossibilities that currently bog down and misguide our trajectory to change.

The presumption of linearity in these matters is an illusion. Then is now and now is then. The future we project into our planning processes is just as unreal as the past we can project into our reconstruction plans. Apocalypse is a linear idea, and we do not live in a linear world. Complexity reaches in more directions than we might authorize in the boardroom.

Assuming that we will soon be long gone, that our social economic systems destroy our world as we know it, what can we tell those who continue after us about the mistakes we made? What would we like them to remember about us? How do we suggest they avoid the pitfalls that we could not? Framing the questions in this way we set new patterns into play.

But…what if there is no longer such a thing as national politics? While I commend and cheer those ardent souls who stand bravely (I hope) in the political arena and hold the dream there, I think we need another position from which to shift the compass, besides elections.

What if there is no ‘left’ and ‘right’ but rather a split between big corporate interests and those of the living organisms (like humanity, nature)? What if what we are seeing is really a global business divide? Then what? The BLOB (Business Looming Outside Borders) is actually not democratic; it is a profit model (and one that favors oil, guns, limiting human rights, limiting immigration in times of climate change, cutting education funds, medical care, robbing the social piggy bank, ecological abuse, and wars).

Maybe the role of politics has been redefined from ‘the pursuit of happiness’ to implementation of the will of the hungry ghost in societies around the globe. That is a far cry from ‘we the people.’ Today the US is reshuffling the poker deck, but this is not about America; we are witnessing the selling-off of humanity and nature—and it is everywhere: Ukraine, France, Sweden, Canada, Hungary, Germany, the UK, Ireland, China… everywhere.

How can nations address global issues when policy is national? Do we need a new entry point? What should be considered instead of the existing structures of democracy?

The practice of stance not strategy is next. While the tendency is to contemplate replacement forms of order, it may be more appropriate now to consider how to prepare to be in chaos more creatively. Re-visioning order is pre-emptive, and in a sense off-topic. Systems as we know them are in transformation. Ecological, economic, political, and cultural diagrams are washing off the page. Like martial arts masters, to be in this transformation calls for increasing sensitivity and responsiveness within the momentum and chaos of this era. So the question now is not ‘what is better than democracy?’ but ‘how can epistemological frames adjust to everything we know as normal melting into new opportunities to be better humans?’Fools See Outlines

The group think could shrink

cultures into vultures.

Pickled and preserved in nostalgia for a time that

never was.

Outlines? I doubt mine.

Ink seeping and creeping.

A hash of a hundred myselves sussing:

all and none ever was.

But identity is no entity

projected and reflected

Its stewing a broth of what humanity could be,

Claiming an un-naming

Is complexly perplexing

when my future me is serving up all I ever never was.Practicality in Complexity

The subtle poetry of leaves on sand after the rain is a nearly unseen messenger.

A message of wabi-sabi gestures reads: life is elegant, by accident.

Grace is the default.

How can we use knowledge of complexity in a practical way? I am often asked this question. I am confused by it. Practical at what level? Does ‘practical’ mean:

… to offer quick but un-systemic solutions?

… or to offer better understanding of the complexity of the context?

Executive decisions define our lives, and evidence-based research with deliverables is required to back those decisions up. In this era, substantive demarcations of what makes an effort worth the time and money should be provided at the outset of any program. Consequently, we see, in workshops, lectures, conferences, and universities, an insatiable appetite for prêt-à-porter improvement programs. There is always the next new 5-or 7-step program ready to be sold with the promise of improvement for individuals, organizations, and ministries. I want to pull my hair out when I see these books and seminars touting their promises. The price of short cuts is consequences and their echoes.

I cannot offer any such program. It would be hypocrisy for me to do so. My whole life is centered around advocating for the delicate interdependencies of life. As a result, my work is sometimes seen as ethereal, my students are frustrated because the only ‘given’ is change. Life is mutual learning. Life shifts, systems are in flux, for better and for worse. The unspeakable beauty of those interdependencies exactly matches the horror. The beauty lies in the ever-forming symmetries and asymmetries that evolve into unimaginable grace, and the horror in the sense that there is so much uncertainty and so little control.

I won’t likely stand down from my advocacy of this messy interaction with life. It is not just a method of making decisions—it is an aesthetic. There is no hard evidence to back up the statistical efficiency of an aesthetic. But that does not mean that there is nothing practical in the material I offer.

In defense of a world that is characterized by mutual learning between variables in a given context—a world that does not stay the same, a world that won’t be mechanized or modeled—in defense of that world, I maintain that nothing could be more practical than to become more familiar with the patterns of movement that life requires. The goal is not to crack the code, but rather to catch the rhythm.

The world is complex, and the complexity is not manageable in a predictable, strategic plan. Looking around the globe I think it is permissible to make the sweeping statement that our attempts at control, no matter how often they have been verified by quantitative methods, are not working. Where does that leave us?

If you do not know what the terrain of a marathon is, you had better be prepared for anything. Most importantly, be prepared to make spontaneous decisions based on an assessment of the context at the time. Long preparations for a run across the desert will not be useful in the event of urban snowstorm conditions. In this era of complexity, we do not know what is coming, and I believe it is both impractical and potentially unethical to pretend we do.

Why is it that a discussion of life in which these many relational, moving, learning variables are brought into the description is considered abstract, while the description that isolates, fragments, objectifies the parts of a system is considered practical? Should it not be the other way around? Is it not an abstraction to pull a person, idea, or organism from the contextual relationships of family, food, culture, feelings, ecology and so on and label them? Is it not more abstract to take a piece of the living world and try to make sense of it without all of the contextual, contributing aspects of its vitality? Can we really understand anything without context?

So, the point, the deliverable, the practicality of my work is not to offer concrete solutions, or stepped improvement plans. It is to offer an invitation in to a world that does not sit still, and encourage an increase in sensitivity to the complexity in all of its glory and gore. My work is premised on the idea of mutual learning between and within living contexts. This learning does not stop. It is not always progressive, or good: sometimes learning to be in a context includes addiction, pathology, and so on. We cannot control mutual learning; we cannot solve it. But, we can become more able to take in and consider the complexity we are faced with if we approach it from this stance.

The quandary I often hear is that complexity takes too long, and it is impossible to ever understand all of the infinite interrelationships. How do we use it? Both as individuals and as professionals we have to make choices and take action in the moment of life; we can’t sit around and contemplate these ‘abstractions’ of swirling variables forever. It is true; it takes longer to consider complexity. It is true also that we will never understand all of the infinite interrelationships. ‘Can we afford the time and effort to try?’ is a good question. My only response is: ‘Can we afford not to?’

The unpredictable continues into the consequences of decisions made with the idea of static systems in mind. The strategy of isolating information does not extend into the system once we have chosen ‘action.’ Whatever those plans beget becomes part of the complexity that continues from then on. The interrelations creep back in, the interdependencies overlap and overtake the clear, simple, ‘practical’ plan. The larger ecology of the situation always drowns fragmented attempts to control it. Unfortunately, it does so with unwieldy difficulty and reactions to reactions that we cannot undo. Example: Read the headlines of any paper and the iterations of reactions are there to be seen. But, this is only possible if you look with eyes that search for continuum; if you are looking for linear stories with beginnings, middles, and endings, that is what you will find. In which case, you won’t be able to see the ways in which these patterns are overlapping. You will not have access to the deeper alchemy.

We cannot know the systems, but we can know more. We cannot perfect the systems, but we can do better. The evolution of our own ability to understand and interact with the world around us is an increase in our ability to be sensitive to information we have previously been blind to. That is learning to learn.

At the edges of the given patterns, there are liminal zones. The boundaries. This is where interaction takes place. These are the places where the directions of potential pathways as yet uncharted live. An example of this might be the medical system in the US, which at present is so entangled with the insurance industry that the system is in a holding pattern. What is the relationship between this bind and the development of alternative medicine in the subculture? Will those that cannot afford insurance find ways to steal from other the parts of the system so they can pay for basic medical attention? Or both? Entire industries are developing in the margins of this conundrum. Where will they go? How might the politicians in Washington, DC approach their decision-making differently given greater sensitivity to the consequences and consequences of consequences within the entire social construct?

These questions do not have answers. They are avenues where inquiry is invited. With luck the inquiry will lead to further inquiry. A good question leads to better questions. A simple question gets a simple answer, and we do not live in a simple world.

I maintain, at the risk of being called abstract, that the possibility of an increase in our ability to receive nuanced information about the interactions in a complex system exists. This is my optimism. This is where I place hope for the coming eras. We need that sensitivity to live better lives. This is the sensitivity that will allow us to understand our spouses better, to raise our children better, to grow food better, study life better, and organize our world better. It will also make us into artists. I maintain that nothing could be more practical.Sound of Sun

William Bateson said, “Treasure your exceptions.” In unseen banal moments, a visiting unreasonable notion can come along and unwrite the limits of our thinking. Such wonders wait with the infinitude of what we never saw in the margins of our sensibleness. When asked how smell moves, a group of 5-year-olds came up with a theory that they built a whole world around—deciding that ghosts pull smells on strings you cannot see.

Tiny dreaming grass sprouts tenderness between languages.

The sunlight in waves might be audible to the plants. Do the ferns know the creek has stopped running? The sound waves are not tickling their delicate hair. Drought is coming. Stay small.

When ancient and modern vocabularies in multiple mother-tongues weave together, they form ambiguities. These composites are, for me, as close as anyone can come to speaking truth.

Play with the edges.

![[p137-01.jpg]]What Do You See When You Look at Her Face? How Is She Feeling Now?

Right now, not later, is the time to begin to find a way to confront racism and bigotry when they occur in public. Hundreds of years of abhorrent behavior do not justify another minute of it. Enforced governmental equality mandates and laws would be helpful, but until then, on a person to person basis—in our everyday lives, every single incident of bigotry needs to be fished out of the pool of human interaction like so many turds.

Yesterday, I was on the subway in Stockholm when a Muslim woman sat down next to an old woman of white skin tones. The latter hesitated, looked the Muslim woman over and then moved to a seat in the next subway car. From where I sat I saw the Muslim woman watch the elderly woman move to another seat. The politics of the airwaves became intensely personal.

I agree that rapid cultural integration is not easy. Over the last several years Sweden has taken in more refugees than most countries around the world and is collectively struggling to find balance. And, as these refugees are moved into communities that have been largely culturally homogenous there is bound to be friction. But the friction is being frothed up and presented as another political opinion. For some reason I cannot fathom, the press has given time and voice to the irresponsible drama of people who are making public statements of racism. This climate of hate that is being brewed is going to increase this sort of incident, as well as much more volatile ones. This is dangerous.

As I watched this insult unfold on the subway that day, I found that I did not know what to say or do. I know in my bones that I should have done something, but I do not know what. I wonder how many times a day on this train this scenario is repeated. How many more people will face this shame today?

The humiliation that the Muslim woman had been subjected to was appalling. I cannot put words to her experience, but for my part, I know that even though I was screaming on the inside, I hesitated to speak out. Racism is nothing new, but something else is brewing now, something sinister and dangerous. I always wondered how it could have possibly happened that the people of Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s could have allowed the escalation of public sentiment that became the concentration camps. In my naiveté I assumed that world had learned a lesson. I thought the history of Nazism would always stand out as one of the most shameful depictions of humanity. But here we are, in 2016, watching public expression of racism build into right-wing movements that disavow the suffering millions who wait to be allowed to enter the countries that can help. I have never understood how those in office turned away the boats of Jews seeking refuge from the Nazis. Their excuses are inexcusable. As I reflect now on this incident on the train I see warning signs of that time.

I was silent. I know I should not have been. I am writing now to abate that silence. Why did I not speak up? I am not sure. There were many contexts of silence that seemed to swallow my words. I was held back by the suspicion that any sort of public confrontation might further put the Muslim woman in the hot seat. I did not want to add to the suffering that was already under way. What I wanted to do was to scream out in disgust at the behavior of the older white woman, and of the entire population of spite-spewing, bigoted ignoramuses. But I wanted to do so without making it worse for the Muslim woman who was already humiliated.

What can be said or done that will be effective in these situations as they arrive day-to-day, subway-by-subway, and scene-by-scene?

I could have gone to sit by her. But again, that would have highlighted the horror of the moment in a way that the quiet tension did not. It felt like a courtesy to allow a little silent dignity so she could just go wherever she was going without public invasion. I suppose it would have been better to have confronted the old woman. She was the perpetrator of this disgusting behavior. But what could I have said?

Should I have accused her of being a racist? Of being rude? I am quite certain that she would have said she had some other reason for moving, and denied any wrongdoing. She had not said anything when she decided to switch seats, she just moved. There was nothing to ‘call her out on.’ Creating public confrontation is risky.

There seem to be layers of unseen, unspoken, and unbreakable protocols around causing a public scene. There is a thick wall of shame around all who would sacrifice the peace of a shared moment with strangers for the sake of making a stand politically. I have never seen anyone in an informal situation effectively address someone who has made a statement (physical or verbal) of homophobia, racism, misogyny, verbal abuse, or other cross-cultural bigotry. I have occasionally seen fierce polarity flare up that resulted in escalating the conflict. But mostly I have seen ‘bystanders’ say nothing at all.

Granted, there are personal stories in all directions that need telling. But these stories are not broachable in the 30-second window one has to address them on a moving train. The old woman on that train who changed seats has developed her world view through many threads of her life over decades. Media, religion, and political discourse have framed her inside an ideology and history that incident merely illustrates. Likewise, the complexity of the layers of reasoning behind the silence of the other people on the train is patterned into the depths of the invisible rules of social behavior. Respect for the elderly, not upsetting the silence of the train, not embarrassing the Muslim woman, not inciting a group conflict in the event that others in the shared space take sides—there are thick blocks everywhere, and no authorization for sidestepping them.

I have seen passengers on trains publicly scold other passengers for putting their feet on the seats. But when it comes to scolding for racism there is a veil of silence. How can the spell be broken?

In the flash of public exchange on a train, there was not time to truly meet this complexity. But, perhaps time is not what is actually needed. With more time it is possible that the situation could be analyzed and dissected from several directions. While that process may be informative, the double bind remains. The task here is to find a way, in relatively little time, to take the interaction up a level. Above the density of the interwoven reasons for not addressing the wrongness in our public sphere is another realm, where the way we approach the situation is free of these shackles. The task is to normalize the interaction in which busting someone for bigotry in public is as expected as it would be for any other form of public destruction.

I don’t want to live in a world where people are horrible. I don’t want to contribute in any way to that horror. As it is, just by living my life I am enmeshed in the web of capitalistic exploitation that ties to countless crimes against humanity and nature. Even my phone is a testament to my ability to overlook the hideous labor practices, international trade injustices, rare earth depletion, and advertising propaganda… I am far from innocent in this world of violent inequity. Let me be quite clear that the hubris of colonization, and all that the industrial world has wrought on the globe, is visible in my living room. In that sense I am not a better person than the old woman on the train. In a sense, I have no right to say anything at all. Simultaneously I have every responsibility to do everything I possibly can to address and heal the pain that history has left for us.

I know that saying nothing is not an option. What future lies in that direction? I did not know what to say to the old woman and feel the need to practice an approach that I have never seen. I am running scripts through my mind today of all the things I could have said. Because to do nothing is so deeply wrong. Next time I want to know what to do. On the train, at the store, in the bar, with my family and friends—no more of these little transgressions that suggest the normality of disrespect can be brushed over. There is no room for discretely condoning these moments with hesitation.

How shall we break through the hidden veils that silence the witnesses? Sadly, I believe that in the coming months and years there will only be more situations like the one I witnessed on the train. Societies are dividing. Europe, Canada, and the US are all sprouting right-wing groups.

If the old woman had dropped her wallet I would not have hesitated to break the silence. I might have said, “Excuse me, you dropped your wallet.” And given it back to her. If I had seen a pickpocket pulling cash out of her purse I would not have hesitated to defend her. If she had asked me for directions or assistance with her bags I would have gladly offered. In the same spirit, should I have said, “Excuse me, you dropped your human decency.”

But that would have been sassy. And it would have created a scene. I did not want to respond in anger.

On the other hand, what she did also created a scene, non-verbally.

The scriptable interactions for what to do in this situation are filled with traps. For that reason, it’s important to have this conversation with our children, our parents, our professional colleagues and our friends. Break the spell.

Tolerance of intolerance is not going to do much good. And, direct polarization with polarized groups will increase the dividing rhetoric. Shaming the old woman probably would have increased her conviction that her world is threatened by foreigners. The privilege she presumed she had was evident in her obvious expectation that she could behave in that way and NOT be scolded.

Perhaps I should have gone and sat down with her and tried to describe the pain her actions unleashed into the world. I could have explained the consequences of consequences that future generations will have to live in from little gestures of hate like hers. I might tell her that by shunning the Muslim woman she has contributed to the next generation’s aggressiveness. I might also tell her that by behaving that way in public she brought all of us on the train into this story. Perhaps she does not have the right to privacy after doing something like that in a public space.

Racism and bigotry are not opinions that preferred groups can be granted authorization to have. Choosing not to sit next to a Muslim woman is not like choosing not to eat meat, or choosing one flavor of economic development over another. Anyone who believes that the lives of one group of people are worth less than another brings danger and destruction to their community. They are not a joke, or sometimes ok, or dismissible because the woman was old… When uncle so and so says something derogatory at a family gathering about the refugees, or immigrants, or women or… he has effectively crawled onto the dining table of the family history and defecated on it. But more often than not those comments slide by. Each time they grow a little more ugly.

I now wish I had asked the old woman: “Can you see the pain in the woman’s face that you just humiliated? What do you think she is feeling?”

Numbness is an epidemic. The lack of sensitivity to these seemingly inconsequential moments is deadening the ability to feel pain when we should. Pain that will grow between generations, races, and religious groups and act as the paintbrush of blood for the future. The discomfort and confusion I feel now is necessary. It is due. More is due. I got angry at the old woman, at myself, at the politicians and publications that have seeded this lack of decency in the public sphere. My anger is not the kind to soothe away; it is the anger that holds in its fist the tenderness to want other people to be treated with respect. It is an anger whose fire burns away numbness.Stop That Thing You Do

I am baffled by our habit of issuing endless ‘direct correctives’ to our children, ecology, and economy…. We must re-think the notion of fixing things.

Diffused adjustments are more effective in complex systems. Indirect is much more effective, though impossible to prescribe. Banking on the order of life to justify a notion of what is correct overlooks necessary chaos.

My thoughts are of the snow on the branches that make beautiful, jagged zebra stripes on the horizon in winter…Symmetry and asymmetry are convivial.

The paradox of order and chaos in simultaneous improvisation is such a challenge to hold in focus. But in that balancing (for it is surely in infinite process and never totally balanced), in that conversation, in that music, the new enters the patterns.Ecology of Love

Ecology is a love story.

A play scripted between the sunlight’s tender dappling on the forest floor,

The elegant drapery of the vines that climb a cliff face,

The tickle of the squirrels and birds

Holding society in the tree tops

And the sultry sway of the purple kelp the otters cannot resist.

The touch of life on life met in the tension

Between unshaking trust and heartbreaking vulnerability

Is a kiss of light and love and heat

And earth.

It is fierce and sweet

And rages with the same passion.

It births a wild rose.

And in naming you

I grasp and find there are no completions,

Nothing in straight lines

Only affection,

Reaching,

Reading the gestures

That spread everywhere.

(This is the transcript from a short film I made, by the same name)Parts & Wholes, Hope & Horror

If we inquire what does constitute a nation, we soon find that neither common racial origin, nor identity of language, or of religion, or of manners is essential. The most acceptable definition is probably that which declares that people compose a nation when they feel themselves to be a nation. But if we inquire how they come to share this feeling which has no necessary dependence on genetic relationship, on collocation in space, on common language, or common customs or beliefs, the answer is by no means obvious. National sentiment… is the power of those whom we call patriots, to give them their more noble title, thus to polarize the peoples. In their wake follow the journalist, the contractor and the manufacturer of armaments. The scene is set. Catch-words are chosen, insults bandied and the play begins.

—William Bateson, 1918 address on ‘Science and Nationality’

There may be a blind spot in the way we make sense of the world that is holding back our ability to make the shifts necessary for human survival. It is possible that this could be the implicit assumption that the world is made of parts and wholes geared together to resemble a giant machine. Has this schematic blueprint been projected onto our understanding of nature and culture? Are there clear defining lines between parts and wholes, nations and individuals, organisms and ecosystems?

Obviously a family is not a machine any more than a forest is; still there is a presumption that each part of either of those systems has a role in how the larger system functions. I want to show that the influence of the machine metaphor can be seen throughout our world, a world in which we see a global return to pre-WWII levels of nationalism, coupled with declining ecological systems, and the apparent inability of presiding experts to swerve our social and scientific realms into system change. I have become suspicious in recent years of the violence that indirectly results from this machine-dream. Of course, 21st-century science has compiled a portrait of life that is much more complex than an ordinary machine, but I would argue that, if one looks deep enough, the imprint of this mechanistic metaphor is still there.

The benefits of studying the ‘workings’ of life according to the logic of machinery have been substantial, but there is a conceptual problem. If each part of the ecosystem is particularly purposed into its place in the larger biosphere, how does evolution happen? Increasingly the study of environmental context, which we see for example in the rediscovery of epigenetics, has upended the more linear evolutionary narrative. It turns out that context matters, and that organisms learn together. From a social perspective that same question can be reframed: if each culture has something intrinsically set that it brings to the global family, how do we account for the constant transference of customs, lands, and languages, and the emergence of new ideas?

I have dedicated my life to researching contextual mutual learning, along with my partners at the International Bateson Institute, in the hope of illustrating a different premise upon which life is operating.

In recent years, there has been some movement toward holistic studies and ‘interdisciplinarity’ has become a catchword in academic institutions, where programs have been installed to transcend the division of learning into isolated subject silos. However, these separations between subjects are not in themselves the problem. The silos are a product of our perception of how life is organized. Beyond the fragmentation and de-contextualization apparent in the many separated disciplines and departments, there lies the underlying problem inherent in dividing up life.

Why does it make sense to divide the world into abstracted pieces? Why does the child take apart a watch? To see how it works, that is the argument. A watch however, has a mechanism that, unlike a living system, does not require a context of living, learning, changing relationships. Working watches are stabilized in their functioning. Life is not stable; without evolution there is only extinction. Yet, even within the holistic discourse of cybernetics and systems theory, the whole system, be it ecological, technical or social, has often been presumed to be a composite of parts. The upshot is that, as with the watch, in order to study any given system, divisions within it have to be made, delineating the various ‘parts’ that would come together to make the whole.

In this approach, parts and wholes are held to be real and separate from the efforts of the observer or analyst. Our way of seeing and perceiving is conditioned by the system we are seeing and perceiving. It is tricky and probably futile to try to describe this phenomenon, especially using the same prose though which it is formed. Function, seen through this lens, is dependent on having just the right parts, with just the right organization.

Early systems and cybernetics work was at the forefront of bringing revolutionary holistic studies to western science. These studies have always been marginalized, and are only recently coming into favor. While I am excited to see this new popularity of systems and interdisciplinary studies, I am also concerned that they can be used in ways that the founders of this thinking never intended. I fear the consequences, the substantial and deadly miscalculations that the ways we define parts and wholes have led to. The Achilles heel that I see even in some systems theories is the holdover of a metaphor that describes the rigging of life as a functional set of processes—even though these theories do this in a more complex way than many studies without interdisciplinarity in their favor. I would like to see the possibilities that would be available to our studies if we were to start with the assumption of contextual mutual learning.

It matters a great deal what image underpins our research. The findings and the analysis will be framed in the same logic as that initial assumption. I have two stories that illustrate how I have come to this question and why. One is a story of horror and the other is of hope.

A Story of Hope

In 2013 I took a trip to the Library of Congress with a few colleagues. We discovered correspondence in the Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson files that illuminated the beginning of ‘systems thinking’ as we know it today. In the letters, a collective of intellectuals in the late 1930s correspond as professional colleagues and friends, and express their fight against fascism as they saw Hitler gaining momentum and eugenics catching the imagination of the scientific world. Through a new glimpse into the inception of these ideas I saw not only the acumen that this early group embodied, but perhaps more importantly their care for the future of humanity and the biosphere.

Their idea was to address the epistemology that made fascism possible. They were disturbed by the threat of fascism as it was developing in Europe and around the world and saw science as giving traction to the foothold that fascism was gaining at that time. In their letters they describe the fragmentation and fractioning of knowledge as contributing to the kind of thinking which could allow fascism to take root. They maintained that if the world could be divided up, it would be. Having been divided, those divisions would gain political, military, and ideological strength.

To address this, they discussed the possibility of developing a new science that would offer a way to study the world through all of the other sciences simultaneously. These scholars wanted to study how culture, biology, and ideas were interconnected. They were the core of what would become the Macy Conference group twenty years later. The science that they would later develop was cybernetics.

(Cybernetics is not easily definable, but using the words of Wikipedia, let’s call it “a transdisciplinary approach for exploring regulatory systems, their structures, constraints, and possibilities.”)

I was moved by the passion and emotional concern in these letters for how the world was being torn apart during WWII. This group was driven to do what they could to stop the physical and cultural violence of fascism. The tendency toward separation of disciplines in natural and social sciences was seen as the epistemological scaffolding within which separations between peoples, ideas, and nature would be logical and reasonable.

Gregory, Margaret and others were already posing questions that reached toward finding out what in our cultures had been cultivated that would beget the collective human trend towards such terrifying, blind disregard for life as they were seeing in Germany (and elsewhere) at that time. In their dedication to their cause they expressed their heartfelt fears for what would happen if fascism took hold of the collective imagination of the western world. They imagined the damage would likely be complete. They predicted that the trauma of future generations would surface in unrecognizable hatred, humiliation, and exploitation. Humanity’s integrity was in the balance. Life itself was in the balance. They cared.

The letters we found that day at the Library of Congress predate the Macy Conferences in which Cybernetics was first defined. The history of how and why this group came to be is essential to our understanding today of the material they developed. It is all too easy to think that the great minds that gave us cybernetics did so out of intellectual rigor—which they did. But, they were also motivated to do so by the obligation they felt as thinking, feeling, human beings to address the threat of ecological destruction, generations of future trauma, cultural pain, and species depletion that they perceived would be the result of procuring knowledge in divided compartmental ways, i.e. dividing the world into bits. They wanted to find a way to study life in its wholeness as a kind a vaccination against fragmentation. Those letters were written 80 years ago.

A Story of Horror

Also in 2013, I was asked to do a radio interview after the release of the film I made about my father, ‘An Ecology of Mind.’ New films generate press, and I was doing interviews to promote the film with some frequency at that time. What was unusual was that I took the time to vet this request. I am not sure what prompted me to be more careful, but something did. The interviewer wanted to discuss my father’s ideas of ecology and culture. I was not surprised by that. He went on to say how important it is to have these discussions of ecology and culture in an era where so much diversity was being lost. I agreed with that too. But, I began to smell something fishy. He made a remark about racial intermarriage that I could not quite place in the rest of conversation, and then something else about immigration. I chalked my confusion up to a bad Skype connection. I looked up his name on the Internet and found his organization. The request turned out to be from a right-wing group of neo-Nazis concerned about the imminent genocide of so-called native Europeans (i.e. white people).

I did not see that coming.

It would be a few more years before huge waves of immigrating refugees would take center stage in our press stories. Immigration was not so much in the news then, especially not in Europe. Speaking from my desk in Vancouver, Canada to this polite man on Skype who wanted an interview, I had no idea what he was trying to say. With hindsight I notice with amazement how difficult it is to see something you have never seen before. I simply could not imagine that he was approaching me for an interview to assist in justifying his vision of a divided world. Me? Gregory’s work? Systems? Anthropology?

At that time, I did not yet recognize the velocity of the emergence of these right-wing groups as a global phenomenon. The Tea Party was in full swing in the US, but truthfully in my eyes it was so full of idiotic rhetoric and buffoon-like characters that, like many other people, I did not take it very seriously. This request marked the first time it truly dawned on me that the threat of these extreme right-wingers might actually be a substantial danger, let alone an intellectual challenge. Snobbery is what I was guilty of, and my come-uppance was harsh.

On the website for this particular group there was almost none of what I would have expected as predictable racist material. Instead, the content was all derived from highly sophisticated, systems-informed anthropology, philosophy, ecology, and social justice activism sources. To my horror, it was in the name of cultural preservation, and the need for every culture to provide a knowledge base in the ecology of ideas, that the imagined loss of a so-called indigenous European place in the social ecology could be seen as an ecological tragedy. In the spirit of protecting biodiversity the site raged that what it called injustice needed to be addressed in order to restore European cultural purity. The website suggested that inter-marriage should be stopped between indigenous Europeans and others to save the remaining authenticity of the culture, and that immigration should be stopped. I found it staggering to see so many ideas I thought were ethical, intelligent, and beautiful put toward this ugly neo-Nazi agenda. Though I have since found that this hijacking of ecological thinking by white racists is well known in some circles, for me this was personal because the tenets of systems thinking were also being co-opted.

On the website the bloggers were referring to my father’s ideas, to Margaret Mead, and to other ecologists and systems thinking icons. I had to take time, step back, reconsider touting systems thinking as a way to save the planet—and begin a quest to find out how this could happen. I needed to develop or contextualize systems ideas differently, in hopes of creating a way to get to another level of thinking where this kind of divisiveness would be precluded. There was an oversight somewhere, and I began a hunt to find it.

I knew I had made two mistakes. First of all, I overestimated the water-tightness of systems thinking. For me it was a foregone conclusion that my father’s work, and the work of his contemporaries since the beginning of cybernetics, would eliminate ideas that could house racist polarities like the ones I was seeing. Secondly, I underestimated the refinement and complexity of the rhetoric that the extreme right was using. Somehow I expected that only a narrow-minded, bigoted reductionism could hold such destructive binaries. On both of these counts I was mistaken.

I declined the interview, realizing that anything I said would likely be taken out of context. Instead, I have put myself to the task of finding the blind spot within the work that that my father and his contemporaries set into motion. Ironically, or perhaps fittingly, I do so for the same reasons that this work was begun in the 1930s.

Systems, Ecology and Fascism

As the decades have gone by, the tenets of cybernetics have seeded the fields of systems theory, complexity theory, and chaos theory as well as so much else in the world today, including psychotherapy, engineering, ecology, information science, and communication theory. Understanding and decoding life’s ‘order’ is at the core of all of these traditions of knowledge. Now, I would argue, is a critical moment in the evolution of thinking about this ‘order.’ Is it a multi-perspective learning process? Or is it definable in terms of its parts and wholes?

I am beginning to see a sickening similarity between the ecologists’ description of the earth’s systems interacting, and the neo-Nazi description of why purity of culture is necessary. The irony of this observation is that the extreme right and left share a worldview—though their intentions are entirely different. Both are founded on the idea that the world is made of parts and wholes that should remain intact in order to keep the social or environmental system functioning. The cogs must not be disrupted if the system is to continue and not become obsolete. In both cases the processes of evolution, co-evolution, and learning are confined to the impossibility of static forms interacting with static forms.

Saving Systems Science

Since my discovery of the neo-Nazi website and the way in which these ideas were being used to promote the very sorts of thinking they were meant to deter, I have been concerned that decades of systems work could be lost. If the vocabulary of systems gets hijacked by the extreme right, it will be difficult to get it back, or it could be impossible to replace. Given the rate at which the coherence of our economic, social, and ecological systems is declining, there is no time for a reboot of the last 50 years of important work. The depth of thinking, the naming of patterns, the criteria of the systemic approach to thinking about life are, I am convinced, absolutely vital for our decisions in coming years. The loss of the use of these tools of thought would be a disaster. It is in this spirit that I am seeking to find where the blind spots are in this work, and how we might begin a discussion on attending to the oversights that have led to this emergency.

At the core of systems work is a search not just for details, but for patterns. This is not an easy task within the epistemological limits of western culture, where the habit of applying notions of cause and effect has been rewarded over several centuries of cultural, technological, and theological development. Systems thinking requires us to see past those old scripts and into the world of interrelations. To think in terms of systems is to suspend the version of reality of the wise scholar who looks though his binoculars or microscope and classifies parts of nature he objectively sees. This arcane character is replaced with another sort of scholar, one who is willing to look in several directions, seeking patterns of interaction.

At its best, being able to see systems requires the observer to muster the muscle to hold multiple inputs and outputs in mind simultaneously, while recognizing that the action of this observing itself is within the ‘clump’ of interactions in process (as we are taught by second order cybernetics).

More than half a century has passed since the beginning of the noble attempt to see the world through this lens. Much new vocabulary has been developed, and patterns have been identified. People have applied systems thinking to their work in myriad professions ranging from social science to art, architecture, and biology. Remarkable contributions have been made to the world with this thinking tool, the Internet being one of them. The visionaries who have taken up systems thinking have done so in the face of professional risk.

These scientists and professionals have embraced uncertainty; they have applied themselves to the difficulty of trying to perceive in a way that allows them to become familiar with processes that take place between disciplines instead of walling up their work within singular fields of study. These rogues have been shunned and rewarded in equal measurement. They have been pioneers in a new conceptual landscape who questioned the most basic assumptions of orthodox ‘knowledge about things.’

For many, the study of systems sciences offers hope for the future. The horizon might be brighter if we could only see the interconnectedness of our world and, in beginning to understand it, we might be less likely to destroy it. As the decades have passed, concepts of interconnectedness and ecology have become familiar. Up until about 20 years ago those words were strange to the ears of most people; now they are the common narrative of green politics, and even advertising campaigns that want to attract a lefty consumer base. Now this work could be co-opted and derailed.

Clarity Obscuring Complexity?

The preference for the safety and surety of the divisions implicit in ‘parts and wholes thinking’ is not a crime; it gives the illusion of making life easier to make sense of and to control. While it may be that thinking in terms of parts and wholes has served us thus far, as we look around the globe we see that there have been some oversights in our understanding of life. From ecological overshoot, to economic volatility, to human trafficking and rampant racism, there is a recurring theme of exploitation. Could our habit of separating the world into parts, which we imagine gear together to function as wholes, be contributing to the segregation of ideas, people, ecologies, and more?

The tidiness of identifying compartmentalized parts and wholes creates muddles at other levels. For one simple instance of this, isn’t the difference between parts and wholes to some extent a matter of scale? Taking the examples of a family-member in a family, and a tree in a forest, it is clear that the person is a whole system, and so is the family of which they are a ‘part,’ just as the tree is a whole system within the whole ecosystem of the forest. Scaling up and down we can identify the systems within systems; scaling down, both the human being and the tree have systems for reproduction; scaling up, both the forest and family are part of still larger landscapes. A piece of music can be arbitrarily divided up into parts. Each instrument could be considered a part, or each stanza with all the instruments playing could be considered a part, or the song itself could be called a part of a genre.

Where are the parts? Where are the wholes?

Transcontextuality and Paradoxes

The habit of drawing divisions between natural processes, between cultures, or between disciplines, and believing that those divisions are necessary cogs in a purposeful mechanism is indeed useful, but only within limits. Our humility in remembering that those divisions are to some degree arbitrary (and stem from the process of observation) keeps the possibilities open for understanding in multiple contexts. The two are not mutually exclusive.

Once identified, parts and wholes get mixed up quickly, and are further confused when one starts to examine multiple contexts. To study the interaction between the organisms in a forest and the ways in which that forest changes over time, is to study many contextual frames—time, weather, bacterial growth/death, relation to humanity, and so on.

Perhaps systems theory needs more dimensions. Transcontextual observation is helpful here, due to the way in which it blurs the outlines of parts, as the identifiable ‘roles’ of the parts and wholes within the ‘function’ of a system are revealed to be contextual. Identity is also not singular in context. We are friends to some people, colleagues to others, parents of our children and children of our parents, but we are also still ourselves.

I am American, and I have lived in other cultures most of my life, and I am a woman, and I am a filmmaker, and I am an educator. I belong in many groupings, and can be defined by them differently. I am, and I am not. None of the circles in the Venn diagram of my life has clear edges. I never stop being American even though my days are filled with Swedish life. They do not erase one another, and they do not agree. They leave open paradoxes pulled into a tension that does not allow for reductionist labeling.

Habitually removing ambiguity requires the simultaneous removal of transcontextual information. Ironically, ambiguity offers insight into more information than tight, arbitrary definitions can do. Arguably, the more transcontextual information one has, the more able one is to ‘suss’ and decide upon a more graceful action. More blurry is actually more clear and vice versa. It is uncomfortable perhaps to lose the concreteness of a single identity, but that singularity was an illusion anyway. Cultural identity is impossible to ignore, but equally impossible to pin down: it has been relentlessly integrating and reintegrating countless influences over the last 1.8 million years. And ‘I’ live in a body that internally requires co-existence with more than 10 trillion organisms, while externally my survival is ecological, emotional, and cultural. I am not an isolatable specimen.

It is these paradoxes of defining characteristics within multiple contexts that bring another sort of clarity to our understanding. I suggest that we need to get better at doing aikido with paradoxes. The impulse to regiment the existence of one group of people in a world of interacting cultures, or one organism in an ecology, or one person in a family, is rooted in the logic that those divisions are realities. They are not. And yet, they are. It is both correct and incorrect to outline parts and wholes. Maddening though that paradox is for doing research, it is the only transcontextual way to account for the variables of interaction over time in complex systems.

The parts exist, the wholes exist, and both can be redefined from other perspectives. But today, an appetite for bite-sized, clearly outlined definitions has trumped any appreciation of complexity in our decision-making. A yearning for the satisfaction of puzzles that fit together has made unresolvable paradoxes untenable in planning committees. In our future studies and the coordination of our efforts to decrease destructive patterns of behavior, we need to become more comfortable with the kind of tension these paradoxes pull us into. While it may sound abstract to say life is transcontextual it is also the most basic practical understanding of nature, starting with our own existence as individuals.

Meta-messages & Presuppostions

The question of how it could happen that systems thinking is used (by neo-Nazis) to justify dividing peoples and cultures needs to be brought before the community of systems and complexity theorists and held up for us to examine with care. The same is true for ecology. What are the social implications of the sort of ‘preservation’ projects that botanical gardens, for example, implement to save native species? Isolation and disruption of interactive change in either realm presents difficult questions. And we need to be extremely careful that the language botanists and zoologists use to talk about species extinction cannot be re-purposed by social engineers.

So how did it happen? Why? To meet the challenge of this query I would like to step back and reassess what it is that we assume is true about systems, about complexity, about why these ideas are useful to our understanding and learning about our world. After all, communication of an idea is not just about describing the idea itself. What is also communicated is the ecology in which that idea lives. Language, culture, assumptions about how life works, these are layers of what is being transmitted that are usually indirect.

The way in which a concept is delivered speaks not only to the concept itself but also offers a description, between the lines, of what is unquestioned. As an example, when someone says the sky is blue, it is assumed that there is an agreement about what ‘blue’ is, and that there is such a thing as a ‘sky.’ The presupposition that both ‘sky’ and ‘blue’ are not in question makes it difficult to enter the discussion with any skepticism of what ‘blue’ might be, or what the ‘sky’ is. The tricky business with presuppostions is that they quietly shrink our ability to see the limits of our assumptions.

My analysis of the situation that I encountered with the neo-Nazi group is that the blind spot is in the presuppositions. The presuppositions are not in what is said or unsaid, but exist in the dimension of what it is possible to say, or to understand as having been said. In scrutinizing the implicit and indirect givens of systems theory and complexity to find the gap this fascist thinking squeaked though, I notice that thinking of life in terms of parts and wholes is assumed. As is the case with epistemological mistakes, the shadow is usually where the issue lies. Here is my father’s description of the issue:

Now, there is a peculiarity of human and animal learning, that it sinks. What you receive at a superficial level becomes what is called ‘habitual,’ and as it becomes habitual it becomes less conscious. That which has sunk to become habit is more difficult to disrupt, to change; and it becomes difficult to change because one has built and organized later information upon it… To change it means disrupting a whole mass of more superficial ideas which one doesn’t want to disrupt because they work out alright. To make the change at a deeper level is difficult. Now, it is particularly the more abstract ideas about relationships that tend to sink and become more unconscious.

—Gregory Bateson, Q&As: ‘Conscious Purpose versus Nature’

What happens if we begin to ask if perhaps the world is not made of parts and wholes? How can we describe it, study it, and in fact… what is it? Where does that land academia? Medicine? Studies of ecology, language, and more? At this level we are addressing the meta-message. I see the ghostly verification of our presupposition that the world is made of parts and wholes in the ways in which we communicate research, theory, strategy, and goals. It is not difficult to see that delivery of data in graphs depicting statistical breakdown of the gathered information implies a methodology. What is not so obvious is the meta-message that life is clear and definable. The models, graphs, and charts that communicate this methodology carry ‘fact’ packaged in such a way that its authority is unquestionable. It says, “this is serious,” “this is how things are done,” and most insidious, “this is how life works.” These are deep, qualitative suggestions that speak, not to the information given, but to the relationships the recipient should have with the information.

In such reports the parts are defined, the function is illustrated, and causation is defined—the presupposition is that the parts are definable, and that causation is based upon their function. The meta-message is that that mechanistic causality is ‘natural.’ ‘Naturally’ we should identify cultures as separate entities, ‘naturally’ we can expect a forest to operate like an engine, and subsequently, ‘naturally we can “control” these parts and wholes.’ However, without mechanistic causality there is no instrumental solution-finding. The question unasked is this: how can we communicate research about transcontextual relations as they learn and re-organize—if the report is communicated using statistical models that lay out and determine boundaries that are paradoxical?

Our ability to communicate is limited by what it has been possible to say. But we will live in the consequences, and the consequences of the consequences of these shadows and binaries. The system through which perception is achieved is inside the larger systems. We could never have this conversation if it were not for language, as there would be no collusion upon which to establish language. But we are in danger of believing what we see as though it were absolute. No one is innocent in this communication crisis: it is becoming a vicious circle of right and left, right and wrong, yay or nay, we and they. The confusion is in the need for clarity. A clarity without ambiguity is one in which we are all asking the wrong questions.

I am suggesting that our notions of parts and wholes are ideas deeply sunken under our conscious perception. Upon these notions our entire industrial epistemology has been built. This is for better and for worse. Either side of the paradox, it is a good practice to tilt the spotlight onto the presuppositions and meta-communication.

Where I’m Coming From: Abbreviated Bateson History

The letters I saw in the Library of Congress were written by scientists and academics, but they were people first. Gregory and Margaret and their friends were people with anger, pain, and disappointment ripping them open. They were able to conceive new ideas out of this caring-pain. The lines are blurred between professional and personal, between political and academic, between then and now. The people matter, and for me this material is extremely personal. In order to contextualize the above stories further, allow me to share some very brief history of the Bateson family.

Gregory, in the 1950s, was part of the Macy Conference group which founded the science of cybernetics. Before that he was an anthropologist in New Guinea and Bali. Much of his anthropological work was done in collaboration with his wife at the time, Margaret Mead. He had come to anthropology via zoology, which he studied at Cambridge. How did he get from zoology to anthropology? For him it was not such a distance, having grown up with his father, the pioneering biologist William Bateson. As the years passed, Gregory would change disciplines and careers several more times, crossing into psychology, information science, ecology, and bring his work in anthropology and zoology with him along the way. Each game change in his studies meant looking at life through another lens.

He has been called an interdisciplinary thinker, a title which I think he would shun. He was not interdisciplinary any more than life is. He was simply studying life, and life is whole. He used the vocabularies and focal points of the many disciplines he visited to increase his perception of the patterns he was attempting to describe.

His father William is famed for having coined the term ‘genetics.’ William was also a great lover of art and was on the board of the British Museum for whom he did a good deal of traveling, which he combined with his genetics studies. Studying culture and environment in the development of an idea or an organism was a question of studying patterns for William. No doubt this way of thinking rubbed off on Gregory. It should be noted that this period (the early 20th century) marked the height of discussions about eugenics. (Eugenics was a popular scientific project that involved improving humans and society by controlling genes and mating practices.)

William came out against eugenics and considered tampering with the complex process of evolution to be a violence against nature. In the quote below we can see how prescient he was about the dangers of this kind of thinking as it applied to genetics. In 1905 William wrote:

What… will happen when… the facts of heredity are… commonly known? One thing is certain: mankind will begin to interfere; perhaps not in England, but in some country more ready to break with the past and eager for ‘national efficiency.’ Mr. Galton has suggested a selection at the top, with State encouragement of families of superlative quality. More probably, and we suspect more effectively, selection will begin by elimination at the bottom… [While] contemporary socialism strives for the elevation of the unfit… that of the future will probably aim at their extinction. Ignorance of the remoter consequences of interference has never long postponed such experiments. When power is discovered man always turns to it. The science of heredity will soon provide power on a stupendous scale; and in some country, at some time, not, perhaps, far distant, that power will be applied to control the composition of a nation. Whether the institution of such control will ultimately be good or bad for that nation or for humanity at large is a separate question.

—1905 review of Archdall Reid’s The Principles of Heredity

At the time William wrote this, Gregory was a toddler. It would be 50 more years before systems thinking was to emerge as its own field of study. But William was already interested in the way evolution required context and the curious relationship between the notion of individual parts of a system within an environment. In 1888 in a letter to his sister Anna he wrote:

My brain boils with Evolution. It is becoming a perfect nightmare to me. I believe now it is an axiomatic truth that no variation, however small, can occur in any part without other variation occurring in correlation to it in all other parts; or, rather, that no system, in which a variation of one part had occurred without such correlated variation in all other parts could continue to be a system. This follows from what one knows of the nature of an “individual,” whatever that may be. If then, it is true that no variation could occur if it were not arranged that other variations should occur, in correlation with it, in all parts, all these correlated variations are dictated by the initial correlation acting as an environmental change. Therefore the occurrence of any variation in a system is a proof that all parts have the power of changing with environmental change and must of necessity do so.

—William Bateson, Naturalist

William broke with the scientific community of his time for many reasons. He left Cambridge and began his research in Norwich where he employed a laboratory of strident, brilliant women scientists respectfully referred to now as the Snap Dragons. But, it would be many years before the world was ready for the kind of systemic ideas William was toying with. Perhaps the world still is not ready.

Continuing to Learn

Today the situation seems only to be growing worse as hundreds of thousands of people need to be moved to new homes. The horror of this deepening darkness is that it is so hard to see. It is like an invisible monster that inflicts invisible wounds, which, with time, will surface as commonsense reasons for violence, greed, and exploitation. In time, the hurt transforms into meta-messages that our children will live in. The upsurge of the ultra-right in Europe and the US has heated up controversy around nationalism, immigration, and notions of purity of culture. To read the newspapers and watch the news is to be inundated with arguments that either cut down the support offered to incoming refugees or shame the right-wing anti-immigration groups as inhumane. The by-product of the division is blame and insults from all directions.

The socio-economic patterns we live in are deadly. Some kind of systemic overhaul is needed. But we cannot erase what has come before. There can be no return to an imaginary blank canvas, or status quo ante. Whatever bitterness has brewed between nations, generations, and ethnic groups will weaken their future. I have no doubt that the most desirable real estate in Europe ten years from now will be in the places where the integration of incoming refugee and immigrant groups was treated with the most grace.

I would also suggest that the idea of collapse as a form of rebirth is not without scar tissue that will inform future generations in both toxic and productive ways. Collapse is also a linear narrative, awkwardly but compellingly wrought into global ecological and cultural complexity. From here we can only add to the broth of human history as it is mingled into the history of the planet’s systems. There is no way to fix all that is broken now. Broken families, broken countries, broken cultures, failing ecosystems, volatile economies, lost identity: from the smallest scale to the most global, human interaction is clumsy and destructive. But to see the distortions of our world as the consequences of the way in which systems have learned to interact, is to offer a new entry point. Perhaps this entry point holds both history and possibility within the ever-shifting process of learning.

Lately I have been asked to describe where I see hope for the future. Or, in fact if I see hope. I do. I see hope in the possibility of adding another ingredient to our stew of ideological notions about how we make sense of our world, and altering the flavor of that stew slightly. That may seem inconsequential; it may even seem frivolous, but I contend that the shift we need is not only in our actions, but in the logic in which those actions are forged. In this era of global crisis, we often speak of ‘paradigm shift’ and ‘systems change’ as necessary prerequisites for the survival of the biosphere and humanity. I am not sure that our attempts at either of those concepts will turn out as we might intend. But, there is another possibility. The ingredient that I would like to add to the pot is the notion of life as mutual learning contexts. To change the flavor of our ideological stew by asking ‘how is mutual learning taking place in this context?’ is to re-contextualize that which has come before us and reset the horizon. I see this shift in perception of our systems as a significant altering of the way in which observing takes place, and consequently, the way in which observations are made. It is early in the development of this idea to give it such weight, but it could be that the addition of mutual learning processes to the premises of systems knowledge can avert the potentially dangerous habit of describing complex systems in terms of parts and wholes.

![[p161-01.jpg]]Symmathesy

Part I: Prologue

This chapter overlaps with other material in this book with the intent that it will be (as it has already been) reprinted as a stand-alone piece.

Proposition

I would like to propose a new word for ‘system’ that refers specifically to living systems—that is, to systems which emerge from communications and interactions. The new word, and concept, that I propose is one that highlights the expression and communication of interdependency and, particularly, mutual learning. The existing word, ‘system,’ while useful in many cases, does not suggest the contextual fields of simultaneous learning that are necessary for life. We have learned that, when dealing with living systems, mechanistic parameters cannot hold the many variables of developing interaction. So the inclusion of mutual learning in the terminology is specifically meant to move our description beyond the models of engineering and mechanism that are implicit in much systems theorizing.

This change in language that I am proposing should spark a significant shift in our work, in the sciences, applied professions, communication, and arts that address or depend upon our understanding of life and evolution. The discourse with which we discuss and study the living world should be representative of the living world, and should cautiously avoid connotations that imply or are derived from engineering.

The notion of systems as an arrangement of parts and wholes has become a distraction from the new systemic vision, which I have described in this book and which sees life as relational, mutual learning contexts. As studies, ranging from cognitive science to epigenetics, social science, ecology and evolutionary theory, are increasingly showing, evolution emerges in interrelationality, not in arrangement. So we must differentiate between living systems and other systems.

Biology, culture, and society are dependent at all levels upon the vitality of interaction they produce internally and externally. A body, a family, a forest, or a city can each be described as a buzzing hive of communication between and within its living, interacting ‘parts.’ Together the organs of your body allow you to make sense of the world around you. A jungle can be understood best as a conversation among its flora and fauna, including the insects, the fungi of decay, and contact with humanity. Interaction is what creates and vitalizes the integrity of the living world. Over time, the survival of the organisms in their environments requires that there be learning, and learning to learn, together. Gregory Bateson said, “The evolution is in the context.” So why don’t we have a word for those bodies, families, forests, and other buzzing hives of communication—and for the mutual learning that takes place within those living contexts?

With this in mind, I have combined the Greek words syn/sym (together) and mathesi, (to learn), to create symmathesy (learning together). A working definition of symmathesy might look like this:

Symmathesy (noun): (Pronounced: sym-math-a-see)

1. an entity formed over time by contextual mutual learning through interaction. For example, an ecosystem at any scale, like a body, family, or forest is a symmathesy.

2. the process of contextual mutual learning through interaction.

Symmathesize (verb, intrans.):

to generate contextual mutual learning through the process of interaction between multiple variables in a living entity.

Defining life in terms of ‘parts and wholes’ quickly slips into thinking in terms of arrangement and mechanistic function. The advantage is that it provides separate subject boxes for us to study and arrange our studies within. It has leveraged our thinking into all that we know as science and technology. The downside is that the idea of things being arranged into ‘parts and wholes’ blinds us to the developing interactions that take place in life. The ‘parts,’ like members of a family, organs in a body, or species in a jungle, exist inside—and are integral to—larger evolutionary processes.

If symmathesy describes the ‘whole’ (and the process of inter-learning that happens constantly in the ‘whole’), then it’s clear that we also need a better word for the ‘parts.’ For this I have borrowed the Latin word vita (life), plural: vitae. A working definition might look like this:

Vita (noun; plural: vitae): (Pronounced: veet-a and veet-eye)

Any aspect of a living entity that, through interfaces of learning, forms a larger living entity or symmathesy. For example, the ‘members’ of a family, organs in the body, or flora and fauna in a forest.

In my work I have found that the confusion about when something is a part and when it is a whole is not useful to our studies as we begin to seek information across contexts. Transcontextual analysis of complex systems requires flexibility to accommodate multiple descriptions of each variable in that system. The ability to perceive paradox, and avoid the impulse to choose a path down one side or the other, is essential for our future interactions with complex systems.

These living vitae do not ‘work’ in the way that an engine works, not even a very complicated engine. The difference is the compensatory relationality and communication in which the vitae are engaged. Through complex cybernetic entanglements of interaction, living entities become vessels of communication. Instead of ‘parts’ and ‘wholes,’ let us think of vitae whose boundaries in a symmathesy act as interfaces of learning.

Interdependency is vital to the health of any system. But, the interdependency does not sit still. All of biological evolution, and the development of culture and society, seem to be a testament to the characteristics of contextual, multilayered shiftings through time. Nothing stays the same, clearly. I am suggesting that change, then, is a kind of learning. If a living entity transforms some of its contextual interrelationships, even slightly, that shift requires a calibration within which change is revealed. The same kind of tree in the same forest does not necessarily grow to be the same shape. One may have higher winds to contend with, another may grow with a thicker density of flora around it. The trees in these contrasting contexts live into their contexts by receiving the many forms of relational information they are surrounded by and part of, and responding to them. Thus they grow to be different shapes, to metabolize at different levels, and so on.

Our conceptual understanding of the living world can be elevated with a new terminology that better describes the processes we are referring to within it. This new terminology is a step toward a clearer understanding of the way we describe the difference between what we can ‘control,’ i.e. in material terms, and that which requires another approach, i.e. interacting with the complexity of evolving, living systems.

What is the difference between learning and life? None.

When is something living not learning? Never.

The concept I outline in the following pages is my attempt to provide what I hope will be a useful fusion of ideas. I invite you to recognize its combined sources in systems theory (including complexity theory and developmental systems theory), as well as the theory of Mind, presented by Gregory Bateson in his book Mind and Nature. While both of these bodies of work have provided the roots of our work today in the International Bateson Institute, I have found that within those vocabularies I habitually need to clarify the terms, so as to incorporate the transcontextual and ever-changing variables of life. This has become a task that invariably accompanies studies of complexity. The explanation needed to differentiate the characteristics of a living system from a mechanical system seems to necessitate a repeated listing of the processes of interrelationship that currently must be tagged onto every discussion. Equally distracting is the explanation needed to differentiate between Gregory Bateson’s ideas of Mind as life, from a related contemporary idea which it is connected to, but not reducible to, namely ‘neurocognition.’ While for me Mind is much closer to being a usable concept, the tendency in our culture to confuse ‘mind’ with ‘brain’ creates a rabbit warren of misunderstandings around the notion of immanent Mind for many people. This tension between the concepts Gregory Bateson developed and called Mind, and systems theory, has provided a base from which I have begun to play with the idea of mutual learning as the basis of life.

Mutual Learning Contexts

It is difficult if not impossible to find a subject to study in the living world that is definable within a single context. The International Bateson Institute was founded in 2014 with the mission of developing a process of inquiry that would begin to take into account the many contexts within which any particular field of study exists within. Transcontextual research offers multiple descriptions of the way in which a ‘subject’ is nested in many contexts. This information provides descriptions of interactions that seem to erase the boundaries of what we might have previously considered to be parts and wholes. As we have seen, medicine is entwined in culture, food, environmental conditions, education, economic stability, and more. Economy is formed through culture, transportation, resources, media, education, etc. Research conducted without the study of multiple contexts treats the subject as though it were isolated from the symmathesies it exists within, and therefore a great deal of data is not visible.

Inquiry that stretches multiple contexts has begun to reveal that the interaction between vitae provides more information and a more integrative set of possibilities for interaction with the complexity of a given set of ‘subjects.’ Any symmathesy, such as a person, a family, a forest, a nation, or an institution, can be viewed or studied in the hope of revealing the way in which it has learned to form itself within the contexts it interfaces with. Like a great living puzzle whose pieces morph into compensatory responsive shapes, living systems require that we develop a language to hold the conceptual multiplicity of perspectives. As students of life, we have to be able to consider the variables at a higher order. Transcontextual research reveals new interactions and provides a wider angle lens with which to explore many fields of inquiry.

Immediately we see that there are questions that need to be addressed in order to flesh out the concept of symmathesy: Is a living entity a thing, or is it a part of a greater relational process? Can a living entity be both? To incorporate a comprehensive base in our syntax of this theory, I believe we will need to stretch even our understanding of grammar.

The development of the conceptual arena for symmathesy and symmathesies will continue over time and with multiple scholars, artists, and professionals. But a few considerations need to be addressed as they fold into the definition of what a symmathesy is and what the process of symmathesy entails. As a word, ‘symmathesy’ is part of a family of terms that describe the relational characteristics of the living world. Other terms in this family include symmetry, symbiosis, sympoiesis, and system. Each of these terms includes a prefix indicating ‘together’—sym or syn—followed by a focus on order, growth, pattern, and so on. Symmathesy is a newcomer to this family of concepts and draws attention to mutual learning.

The tendency to think in terms of functioning parts and wholes is misleading for our future inquiry of living, co-evolving systems.Metabolism, immunity, cognition, culture, and ecology are all examples of living interactions. Within these examples, perception, communication, and learning are observable as open-ended interchanges in and between a tangle of varying perspectives. The new vocabulary I am proposing is an attempt to address the increasing mix-ups in our inquiry into living ‘systems’ as they are differentiated from mechanical ones.

The primary limit of the word ‘system’ is its invocation of ‘arrangement’ (inherent in the Greek prefix ‘sys’). This, as we have just seen, relates to the way in which we have culturally been trained to explain and study our world in terms of parts and wholes and the way they ‘work’ together. The connotations of this systemic functional arrangement are mechanistic; which does not lend itself to an understanding of the messy contextual and mutual learning/evolution of the living world.

This is especially true in regard to the single-plane, contextual boundaries within which most interrelationality is seen. No living thing exists in just one context. Therefore, the illustrations and deductions formed from observations that are derived from a singular contextual perspective lack dimension. Multiple contextual viability has to this point not been taken into account within theoretical models of living systems. Transcontextual research and understanding is only just beginning to address the multiple contextual existences of living systems. To better understand the errors generated by explanation in terms of parts and wholes, the transcontextual descriptions render several versions of would-be parts and wholes in play in multiple contextual frames. Life does not separate those frames; rather, it depends upon their melting together.

It is impossible to separate my experience as a daughter from my experience as a mother; it is also impossible to separate my cultural identity from my professional, personal, or social selves. All of those contexts are simultaneous, but reveal vital differences in the knitting together of my transcontextual life. Parts and wholes do not sit still when they are outlined through different contextual boundaries.

Reductionism lurks around every corner, mocking the complexity of the living world we are part of. It is not easy to maintain a discourse in which the topic of study is both in detail, and in context. The tendency is to create categories, and to assign correlations between them. But an assigned correlation between a handful of ‘disciplinary’ perspectives, which we often see, does not adequately represent the diversity of the learning fields within the context(s). The language of systems is built around describing chains of interaction. But when we consider a forest, a marriage, or a family, we can see that living entities such as these require another conceptual addition in their description: learning.

If not parts and wholes, what is a symmathesy comprised of?

Shifting our understanding of the make-up of the conglomeration of interactions that form a living entity so that we are not defining parts and wholes is the first step in our understanding of this new term. After all, the ‘parts’ or vitae in a living entity are also learning from each other within the context of interrelationship with the external environment. As such they are hardly distinguishable as ‘parts.’

Why is the term ‘part’ no longer fit for purpose? If we see the context (whole) as produced by its components (parts), confusion arises: we find that the outline of the context is scalable and, in fact, that there are multiple contexts, rendering the notion of parts hard to define. I am not suggesting that our inquiry should be conducted only in terms of wholes. There are boundaries. It is easy to see the boundaries of our bodies, cities, or the oceans, as ‘parts’ of the world. But often our drawing of these boundaries is based upon arbitrary lines that are convenient for our description.

The habit of conceptualizing in this way creates confusion at another level: how we see the interactions and interrelationships. If we perceive that the functions of living ecologies are the effect of processes taking place between parts and wholes, we tend to assign agency to parts. We divide the ecology in order to label it and specify the ‘functions’ of the processes that give the ecology life. The drawback to this approach is that the focus centers on the bits and their ‘roles’ while losing sight of the contextual integrity. Agency implies that parts can be separated from wholes and exert individuated action. In symmathesy thinking, the idea of agency should be treated as a paradox that necessarily resides between the existence of the organism as a unique entity, and the simultaneous impossibility that this entity can be decontextualized or in any way uninfluenced by its contextual interactions. This is because the formation of the ecology in question is necessarily evolving within its context, not its parts. If an entity exists within a continual process of communication with the many influences of its contextual settings, the individuality of purpose of that entity is inextricable from the interaction. It still has a bias or epistemological perspective that is unique but, at the same time, not individuated.

In a human context, the notion of an identity that is ever truly independent is impossible to outline. None of us can be separate from language, culture, interaction with nature, food, air, social relationships, education, familial relationships, epigenetic history, and so on. Though it is tempting to claim ‘I’ as a territory, each of us has more than 70 billion organisms in our bodies all of which are responding to temperature, sugar balances, hormonal changes, emotional changes, and so on. The particular accumulation and arrangements of those influences are unique within each of us, but we exist inside a larger set of variables at all times. What then is agency? Increasingly, studies are revealing that the microbacteria in our guts have a greater than expected influence on our desires, socially, as well as in terms of food. Mood, memory, cognition, and health are all indistinguishable from contextual relationships. That does not mean we are not responsible for our actions, it means our responsibility extends to larger contexts than our own skin.

What triggers the particular wherewithal for one sibling to become an activist while another becomes a business person? The way in which contextual and multi-contextual interactions inform our responses to the world around us would appear to be another version of will or agency. Perhaps this is more about the unique arrangement that each person learns to live within. Proclivities and aversions, aptitudes and challenges all form an aesthetic of learning and mutual learning that we might call ‘character.’ Are we our character? Are we what is in our skin? Our family? Our culture? Our language? Our diet? Our muscle system? Our monetary worth? Where are the edges and where in the complexity of self does our independence lie? As I mentioned above, there are paradoxes here to be noticed. Perhaps these paradoxes should not be solved, but instead allowed to co-exist.

We are, and we are not. We are individuals, but we are also not separable.

In non-human contexts the illusion of agency is perhaps easier to perceive. The mutuality that any living organism is existing together with (its symmathesy) is part of its continual formation and learning. The context is not inside any of the vitae, rather it is created in the interaction. Where is the culture of a city? Is it in the history? In the language? In the religion? In the environmental constraints? It is not locatable in any of these ‘parts,’ yet all of them are integral to the cohesion of the symmathesy. ‘Vitae’ invite us to think in terms of the ‘parts’ being alive, and not simply cogs. At the same time the ‘whole’ is best thought of as another interactive symmathesy in the next larger context. In the example of the human body, it is habitual to think of our organs as parts of the whole, but each organ is in fact contributing to a contextual interaction. The ‘function’ of the ‘parts’ is indistinguishable from their interaction (the ‘whole’) that is always learning. Their mutual interaction in turn becomes the immanent viability of the entity in a contextual evolution (learning).

Multiple Description and Interfaces

I described earlier our research with the IBI (International Bateson Institute), where we engage in a process of inquiry centered on the search for relational data, which we call ‘Warm Data.’ The IBI aims to devise and design research methodologies that use multiple description to illustrate how interactions in complex systems interlink. These multiple descriptions increase our ability to take into account the integrity of multilayered living systems, to think about multilayered ‘interactions,’ and to respond at a contextual level. Revealing the inter-weavings of complex systems needs a research method that can encompass the many contexts in which the system forms interdependency. As a result, these studies are also transcontextual.

The complexity of this sort of inquiry is daunting. If we are to study, for example, the way in which food impacts our lives, a multi-faceted study of ecology, culture, agriculture, economy, cross-generational communication, media, and more must be brought to our research in a linking of interfaces that together provide a rigorous beginning place from which we may better understand what is on our plates. From that beginning position our inquiry into eating disorders, poverty, hunger, and the dangers of GMOs can be approached in another fashion altogether. How do these contexts interface with one another?

IBI research is necessarily reported and presented using multiple description. Within this process we become acutely aware that, in our multiple description of living ecologies, the notion of parts within a system breaks down. When we engaged our multiple descriptions of either the ‘system’ or the ‘parts’ we found we were limited. We need not look further than our own hand for an illustration of this. What is a hand? Is it the thing at the end of your arm? A violinist has memory and ongoing learning in her hands. A sculptor has another sort of learning in his hands. We each have handwriting that is almost but never quite consistent. We know the touch of our partner. A deaf person uses the hand to express language. We gesture, we stroke, we sense, we know, we learn through our hands… So what is a hand?

The hand is a ‘part,’ but it is alive and integrated into larger contexts of living and learning, or symmathesy. It is important to the use of the concept of symmathesy to think about the boundaries and ‘parts’ of living things as interfaces. The outlines we draw around ‘parts’ (like a hand or a kidney) are useful to us as arbitrary separations that conveniently contain our study within limits we can manage; but these outlines more aptly serve to indicate areas of interaction, transmission, and reception of information. The skin of my body provides what looks like a boundary around me, but ‘I’ extend well beyond the container of my flesh, both biologically and socially. Touch, temperature, expression, health, embarrassment, and so much more information is transmitted through the skin. The same can be said of the edges of a forest. While those boundaries may look like where the forest ends and another landscape begins, a great deal of interaction between animals and plants will take place at the margins. In this sense, the boundaries are vital interfaces for communication and learning.

This is a rigorous endeavor. The pull of our old ‘parts and wholes’ thinking is difficult to escape, but the vistas from which we can begin to view life anew with these concepts reveal possibilities of richer inquiry.

Models need Remodeling

A signature depiction of a ‘system’ as generated through systems theory and complexity theory is the modeled imagery of boxes and arrows representing an arrangement of parts and wholes. Sometimes these illustrations also include arrows to denote ‘process.’ But, from the perspective of symmathesy, we see that dire errors are made whenever we diagram living systems with the usual boxes and arrows. In fact, I would go so far as to say that there is no model or diagram that can effectively illustrate the learning within the context.

Symmathesy does not fit into these ‘boxes and arrows’ descriptions. The mutual learning in the context is not visible through boxes and arrows or concentric circles or any geometric designs. In a push against the cultural inclination to use engineering diagrams to discuss the complexity of life, symmathesy must be illustrated either through life itself or through symbolic representation that communicates at multiple levels (e.g. art).

Our existing forms of explanatory process and the meta-messaging of the ‘report’ of those explanations repeat the mechanistic patterns and the logic that is normative within them. For our purposes—illustrating and expressing the presentational communication of symmathesy—caution is needed to avoid the traps of thinking in terms of blocks. Thing-i-fying in our studies will derail our ability to perceive the symmathesy. Consider the challenge of graphing one’s own learning within language, culture, family, community, society, etc. The process is so multilayered and broadly spread through us all that description requires a wider language.

Art may be the only way to truly describe living complexity. Why? Because living entities exist in interaction over time. They are learning continually and any direct defining of the ‘parts’ of a learning context would necessarily be temporally limited and likely obsolete by the time it was made. Even if the structure of the organism is kindred in pattern to others of its type (like a heart, in the case of a body, or a reed in the case of a riverbed), the viability of the organism is critically dependent on its ability to live vis- à-vis the other living organisms in its conjoinment. In other words, the organisms all have to change. They all have to learn.

Part II: The Word in Meta-Communication

The words we use to describe living things carry meta-meanings

Symmathesy is a word that directs perception to the larger, learning interactions of variables in a context.

For decades the word ‘system’ has played its part in communicating the notions we are trying to describe. So why change it now?

The ability to increase the precision of our thinking in this realm is hopefully aided by this new distinction, in its metaphor, implication, and inferences. Words say more than they spell. The great anthropologist Margaret Mead used to stick her tongue out when she spoke. I am told she claimed she was “tasting the words.” People with synesthesia hear colors, see music, and feel sensations around words. The transfer of perceptions into one another like colors into music, tastes into words, emotions into smells (and so on), provides a natural cross-referencing of information. Numbness to the flavor and the sensation of words is common in what we think of as normality. Symmathesy, as a term, changes the flavor of the thoughts and theories we can generate about life, placing them inextricably in relation to each other, and in a state of constant learning.

Perhaps we all have the capacity to increase our synesthetic perceptions. I do not believe that anyone is really immune to the potions that words spill. A word is more than a mere combination of letters and sounds. The potency of words reaches the substrata of all of us. Words carry culture and history; they form and confine our thoughts. Words matter.

To discuss the sort of things we want to discuss here—things like families and cultures, ecologies and organizations—we have to care about the words we place on the page, and the words we shape in our mouths. We will live in them, and our stories will be decorated with their upholstery. The intellectual and emotional acreage of our domain has a periphery of worded fences. They hold us as we hold them. To stand by our existing words, in systems and complexity theory, limits the development of our ideas—the words are inadequate. So often the word for something or someone is a box, an outline, a set of limits—a tightness that isolates the ‘subject’ from its context. The vocabulary of this field of inquiry funnels us in, and hacks into our epistemology with sneaky inferences.

When we think of systems, what do we perceive? How do we describe what we perceive? How do we think?

The patterns of the mechanistic lens have enchanted us through every aspect of our lives. The range of this affectation includes education, politics, medicine, business, marriage, parenting, and our relationship at all of these junctions to the biosphere we live within. The stench of machine oil is everywhere as parts and wholes are geared towards ‘function’ in clicking and clanging bits that leverage the pattern into position. It ‘WORKS.’ Or, when it does not, we say it has become dysfunctional… i.e. the cogs are bent, and the thing can’t turn.

Part III: What is Learning in Symmathesy?

Since the term symmathesy pivots on the idea of mutual learning, we need to consider carefully what we mean by ‘learning.’ What is learning?

Most common definitions of learning involve the acquisition of knowledge within a progression of stages relative to physical or intellectual development. By contrast, in our terminology, learning has been stretched to include the entire living world as a context of learning—as a symmathesy composed of symmathesies. Learning has also been stretched to include much of what we think of as adaptation and even addiction. Of course, the living world itself is made up of living worlds. Learning in symmathesy is the perpetual processes of positioning and repositioning, calibrating, shifting, and responding to responses within contexts of multiple, simultaneous interactions. Here, the term ‘learning’ is closer to co-evolution, though I am hesitant to invite the connotations of ‘improvement’ that the word evolution carries. Learning in symmathesy does not imply bettering or progress. Likewise, the terms ‘adaptation’ and ‘co-adaptation’ signal a notion of fitting in, or alteration, as organisms adjust to one another. This is closer to the learning within symmathesy, but still differs in that the interaction between them over time is seen here as contextual mutual learning which continues and does not ‘fit.’ Here are some of the characteristics of learning in symmathesy:

Contexts: Learning in symmathesy is contextual, even at the smallest scale. The interrelationality within which any living thing exists, presents contexts of both internal and external interactions. For example, my survival depends on the internal workings of my body (the nervous system, digestive system, circulatory system, and so on), my external relationship with the biological world (for air, water, food, etc.), and all the other interactions in my life. But these are not independent of each other. The ‘loving’ or ‘mean’ things that someone says at breakfast have an effect on blood pressure, digestive process, and cognitive (implicit or explicit) understanding of identity within a culture. The same sort of interdependencies exist in a forest. Though the nodes of receipt and transmission of information may be more difficult to assign, the processes necessary to the continued life of the forest are woven into the contexts of the relationships between the micro-organisms, the flora, the fauna, the climate—as well as the internal processes of each tree, the extension of its roots, the transportation of its sap, the photosynthesis in its leaves, and so on. In either of these examples, the living organism must position and reposition itself within its context of variables and interrelationships in order to survive. What is more, the society I live in is located within a larger, shifting field of countless variables, as is the forest around the tree we spoke of. The contexts are variables that are learning together.

Calibration: Learning in symmathesy is an ongoing process of calibration (precise and continuous adjustment) within contexts of aggregate, interrelational variables. This calibration does not require conscious involvement. The learning that any living thing must continue within (if it is not to become obsolete) is a wide-angle process of receiving and responding to information. This information is sensed as difference and is received from simultaneous multiple interactions. (Gregory Bateson referred to this definition of information as the “difference that makes a difference.”) Complexity does not divide itself, and therefore life requires calibration within multiple streams of information and interaction. In order to do a simple task, such as walk across a room, a staggering calibration must take place. (If you’re carrying soup, it’s even harder—as described in the chapter called ‘The Fortune Teller.’) Likewise, our forest tree registers the direction of the wind and sun, and the context of the forest it lives in. These will influence the tree at every scale, and their effects will even be visible to us in its shape as the tree calibrates the growth and placement of its branches, and the pathways of its roots, for example. Learning is the process we are referring to here as calibration within variables of interrelationship.

Bias: The bias of the calibrating entity at every scale is the particular integration of the multiple variables of interrelating information influencing the entity–the person, the organ, the tree, the forest, or even the culture. The bias forms differences. The bias could be thought of in terms of the ‘epistemology’ or the ‘Umwelt’ of the symmathesy. (In the early days of Biosemiotics the term ‘Umwelt’ was introduced by Jakob von Uexküll as part of a theory which proposed that each organism in an environment has its own perspective. The perspective of a particular symmathesy gives it an outline, an interface, and an aesthetic through which to filter and frame, on an ongoing basis, the information it calibrates.)

To put it more simply, imagine there is a bowl of blueberries provided for a table of friends. It is our habit to assume that blueberries are blueberries, that the numeric nutritional values and knowable recipes for serving blueberries are obvious. However, the bias of each person at the table presents a collection of understandings and filters through which the blueberries are ‘known.’ For one person at the table blueberries may be a reminder of summer, a family activity of picking the small blue orbs from the forest bushes in Scandinavia for a pie, a social sweet spot. For another, the fruit may be a smoothie ingredient to eat after a workout, a symbol of health, a super-food, a virtue. For another person at the same table the blueberries may be a visceral trigger of memories of a smell of blueberry pie being baked during a traumatic experience of being raped by a relative. These three associations and physical, epistemological understandings of blueberries describe the informational bias in the perception of the beholder. The numerical nutritional values of the blueberries are altered by this bias. The digestive system, the nervous system, the seasons, the conversation at the table… all of these alter the way in which each person incorporates the blueberries into their luncheon. So what are blueberries?

Stochastic process: While learning is a process of evolution existing in patterns that appear stable, the random inputs and the implicit variables between the vitae of a symmathesy are unpredictable. There is pattern and there is also unpredictability (the term ‘stochastic’ here refers to that unpredictability). There is structure, and there is process. My children, for example, are not born puppies, they are human and share some physical characteristics with me; but they are also nothing like me. They live in another context. The paradox that this combination forms is inherent and unsolvable. The contingency for life and therefore learning is that the tangles of relation, communication, and information between all the vitae of a symmathesy are simultaneous. Both in pattern and in process.

Play: Practice, repetition, and experimentation in communication and behavior around the edges of a bias are the frontiers of learning, evolution, and change. The boundaries are ‘played with’ when the kitten play-fights with the other kittens, discovering the process, practicing the communication, and finding the edges of the game. Play is the combined discovery and opportunity to embody new ideas. As Jeff Bloom says, “‘acquisition of knowledge’ is really just a lower level learning, which has been raised to the top in our positivist/mechanist/boxist/quantitativist society. Acquisition of knowledge is a by-product of deeper learning.” In other words, play is a process of learning to learn. It may look like games, humor, art, experimenting, fighting, attempting, re-organizing, and more.

Boundaries: For the purposes of examining the possibilities of symmathesy, boundaries are the interfaces of learning. When discussing contextual learning, it is indeed a challenge to consider the dilemma of ‘where is the edge of the context?’ The boundaries can be seen as what separates me from you, or us from a forest, or the forest from a school—and these are seemingly real and true. The fact of their separateness is a fact of vitality even in the interaction required for life. A body needs a heart and lungs and a nervous system: the difference in these is as necessary as the unity of them. But, it should be noted that boundaries disappear when seen from a wider viewpoint. From the vista of society, the functioning of one individual’s heart is eclipsed by larger contextual patterns. To clarify this confusion, there is often an impulse to diagram the contexts within contexts as a set of concentric circles. But such a diagram, however tempting it might to be to illustrate it in this way, will be fraught with errors. Why? Because the boundaries are the differences, the areas of interaction, the communication interfaces that provide the contact, dependency, and bias of the process of ecology. They are not static. The boundaries represent a paradox. Such a diagram is a freeze-frame: time is missing from it. The inclusion of time will blur the lines; the contexts are interactive and learning.

Time: All living organisms, and the vitae of all living organisms, are revealed as existing within a context of mutual learning when time is taken into consideration. Time reveals that order is not static. A quest for the organization of life’s process has been at the heart of the natural sciences since their inception. Why are we here? Where are we going? How does evolution work? As the natural sciences have increased our ability to see the smallest details of our world, the mapping of life has become possible in new ways. The discovery of DNA, the genome, and colliding particles have each opened wide horizons of possible new research. However, with a shove in the direction of the quest for mutual learning in life, the organization of the pieces falls from the forefront of our studies, and instead the study finds information located most profoundly in how interrelationality moves through time. Learning together. Communication, for example, is often described as an interaction; a process of signal and response between parts of a system. Semiotic process, in this simplistic view which is not typical of advanced semiotic thinking, is mere transfer of information. But add time to that process and the interaction becomes mutual learning.

Order and Symmetry in a Learning World

Given these early criteria for learning and change in a living context, it is also important to acknowledge order and form. Surely, there is order and symmetry in the world. Anyone noticing a daisy or a language or in fact their own hand will perceive that there is structure in the world we live in. Our impression of order is embedded to the extent that it is often difficult with some forms of order to keep in mind the constant, if very slow, transformation.

The phrase that my father Gregory Bateson used—‘the pattern that connects’—is an enigmatic one. For some the pattern is ‘findable.’ It is a code that can be discovered and understood. But for others ‘the pattern that connects’ is taken as permission to contemplate a world in constant change which takes place in ways that can elude our culture’s customary styles of reasoning. The paradox of seeing ‘the pattern that connects’ as both process and form requires us, as observers, to expand our capacity to think about what order is. This is a paradox that we are not trained to accommodate in our thinking process, let alone in our research.

No matter how slow the movement, both form and process are in constant play in the living world. An accessible example of this is that, as we just considered, a child may resemble its parents, but will not be a duplicate of them. Some patterns transfer and appear to repeat, while others do not. The form in this case provides recognizable similarities, like hair color or even facial expressions. But the context in which the child is raised is not the same as the one in which the parents grew up. Siblings who grow up in the same house even occupy different contexts and patterns of communication. They are alike—and different—due to a combination of heredity and contextual responses.

An observer who takes the time to admire the structure of a daisy or a language or their hand might begin to see that these forms inform. What do they inform? If we are able to see an organism, or a living ecology at any scale, in its interrelationships, then our study of that particular symmathesy will begin to include its relations. Let us look again at the example of the hand, formerly a part of the body, now better understood as a vita.

The hand is an interface of human interaction and I would argue that we cannot know the whole spectrum of this interfacing. My children’s use of the iPhone is testament to applications, purposes, and processes I would not have considered 20 years ago. But let’s start by saying the hand offers ways of interacting. Touch, signals, tools, skills, and countless other uses of the hand are relational processes that the form of the hand provides. Likewise, a daisy’s petals are messaging interfaces with the ecology that the plant inhabits. Language, too, is a form and a process of interaction. It is a structure within which to find symmetry and definition, but with variables and changeability. The outlines blur. The forms exist in time, and over time they change.

The shapes and characteristics that are recognizable and seem to repeat are languaging a sort of conversation—or contributing messages to a larger ecological conversation. This conversation is one we might call ‘order.’ Vitae like the hand are interfaces in multiple contexts. The observer’s ability to hold simultaneous contextual descriptions of the hand will offer deeper and more complex understanding. The definition of the hand is more valuable if the contexts or sets of relationships are brought into the description. Within the form lie the communicative and information processes that enjoin contextual ecologies and provide the fodder for symmathesy.

Part IV: The Word in the Belly

This transition in thinking is a personal, cultural, political, and academic dilemma

To provide a credible account of the thinking shift here, I have given this issue its voice in formal prose, but it does not live there. The dilemma of how we change our thinking about ‘systems’ is one which should be addressed at all its levels simultaneously. In the description below I have veered from the language of formal prose. To address the depth of these mechanistic habits of thinking is to go downstairs below our verbal conscious awareness, and that requires other language. We treat prose seriously and give it credibility, and consider this form of communication to be rational and precise. Words in prosaic syntax have gravitas in our culture. They appear to offer conceptual stability. But this stability is an impossibility that scientific and non-fictional discourse fail to account for. Science changes all the time; discoveries are perishable and get replaced by new discoveries as old knowledge is expanded upon and, at times, eclipsed by perpetual learning. Descriptions in this form are still stuffed with metaphors, still wound around invisible narratives. In fact, it is reasonable and responsible to ask whether life, love, or culture can really be described with words. To discuss the patterns and processes of the living world we will need to open the form, open the genres of our communication.

Can we describe life? Can we even describe ourselves? When we try, what are the cultural lenses that filter our perception?

We will not find the symmathesy if we do not name it. The word matters. Words are what we have. They are the best means we have to paint our thoughts onto pages, and to house the resonance of voice in the horizons of conversation. They are the script we speak within, or perhaps step out of. Either way, the playbook is always there as a pivot. What we say is a measure of what we have not said. Words have salt. They are wise. They nourish and poison. They are not located. They lie, and in lying show us the edges of our honesty. A child’s tantrum is a tone and stomp and twenty repeating words that roughly say, “don’t tell me what to do.” A lover’s exit is too many words that try too hard to buy smooth departure and fail. Words are there for so many logistics, so much weather, a lot of ‘nice to meet you’s’ and sometimes the unspeakable pops through.

Patterns of industry are hardwired into us at a deeply personal level Again, particular personal collections of experience matter. We cannot adopt a professional voice as researchers, artists, or philosophers without an underlying mechanistic understanding of the world leaking into our inquiry. Deep inside, below the level I can monitor, my life is mapped out charted like a factory might be. The metaphor is ubiquitous; it is in our education system, our medical system, our economic system, our political system, even our ideas of birth, life, and death. This is a personal, cultural, and academic dilemma. There is a great need to point to this underlying lens we are taught to see though, so I offer a further metaphor:

Jam-jargon

The world of mechanism has influenced my personal identity. Somewhere deep down, I see myself as a jam-jar.

On the flickering screen of my life-plan I am haunted by an unnamed story: I am an empty glass bottle, cruising on a motorized belt. I get a dollop of raspberry preserves, then a label, and then a twist-on top. As I move along the assembly line of life, I am worked, and I am in the works, I am working. The ‘system’ is working. I am packaged, trucked, and delivered to adulthood. And at each transition the more sophisticated jamjars ask, “What are your plans?” I feel I should have an answer to this question so I point to the next slot along the clunking belt.

The jam-jar phenomenon is a repeating story. We are all jam-jars one way or another. I’ve been discussing this invisible sub-story with groups around the world for a few years. Enough to know that, while the subjectivity of my own description is just that—my own—the overall experience is a shared one. The mechanical metaphors run so deep that, without realizing it, I place the contours of my own life on the factory belt. I wish I was not a jam-jar. I wish I were able to place a patterned lens on my perception of the world that did not revert to a grid. Everything is gridded, and only sometimes can I see the symmathesy—the learning context.

We find what we are looking for

The difficulty of catching ourselves when we begin to apply mechanistic logic to living systems is not to be underestimated. I get lost. I can only occasionally see the edges. So intrinsic is this habit of assembling the blocks of life, and deciphering the cogs of its architecture, that the way I set out to make sense of things, anything, is to begin to figure out how it works.

The danger is that if I look at life in the natural world—a forest or family, a person or an organization—and I am trying to find an arrangement of parts and wholes within it, I will find it. I can probably put names to the parts and wholes, and even diagram them in a model. We find what we are trained to see—we find what we have named.

• What I will not find with that lens is the interrelational communication, learning, and contextual timbre.

• What I will not find with that lens is what is holding the system together through time and into its evolution.

Here it is, on the front page of our way forward. The term ‘system’ sits like a shiny hood ornament (car bonnet mascot) catching the sparkle of the sun and the bug guts (squashed insects) of this moment in history. Arguably, the fate of humanity is a measure of our capacity to evolve beyond the destructive patterns we are now engaged in. I would suggest that this evolution relies on the possibility that we might see our world differently—as a living process, not as a mechanism.

I grew up in a household in which a system was a living thing, alive in its swirl of interrelationships and intercommunications. A system was something I was always inside of. I am one; I live in one that is inside a bigger one, inside a bigger one—inside a bigger one. But there are not really any draw-able boundaries between them: it is messier than that. There are too many variables. A system is hard to keep alive in this languaging. A forest is not diagrammable. Neither is a family. An ecosystem, a love affair, an organization: none of these are really ‘systems.’

But in my household, unusually, a system was a warm thing.

‘Warm Systems.’ I tried that wording, hoping to make clear that I was speaking of something more than a gearing of parts. In my own work I began to use the term to show that there is a difference that makes a difference, as my father once said, in the way we use the term. I wanted so much to reclaim the word ‘system,’ to give it back the dignity of its own complexity. A warm system is a thing of elegance and grace; it should be noble. But still I felt the lack of movement.

For me, the word ‘system’ and its accompanying entourage of boxy models cannot hold the gooey ecology of what the biosemiotics experts call the ‘semiosphere.’ Google ‘systems,’ look under _resources/books//Small Arcs of Larger Circles_ Framing Thro - Nora Bateson… and you need to scroll through pages of results before you find a photograph of a living thing. There is no art there. Not a single illustration of something in relationship. Instead you will see squares and triangles, and arrows and circles—all sharp with educated and earnest attempts to code-crack life. These graphics seem to be maps that lead us right back to the school of engineering where the culture we live in first found its footing. Gregory Bateson was suspicious of using metaphors from physics to describe the living world. The other way around is not so bad, he suggested. Without doing much harm one can pat a car’s dashboard and praise its performance. But to attribute the language of physics to a living system is more toxic, because it implies ‘control’; it implies parts and wholes.

As systems research develops, we find ourselves at a junction of what is called ‘linear’ and ‘non-linear’ thinking. This is a step in the right direction, but it is important to recognize that non-linear thinking, in a world that mechanizes our imagination, often leads to a tricky masking of linear thought patterns as non-linear. Also, some early non-linear work focused on models that were an improvement on the linear model, but have revealed their own limits. One such model is the circle as a visual analogy of ecology.

More than circular

Circles have come to be the branded motto of recycling, ecology, and the cycles of living things. But, for our work, the model of circles is not enough. The cybernetic notion of circular communication, interaction, and cyclical behavior was a big step forward from pre-cybernetic, linear descriptions of these processes. The value of that progress in our thinking is not to be underestimated. Because conceptual models provide potent impressions to our comprehension, metaphors matter. While circles are a popular visual metaphor for life, the limits of the circle as metaphor are overcome in the concept of symmathesy. The notion of a symmathesy and a learning context within other contexts does not define a two-dimensional field of variables, nor does it return to where it began. A better visual might be the double helix, as the model of a learning system must have at least three dimensions (four if you count time). Gregory Bateson writes:

First, there is humility, and I propose this not as a moral principle, distasteful to a large number of people, but simply as an item of a scientific philosophy. In the period of the Industrial Revolution, perhaps the most important disaster was the enormous increase of scientific arrogance. We had discovered how to make trains and other machines. We knew how to put one box on top of the other to get that apple, and Occidental man saw himself as an autocrat with complete power over a universe, which was made of physics and chemistry. And the biological phenomena were in the end to be controlled like processes in a test tube. Evolution was the history of how organisms learned more tricks for controlling the environment; and man had better tricks than any other creature.

But that arrogant scientific philosophy is now obsolete, and in its place there is the discovery that man is only a part of larger systems and that the part can never control the whole.

—Gregory Bateson, Steps to an Ecology of Mind

Given that the tricks we have developed to ‘control the environment’ have reeled into consequences beyond our wildest dreams, we would do well to think humbly about how we are thinking. The trouble is NOT that the world has gone to hell, or that we have no idea how to save the future for our children. The trouble is at another level. The trouble is that even the advocates for peace and justice, the ecologists, and the dedicated teachers, the therapists, and the philanthropists, are still thinking in terms of parts and wholes. Even the ones that use the language of ‘systems.’

People who have devoted themselves to the deeper practice of systems thinking will say this criticism is unfair. For some, a system does not primarily refer to something arranged. But only for a few. So pervasive is the habit of applying the problem-solving methods of the engineer that the language of the entire body of systems and complexity theory has become a container for slightly higher order reductionist thinking. At least that is my experience. For several years now I have been a traveler into the groups of ‘system thinkers’ around the world: including psychologists, politicians, artists, ecologists, economists, doctors, biologists, educators, and coaches.

I will share my water test with you. Ask: Does this thinker seek to make a plan? Employ a strategy? Find a solution? Or interact with a context?

One type of thinker plots a trajectory into the future that can be controlled. The other does not consider control, but is sensitive to the aesthetic, attempting a multilayered ecological shift at the level of context. This requires a rigor of intellectual, perceptual, and emotional multiplicity and sensitivity. Developing rigor to hold variables in focus is not the same as romanticizing the blurry unknown. There is enough borderline ‘new age’ material out there now to require that I address the issue of the ‘unknown’ and ‘unknowable.’ This concept has unfortunately become a catch-all for a lack of rigor. Instead I would argue that the complexity inherent in living processes requires that we employ more rigor, not less. To take into account the larger consequences of our ‘actions’ is to better understand the many facets of our interactions.

I am not suggesting that action cannot be taken in acute situations to address an emergency quickly. Of course it is necessary to relieve pain, to avert a suicide, to eschew bankruptcy. But the larger, longer, wider response is to be scrutinized at another level. Not either/or, but both. Why is one way of looking ‘linear’ and the other ‘systemic’? What if linear was not linear at all… just over-planned, and what if ‘systemic’ was something more than an organic Swiss watch?

Delivery from the dilapidated state of the world now is not in the providence of the mechanic. There are no parts to fix. No particular manuals to write, or scripts to edit. The poverty of our description of these living things we call ‘systems’ will starve us from a future of juicy life. This concerns me. And seems so unnecessary. Perhaps a better description, inaugurated by the new term symmathesy, will give us the missing understanding we require to hold present in our thoughts the mutual learning processes of all living systems.

Do we reinterpret history and the knowledge of the past through the same grid/lens we use to interpret the institutions of knowledge now? What is the plumbing blueprint for the piping up of knowledge? What is information that has been through the jam-jar factory, stripped of its contexts, labeled, categorized, and parceled into jargons?

Symmathesy. I am one, you are one, we are within them. Learning together in context, at all scales.

Now I a fourfold vision see

And a fourfold vision is given to me

Tis fourfold in my supreme delight

And three fold in soft Beulahs night

And twofold Always. May God us keep

From Single vision & Newtons sleep

—William Blake, 1802, ‘Letter to Thomas Butts’

Part V: Implications and Applications of Symmathesy

Education, therapy, medicine, social infrastructure, interaction with the living environment, and personal life, are all premised upon our understanding of the world we live in. If that world is a world defined through mutual learning or symmathesy, here are some shifts in perception we might notice.

(Let it first be recognized that, with symmathesy in mind, we will be disinclined to draw the distinctions of this question as I have done above. To define a separation between education, therapy, social infrastructure, and personal life is a misleading fracturing of context. As a means of providing a glimpse into the possible benefits of this idea, I have listed these entities as separate because that is how they are depicted by our culture. But by no means do I see them as isolated facets of our lives.)

Education: from the perspective of symmathesy, education would look at the interconnections between what we now call disciplines or subjects. Forests are interactions, food is culture, and so on. The ability to study both the details (existing disciplines) and the relationships of learning between them will increase our students’ ability to see and interact with a level of complexity that is necessary for the survival of future generations. As it stands, our ‘knowledge’ often prevents us seeing the interdependencies in our complex world, therefore we disrupt them—to the detriment of our wellbeing and that of the biosphere we live within.

Therapy: If a living context is a mutual learning context then the way we approach a notion of ‘pathology’ is radically altered. Seen as a symmathesy, a person or a family is learning to make sense of its world. Like their bodies, emotional, mental, and interactional processes would all be included in their ways of calibrating their world (not necessarily consciously)—all pathology is also learning.

The way a symmathesy makes sense of its world is a learning process at multiple levels. But that learning is not necessarily positive or progressive in the orthodox understanding of learning. We can learn to be sick. A tree learns from its context that it needs to grow crooked. Remove the value judgment from that process and we will instead see a remarkable feat of life to survive in whatever tangle it perceives. Think of an alcoholic’s body: his skin, his metabolism, his liver, his family, his history, his communication with his friends are all revealing a mutual process of manifesting the way he makes sense of his world. Where is the pathology? In the learning.

Healing: If pathology is learning, then so is healing. The person, family, or other symmathesy will make sense of their contextual existence in another set of calibrations that create healing. What if healing and pathology are both expressions and possibilities of mutual learning? Our approach to health, then, would be to provide circumstances in which multiple aspects of life can be cultivated for an individual, a family or perhaps even a society to generate combined realms of learning, change, and healing.

IBI has been observing work on rehabilitation after paralysis and on terminal pain at the Centro Studi di Riabilitazione Neurocognitiva (CSRN) in Italy. It is a testament to another way of thinking, contrasting with a world where the ‘solution’ of a problem involves singular and direct treatment. In medicine, politics, education, economy, and even our personal lives, we measure our productivity in terms of action and reaction. It is almost as if a script runs through our culture that instructs us how to address trouble. It reads, ‘where is the problem and how do we fix it?’ This linear questioning leads to a set of responses that can only treat the problem directly, with therapies that focus specifically on the symptoms as presented. At CSRN the therapies are designed to reach behind the visible manifestation of the crisis the patient is in and ask another sort of question. Their question is: ‘How is this system making sense of its world?’ The information and influences that the clinicians at CSRN find in the pursuit of their question are qualitatively and quantitatively of another order, at another level.

The question being posed at CSRN reveals something like a stew of slow-cooked, cognitive, cultural, and relational processes that need to relearn. The ‘treatment’ then stems from a recognition that the whole person/system has to find their way to re-understanding the world they are in. This involves the enormity of the neurocognitive system, as well as the patients’ interaction with their environment and community. (Much more information on this work is available from the IBI.)

Medicine in this sense can potentially shift in its modus operandi toward becoming more a means of cultivating a learning context in which reorganization is possible and less a toolkit for tweaking the parts of a system. Obviously both are necessary. There are moments when the short view is vital, but even emergency situations might be seen differently through this lens. What is the symmathesy calibrating?

An umbrella concept that addresses the living world as a learning context offers another window through which to see, analyze, and interact with the complexity of life. This conceptual frame furthers our research agenda, offering a wider basis of relational interaction into our notion of ‘subject’ for study. The interactions within living systems and between them are many. So many in fact, that it is a daunting task for the research team to draw an outline around what might be the focus of study. But is this rigor a hindrance? Or is it perhaps the next frontier of inquiry? The multiplicity of these interactions requires us to include the crossover between multiple contexts, in which new methods of inquiry can approach the rigor of zooming our lenses of study in and out on combined processes of continual learning.

Ecology of Institutions

Much like the body in paralysis whose many systems for making sense of the world are interrupted and disorganized, our institutions appear to be equally entwined in a self-preserving holding pattern of dysfunction that stymies all attempts to instigate change, even for the survival of our species. When the question is asked in this way, ‘How is this symmathesy learning to make sense of its world?’ it becomes apparent that there is a similarity in the multi-modal and iterative processes of ‘learning to make sense’ that is comparable to the cognition systems of patients at CSRN. Like a pin ball game in which the ball is bounced between nodes of perception making connections and interconnections into learning, there is a pattern of permeated operational interactions within and between the institutions of our world. We have a context of economic, social, and cultural institutions that have learned to accommodate us as they do today, even as we have learned to accommodate them. If the question is shifted from ‘how do we fix the institutions?’ to ‘how have we learned to interact with these institutions as a context?’—we may find that our set of ‘solutions’ is much more productive.

The education system desperately needs to change in order to provide coming generations with support for their future, but the job market needs professionals who have individual skills, specialized in fragmented subjects. The economic viability of our global marketplace is hinged on an increase in production and a constant growth rate, which ties perfectly into the thrusting technological rush to invent and innovate new tools. In turn, the hurry created by these imperatives increases imbalances in the social realm that feed the need for more technology, whether this takes the form of apps for an iPhone or advances in medicine. The political system must conduct itself to serve the tempo and demands of the market, leading inevitably (though not always intentionally) to the upsurge we can see in fundamentalism, economic inequality, and the privatization of social services. Meanwhile, to support this ecology of institutions, the ecology of our biosphere is being exploited. Alongside the precious diversity of our planet, the basics of our living needs like air, water and food are in danger of being destroyed.

More research is needed, from another angle, with another methodology, and symmathesy offers a very fertile approach to explore.

What if we look at the interlocking interdependencies of our institutions as an ecology in and of itself? Ecology can be loosely defined as a totality of patterns of interrelationship that form interdependencies. In this sense, our institutions function very much like a forest or an ocean. The infrastructures of our institutions reinforce and balance one another, and our socio-economic system develops in patterns that fit the characteristics of any ecology. Are we not, in that case, contributing perfectly to an ecology that we live within? Perhaps humanity is not so un-ecological after all. The difficulty we face is in the fact that the larger ecology of the biosphere is at odds with the ecology of our institutions, and right now we believe we need both to survive.

How can this idea of contextual rehabilitation help us to address the dysfunctional and stuck interrelationships within the ecology of institutions? How can we address the context of these institutions instead of attempting to chase down the crises as separate issues?

Many vocabularies are needed to begin to grasp the multiple contexts of knowledge within a single living organism (including a thought), and such research is best approached with multiple minds in collaboration. The work of the IBI has been particularly illuminating. The unexpected gem of this group, and its surprising outcome, is the shared language with which we discuss patterns, relationship, and learning. This language is the result of our individual studies of Gregory Bateson’s work (among others). Our respective professions give us depth in a diversity of fields, which is then articulated in integration with the language of our roots in his work. The jargon of our fields is then trumped by the shared, overarching discourse of interconnection, interdependency, and interaction through relationship. We do not tend toward the subject fragmentation that many ‘interdisciplinary’ studies funnel into, which is refreshing. Our projects have enjoyed remarkable leverage with this contrast and collaboration.

A version of this essay was first published in Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the ISSS – 2015, Berlin, Germany, Vol 1, No 1 (2015).Integrity

Occasionally one runs across a taste of integrity so stark it resets the focus on how we take stock. Thinking about these words of Franz Kafka, I am impressed at his edge of self-reflection. So keen was his warning that he called out his own ambitions and laid them naked against dreams of what is meaningful. At least that is my reading. When the deep ‘you’ catches the lost ‘you’ making compromises on irretrievable qualities, you might say to yourself:

If this is what you came for, then I didn’t send for you.

—Franz Kafka (note to himself in his journal)

Who has the future-self sent for? Kafka was clever to divert the predictable, inevitable corruption of his own motivations. Is there an authority better suited to scold the hijacker of one’s history than the past-self? Brilliantly he sent himself a reminder from his former self—who swore never to sell out, never to cave in, never to convert to the religion of mediocrity. It is all too easy to slip under the spell of familiar behaviors that make normalcy out of greed, dishonesty, and manipulation. This is not the future that we thought history was aiming for.Who are we Now?

Who we were, who we are, and who we will be—these are all identities that lie on a spectrum of possibility; a spectrum that includes everything we can imagine ourselves to be.

Looking backward we can explain, authorize and claim the boundaries of our national and larger social identities. Looking through that rear-view mirror, we can justify the horror of seeking to exclude other peoples and cultures from our homes. We can say “let the Swedes be Swedish,” “keep Poland Polish,” and we can make an argument for the protection of ‘individual cultures.’

But the world is changing. This is the era of people movement. No one knows exactly how and where ecological and economic pressures will drive the millions of people who are moving. But it is certain that nothing will be as it was.

Being alive now requires us to participate in some of the most significant transformations in the history of humankind.

Being alive now also means we have the potential to make these transitions. No one will keep the culture they had 50 years ago. There is no going back. Looking ahead we must ask:

Who do we want to be in this transforming world? Who are we, now? … And what of Humanity?

History tells us it will be impossible to lay aside our habits of exploitation and warlike behavior. But history also tells us that humanity is capable of remarkable adaptive improvisation.

The question now is not whether we can handle rapid culture change as our ecology, economy, and national and international political structures transform.

The question is how to get better at it, together. But it’s clear that the first step is not to seek to standardize, average out, and assimilate, but to recognize complexity.

Starting with how I see my self and how I see others:

I will not make you into Kafka’s cockroach.

I will not limit you.

I will not presume.

It seems to me the ultimate act of love is to allow ourselves and others to be complex. In affection and respect, I try never to pin down, sum up, pigeon-hole, label, or otherwise reduce myself or any other living system to a singular tag.

You are a horizon of always re-shaping forms, falling in and out of the puzzle of your own cohesion. We are all as fragmented as a Picasso. And we are also as whole as life.

You have one name, one pair of eyes, but you are more than one identity—more than twenty identities. More than we can count. My description of you will be wall-less.

We don’t lose one part of us when we accept the other parts. We can be both local and global, individual and communal. We are like one another in that we are complex, though the stories of our lives may be in sharp contrast. Singularity of identity no longer serves us. Zoom in, zoom out. Both.

Cultural confusion is the healthy recognition that there is more than one way to think about something. Whereas cultural misunderstanding is the rigid certainty about ourselves and others that precludes the possibility of mutual learning. It is the idea that one of us must be right.

Sometimes it takes years to even begin to see for ourselves why we make the decisions we do. To make out the many elements and aspects that form us is like reading poetry.

It is emotion and intellect, language and culture, but the meaning is different for each reader, each day, in each context.

Who are we now?Filmmaking in the Tide-Pools

Learning is an intimate process; a tender shuffle of shifting contexts within, rearranging the paths before and behind us. Learning is vulnerable; it is the open anemones at low tide, whose tentacles are surrendered to the current. Learning is sadness and a sudden alone moment holding a found key to an unknown house. Learning is relationship, exponentially.

The exponents repeat and interrupt in an edgeless orgy of combinations. I am somewhere in the process, but it is impossible to pinpoint where. Am I the student? The teacher? Am I learning this now, or did I learn this before? What was necessary to build a nest for this new learning? The preparation for this might have taken a lifetime. Did it come from books? From the pain of life? Or did it beam down and just slip between the notes of a moving piece of music?

And what are we taught? What can we teach? A sacred mastery cannot justify the hubris of insisting on the direction of another person’s internal landscape evolution. So what then is the relationship that learning itself seeks? What is the climate of attraction or the timing of a ripening thought? What is the alchemy of contact such that insight is a lightning bolt shooting upward that is met by the flash of inspiration on its way down?

How do we take part in the process that leads to that sentiment? We ask, as teachers or as students, what makes it happen?

During the years that I was making the documentary about my father, ‘An Ecology of Mind,’ I took these questions to heart, and into the editing room. What is an educational film anyway, if not a wandering into the learning of the filmmaker? Thank goodness I was innocent as to how hard it was going to be. As T.S. Eliot says, “A condition of complete simplicity, costing not less than everything, and all shall be well….” And that is about what it took, maybe more than everything—including all my savings, and excruciating self-reflections. But, in the end I was victorious; I learned what I already knew. I have learned about learning to learn, and to never stop.

I have been screening the film I made about my father around the world for countless audiences. What amazes me is that even after having seen the film hundreds of times, I still learn from it. Although I shot a good deal of it, wrote it, and edited it—something new still surfaces with each viewing. How is that possible? I wonder if maybe I am simply finding an hour of comfort in the minutes of the film that float by, minutes I know, dialogue I know, a loving familiarity perhaps? But why not excruciating boredom?

I notice things now. Five years of going over the footage second by second, arranging and rearranging it, was not enough. I also had to try it out, second by second against music, then retry it, in with another framing of shots, other rhythms. Somehow that still was not enough. I also worked with my dear editor David, who had never heard of Bateson, and he told me when things stopped making sense to him.

There is something in learning that requires discipline, comparison, and careful closeness. But, the zoom-in can become rigid. Tectonic shifts are part of this too.

I learned to see my father through the lens he taught me to look at the world with. In order to do that I went into a sort of Edgar Morin reflexive house of mirrors exercise.

I learned to see his way of seeing me,

through my thinking patterns,

through the edits,

and the compositions of ideas

I was forming.

Through my filmic descriptions, I saw my perception.

But that was also not enough, so I waited. I was elated, I was devastated. I was hopeful, I was mortified. I had to wait between sessions of editing because they are shockingly expensive and I had to find time and money between sessions to return to the project.

Stillness was mandatory.

At the time I was editing my film, my own children were small, 9 and 11. Exactly the age I am in the tide-pool footage in the film. The long hours spent in editing rooms watching old footage and listening to conversations that my father and I shared brought the cadence of our particular version of mutual learning into focus.

The way we exchanged ideas included a color spectrum. The array of tones was of far greater measure in its value than the ideas. The hues made the ideas possible. The enfolding of the parent/child relationships, the language of the intergenerational inquiry, and the depth of the respect. Jumpy light was projected at 24 frames a second across walls of memory and the walls between life and death. 30 years after his death I am now both daughter and mother. Recollected moments and flickering footage snapped loose the resistance I had mustered. I began to dissolve. I found a voice. I was the filmmaker. I was learning. I also found the mother I wanted to be.

The film that would one day be, required that in the mid-70s we went poking around in tide-pools finding the form and process of life for the curious creatures we found. I still remember the freezing cold Pacific waves on my ankles.

I felt the child that I once was could now inform me in my tasks as a parent. The gentle push of my father to stand outside the expectations of our scripted idea of parenting and be a human being. Forget the nonsense of: “because I am older than you and you should treat me with respect.” Instead, remember the ecology of the relationship. What is the complex field of influences in which what you are about to say will take seed? What are the aspects of this interaction that are infinite? How does this drop of paint look on the canvas in 10 years’ time?

I needed time to integrate the remembering I was doing. I needed room to find the film in my memory, to remember how it would look.

I had forgotten so much.

I had to taste the textures of those interactions, and to hold them like a shield against the boxed communication patterns of our culture.

I knew it could be different, I just forgot the music of it for a decade or two.

Through my children I met with the membrane between the script of parenthood and the possibility of mutual learning: mutual respect.

If I had finished the film earlier I think it would have had an ending. The quietude I had between sessions gave abduction time to work. I had to remember what abduction was, not as a theory, but as a life-habit. Abduction is a tool for thinking that allows us to use our ability to compare patterns. With this tool we can look at the life-cycle of a tree in a forest and use our observations to inform our understanding of our own life-cycles.

I was remembering a future I had lost in the decades between the time my father died and the time I plunged into the film project. Small sleeping cells of knowing were slowly warming. It was a time of thawing the cold protection I had encased myself in, so that I could stand fiercely in the tsunami of bullshit the education system in the US dishes out. He was my ally, my island of sanity. When he was gone I did not have any backup. In the time after Gregory died, I had to find a little place where I could just pretend to be normal, and for a few years buy in to the idea that the teachers were right, that the program mattered, that there was a formula for success… and in fact that there was such a thing as success.

The goal is not a home and car and published book. Rather, to do good, as Blake said, “in minute particulars,” and cause as little damage as possible in the process. It sounds easier than it is. I have learned a bit now about my father’s loneliness. With no discipline to belong in, no club, no brand, no circle in which to identify, his work required courage—and a dog.

I was alone in the world of ideas we opened together. Instead of scholastic achievement, this idea world bred mischievous rebelliousness. If I did not shut it down, the punk rocker would surface. It was not until I found the lightness in my father’s tone, the devilish humor with which he carried his crucial blow to the status quo, that I was able to allow that part of me to ‘be’ again.

I watch him smirk a little in the archival footage, and then delight in the cracking edges between what he has just said and the formal institutional barriers to the thinking he is presenting… he is a prankster. A comedian, a magnet.

But this is play, and it is serious. It is play that is underscored by a fierce courage. Courage that is rooted, nested, and revealed only through a level of affection for life that I have never seen in another person the way I see it in my father. To play with the patterns that form in our perception is a gesture of trust. The playful rebellion is reckless, but not numb. There is only one motivation for such questioning, and that is the impulse to revel in the beauty of the impossible complexity of life. The alternative to trust is not doubt, but rigid control.

So when I watch the film for the umpteenth time, that is what I am studying. It is not the theory, not the vocabulary, not even the concepts… not the golden eggs. I am just seeing the goose.

The world as it is—is filled with errors. Errors in perception, errors in application. Errors of misjudged boundaries between mistaken parts, and unseen wholes. The fragments do not combine to form a whole that resembles unity—they merge into a mosaic of brokenness. We cannot put Humpty Dumpty back together.

The lines we have drawn and the damage those lines have incited are there now. They are part of our context, part of the narrative we will coevolve in. They are the torn wounds of nature burning with pain and stinging with the same betrayal we know from our own accidents. Human injury, too, is ours. Compensatory limping in our movement, politically, economically, personally, ecologically. Balancing will now include the disruption we are within. We cannot erase it, or cure it, or fix it.

In the fissures where the sharp edges of our fragmentation have cut through the tissue of togetherness and left it to bleed, the patterns of our perception crave play. A jiggle of the boundaries in our descriptions is what eases the unseen, unwanted, and uncomfortable. Gregory said, if you are depressed, read the classics, read Shakespeare. The classics demand that you work a little bit to see through another lens.

This pain from these fissures is multi-causal and in the complexity, is it not? This pain is in the ecology of our learning. And if it is in an ecology of ideas, that means there is life, it is not static. We are not stuck, if we opt to be unstuck.

Optional hope. Learning. In our ever-evolving understanding of our world, which frame will we take up? Which language? Blake asked, “what immortal hand or eye dare frame thy fearful symmetry?” How shall we find what we don’t know we are looking for? We have never seen it before, never said it before. How shall we remember?

Like choosing clips in the editing room to describe my father, there are so many entangled directions of the story. Each choice is one among many. There are so many harmonies to listen for.

Is the pain avoidable? Or are we better off now to ask if perhaps the pain was worth it? How high will the price be for a shift in the imagination we use to perceive our world? How many editing sessions did it take before I stopped trying to make a ‘biography’ of my father?

At what point did I stop trying to make a film about an important scientist in the language of television, and begin to include the wide swaths of what I do not know about my father.

At what point did I learn to describe a living system and notice that in this case the living system in question was my father? I do not know. I did not want to make a film that would effectively sum him up and kill him. I wanted to open doors, not close them. That requires opting for another kind of description.

I learned, when I began to remember what lay ahead, that it is in the space behind the details that the interaction takes on its aesthetic. That, for example, when Gregory asks things like, “what is the pattern that connects?”—he is inviting us to make another order of comparisons, to reach though the trivial and arbitrary into the underbelly of the system and grope. If we try to arrange things and to apply the laws of physics to the world of living systems, we will make more errors.

But to go about life with a step-by-step plan, a strategy, a formula for change, or an action agenda—is a recipe for disaster. These patterns we face now are inside us. There is no ‘out there.’

There is not a place to point at that does not point back to us. Us, not me, not you. Us.

To bash and scream in anger, whether or not it involves logical analysis, is useless. Now we find riddles, now we play, now with all the love we can muster, we seek the behind layers. Without a sense of humor our findings will be hideous. Without release of the affection we hoard from each other, we lose our rhythm in the dance. That is what I learned, among other things….

But I am still learning.

Christmas this year feels to me like a clock. The months seem to circle round through the icy puddles to the shameless blooms of spring, up and over into the tall dry grass in warm summer, and tilting back lands us in the rustle of earth-toned leaves and returns us to the itchy comfort of a wool scarf pulled tight against the chill. Christmas in Bruges.

The past is so present in Bruges. Buildings dating from the 12th to the 18th century are stacked up. Long necked swans glide in the canals. Arched bridges make reflections of luminous ellipses and tall clock towers mark the centuries—one Christmas at a time. I think it might always be Christmas here. The chocolates never stop and the beer always flows. Time here jingles like change in the pocket of history—I hope the future will spend it wisely. The contrast of our moment against this backdrop is a reminder of a kind of thinking, an aesthetic, a way of organizing that kept a loose enough humor, in a tight enough weave of time… it lasts that way.Ink

Window shopping through the endless array of symbolic, humorous _resources/books//Small Arcs of Larger Circles_ Framing Thro - Nora Bateson in my mind’s library, I enjoy imagining possible choices for my own tattoo, if I were to get one. The rebellious artistic scream of tattoos is attractive to me. Even so, I cannot figure out how I could ever choose one and remain committed to it. I am afraid there is no symbol that I could stand behind for the rest of my days in this skin.

Of course there have been times of surety throughout my life, when I really knew who I was. Hindsight renders those times embarrassing now. Looking back, I see that the moments of certainty reek of head-held-high foolishness. Perhaps in my old age I will know more, but thus far those bolts of existential clarity are ephemeral at best. Perhaps on those illusory days I could have inked a tattoo of my certainty. Such times of certainty have passed: I learn in new ways, my vision expands. What would that tattoo symbolize now, had I claimed it? Perhaps it would serve not so much as a mascot, but as a reminder of how the horizon of self moves.

I cannot imagine now that I will ever stop stretching the outlines of learning. I do not want to stop. Aesthetic, emotional, and conceptual centerpieces are eclipsed by seeing broader contexts. I suppose I have a commitment to the momentum of that learning. Can that be tattooed?

This book contains my words in the architecture of the written page. Ink is eager to draw language around findings and hold them still. Some words will still fit a decade or two from now, others may grow tight. Either way I do not share the desire to define myself in the stain of the written word.

I would like to protect all living, growing, evolving processes from the violence of being freeze-framed. I stand by the dignity of living complexity. Yet complexity is delicate and dangerous to defend. The many variables of life are always in interaction, producing unpredictable changes and co-evolutions. Changing our opinions and epistemological baseline within this learning matrix makes us look like capricious, shallow flip-floppers.

I like to change my mind. It shows me I have learned something. Bumper stickers don’t last as long as tattoos, they are not as intimate. I once saw a bumper sticker on the back of a car in Berkeley, CA that said, “If you can’t change your mind, are you sure you still have one?”

As time and context continue on, words, like artifacts, just sit there. Print is difficult to evolve, but writing is another thing. It is a process that reveals and forms discoveries through new discoveries. I like words, as I like _resources/books//Small Arcs of Larger Circles_ Framing Thro - Nora Bateson. Words are the carriers of formed droplets of discovery. They are paint, they are ingredients, a palette to brush _resources/books//Small Arcs of Larger Circles_ Framing Thro - Nora Bateson into ideas and melt intellect into emotion. There is nothing wrong with words.

I am worried that these printed words will render themselves obsolete. In years to come they will still be smattered around on pages, refusing to stand down when they are too small for the next larger knowing that inevitably arises. I would keep editing them along the way if the words were still mine to tweak. But, by then they will not be in my care. They go out and find trouble in the world, and I do not want to be liable for their behavior.

Ironically, what I write will speak of who I am. I know I cannot stop the stamp my printed words will make on my identity. I resent that. Authors often hide full manuscripts under the bed and never publish them, for good reason. I am afraid of the words in these pages; afraid they will tattoo me. I am not sure I want to lay them down. I am not sure I can stand behind them in times to come.

Working and playing with the complex living world requires multiple languages, multiple ways of knowing, and multiple emotions. To find a voice in this territory is to claim the use of more than one voice—to pull poetry across science and tell stories with research. If I publish poetry, will I never have a voice in the annals of theory or science? If I write in the voice of science and psychology, will I be less of an artist? I cannot risk the loss that will come with a monotonous, mono-cropped engagement with discoveries in complexity. Instead, I have endeavored to risk everything else, including my credibility and professional identity, in the interest of discovering my own complexity. Having done so, the next task is to risk it all again.References

Somewhere in between stillness and movement there is a flickering, almost imperceptible flashpoint. That slippery, timeless moment suggests a memory of what is to come.

Gregory wrote this story while on retreat at The Hermitage in Big Sur in 1979. It was first published in Co-Evolution Quarterly. I have included it here to let it speak to opposing approaches to describing the world. Let them flirt shamelessly with each other. Some are in long-term relationships. For example:

Religion and science

Technology and art

Measurement and intuition.

Alfred North Whitehead talked about the “fallacy of misplaced concreteness.” Claim any one of these ways of describing the world as alone able to offer true understanding and the flicker is lost, the rope is slack, and meaning escapes like a clever prisoner.

In this story my father makes a case for the tension, and the frustration in the love story of the push/pull between:

Body and mind

Ancient and contemporary

Wild and tamed

Certainty and uncertainty.

But these are couples, not binaries. They bicker. They long. They are in conversations that relentlessly lead us up and down paths that map into double helixes. In relationships, boundaries are interfaces of interaction that offer paradoxes for breakfast. Beautiful and boggling co-existence requires resting in inquiry: It is both necessary and impossible to point to details and to rest in the foundations of life. With each perspective responding to responses in infinite iterations, the alchemy of influences is saturating and expressing continuously. Interdependence is communicational, mutual learning (symmathesy). And as the observer here, my own framing is an offering of my own mythology. I see a love story—everywhere.

* * *

There was once a beautiful lady, whose habit it was to sleep on disused railroad tracks.

In that same country there lived also a brutal surveyor who ran the trains up and down the tracks. He was at heart an explorer and therefore was particularly attracted by those branches of the railroad system where no trains had passed within living memory. These were precisely those tracks where the lady delighted to slumber.

So it happened over and over again that she would be disturbed in her sleep and compelled to retreat hastily while a powerful and smelly engine dashed over the very place she had been happily resting.

Every time this happened there was a falling out between the lady and the gentleman. He maintained that she was an old- fashioned, trivial, and superstitious thing. She, in return, would spit out insults in a quite unladylike manner saying that he was indeed a thing, subhuman, and nothing but a small boy interested only in silly noisy toys.

And so it went on. For about two thousand years she would always be finding new and unexplored parts of the railroad system upon which to sleep and he always choosing those very branches of the tracks for the exercise of his monstrous vehicles.

He asserted that it was his right - and even duty - to map the railroad system and that the whole system was entirely his - especially the unexplored parts of it. He argued that the system was a single, entirely logical-causal network of tracks.

She averred that the tracks were designed for the rest and peace of the human soul and cared nothing for his dreams of causality and logic.

He mapped every detail of the tracks along which he ran his engines. She continually found other parts of the system not yet mapped.

One day the engineer carelessly left one of his maps beside the track and the lady found it. Gingerly, holding it only with the tips of her fingers, she picked it up. She handled it as if it had been left there by the devil.

It was curiosity that led her to open the map, unwilling to see what it might contain and therefore not really looking at its details. Looking at this from a distance through half-shut eyes, she was surprised to find that thus half-seen, the document was in itself beautiful.

At the next confrontation between herself and the engineer she said without thinking, “And you don’t even know that your own maps are beautiful.”

At this the surveyor was amazed. He gruffly replied that he was not interested in that.

She said to herself, “Ah, then there is something in the universe in which he is not interested. That something belongs to me.”

“For ever,” she said.

After they parted, each considered what had been said. The surveyor was forced to agree that indeed the beauty of his maps and correspondingly the beauty of the railroad tracks were not within his province. She, on the other hand, was delighted and hugged to herself the secret knowledge that he would never invade what she most valued—the elegance and symmetry of the total system. Not its details but its foundations.

At their next meeting he asked whether she was still interested in the so-called beauty of the maps. When she rather defensively replied in the affirmative, he said in an offhand manner that he had perhaps something to show her.

He then confessed that while she slept upon the railroad tracks he had come quietly and had made a careful drawing of her body. It was this drawing that he wanted to show her.

He unfolded and placed side by side before her his map of the railroad tracks and his drawing. He said it was “scientifically interesting” that the map and the drawing appeared to resemble each other in many “formal” characteristics. He specially wanted her to see this strange resemblance between the two documents.

She briefly dismissed the matter. She said she had always known that. But, saying this, she looked away and smiled.
