# A Citizen’s Guide to the Political Psychology of Voting

In the run-up to a contentious 2020 presidential election, the much-maligned American voter may indeed be wondering, “How did we get here?” _A Citizen’s Guide to the Political Psychology of Voting_ offers a way of thinking about how voters make decisions that provides both hope and concern. In many ways, voters may be able to effectively process vast amounts of information in order to decide which candidates to vote for in concert with their ideas, values, and priorities. But human limitations in information processing must give us pause. While we all might think we want to be rational information processors, political psychologists recognize that most of the time we do not have the time or the motivation to do so. The question is, can voters do a “good enough” job even if they fail to account for everything during the campaign? Evidence suggests that they can, but it isn’t easy. Here, Redlawsk and Habegger portray a wide variety of voter styles and approaches—from the most motivated and engaged to the farthest removed and disenchanted—in vignettes that connect the long tradition of voter survey research to real life voting challenges. They explore how voters search for political information and make use of it in evaluating candidates and their positions. Ultimately, they find that American voters are reasonably competent in making well-enough informed vote choices efficiently and responsibly. For citizen voters as well as students and scholars, these results should encourage regular turnout for elections now and in the future.

# 1The Political Psychology of Voting]]

Perhaps the first sign that Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign was more uncertain about the outcome than they let on came just a day before the election, when the campaign cancelled its celebratory fireworks over New York City’s Hudson River. No official announcement was made, and in the frenzy of nearly unanimous agreement among pundits and polls that she would be elected the first woman president, a simple NBC News report was little noticed.[^1]

As we all now know, the November 8, 2016 presidential election resulted in a shock to those same pundits and pollsters, when Donald J. Trump bested Clinton in the Electoral College to win the presidency. He eked out his win by the narrowest of margins in three key states: Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, as well as taking a number of other toss-up states. Despite winning about 2.9 million more votes than Trump, Clinton was relegated to the spectator seats next to former president Bill Clinton as Trump was sworn in on January 20, 2017.

Every time there is an election, there are winners and there are losers. And there are the voters who get to make that choice. The purpose of this book is less to talk about any specific election—even the election of 2016—than it is to try to understand the voters who make these decisions. Election campaigns are complicated, multi-player games, with campaigns devising and revising strategies, responding to opponents, and reaching out in both obvious and hidden ways to voters. There is much to be said about campaign strategies and about why Donald Trump won his Electoral College victory while Hillary Clinton bested him in the popular vote.

But our intuition is that most of what is written in the coming years will teach us that voting behavior in 2016 was not particularly unique, or even all that odd. While no one can argue that the outcome was expected, or that the information environment did not have some unusual elements, voters—as human beings—haven’t changed just because the 2016 campaign might have been extraordinary. Our plan here, then, is to focus on voters; how they use information to evaluate candidates and make their decisions, how they think and feel about politics, and how they do so within an information environment defined by the campaigns.

Our examination of the political psychology of voter behavior cannot help but touch on campaigns, since they create the bulk of the information environment in which voters operate. So along the way we will use the 2016 presidential election for many of our examples, but for the most part these examples will show how 2016 represented more continuity than change in terms of voting behavior. Our primary goal in this book is to distill and translate the existing literature on how voters decide into a broader understanding of voter behavior in the early twenty-first century not tied to any one election campaign.

## Why Voters?

Voting is the essence of democracy. Without the vote, none of us can hold our representatives accountable; in fact, we wouldn’t even have representatives. With the vote, we can readily remove those elected to act for the public when they fail to do so and replace them with others who will, at least in theory. And yet, in many American elections, voters are at least as likely to stay home as they are to show up at the polls. There are many reasons for this, including the simple fact that politics often does not seem central to most citizens’ lives. An exception to this might be an election for a high-profile office such as president, where the overwhelming attention of the media makes the campaign hard to avoid, even for the most dedicated non-voter. But the daily reality for most of our fellow Americans is one of putting food on the table, hoping the car starts to get to the job, and making sure the kids are all right. Politics—and voting—simply do not seem nearly as important as getting through the day-to-day challenges of living.

Political scientists have routinely rued this reality, expecting the average citizen to be as engaged in the political process as they themselves are. From the earliest voting studies, researchers have told us that citizens pay little attention to politics and are uninformed about their choices, and thus are at risk of being unable to hold their representatives to account even if they wanted to. And this is just research about people who actually _do_ vote. Non-voters are thought to be all this and more: simply disconnected from the complexities of politics and voting, uninterested and completely uninformed.

For many citizens, voting may be the only overt act that supports the continuation of a democratic system. Scholars have systematically studied voting from almost the beginning of the discipline of political science, with an early focus on when and why people turn out to vote. The earliest political science experiment, conducted in 1927, was designed to understand how to increase turnout.[^2] With the rise of survey research and other techniques for directly observing voters, research rapidly expanded beyond the questions of who votes to encompass the processes that underpin the vote choice. Why do people choose the candidates they do? Early survey-based studies, like _The American Voter_ in 1960, suggested that even citizens who vote are “ideologically innocent,” with most unable to even identify which political party is “left” and which is “right.” As a result, vote choices are not well grounded in the issues of the day. Instead, most voters simply consider the “nature of the times” as they make their decision or follow the preferences of others in their social groups. In short, study after study has found that voters are not particularly competent in the art of democracy.

In a representative democracy like the United States, the purpose of voting is to hold representatives accountable. For that to happen, voters must know who the candidates are, know where those candidates stand on the issues, and have and know their own preferences on the same issues. They must make their vote decisions grounded in a correspondence between their own preferences and those of the candidates. This is a pretty high bar, especially when we add in the expectation that voters must be well informed on the full range of issues at stake in any given election. It is a bar that few, if any, voters can actually reach. The political world is simply too complex, with too many moving parts, for anyone to be fully informed.

A different perspective on voter capacity has been advanced by many political psychologists. A major focus of this research suggests that voters can do a reasonable job of electoral decision-making without being fully informed. This view sees voters in general as competent enough to make accurate assessments of candidates even if they do not know everything about everything (or even a lot). Rather than needing to be demonic processors, able to absorb and process an almost infinite amount of information, voters make use of information processing strategies that may not be always optimal but are often “good enough.” Voters are motivated by both a desire to do a good job and to get the job done as quickly as possible with as little cognitive (thinking) effort as needed.[^3] While these two motivations generally conflict, there are a number of ways in which citizens can lessen the conflict and do a reasonable job of finding the candidate who best meets their interests most of the time. Throughout this book, we hope to show how that gets done, but also make clear where it can fail.

## The Lau and Redlawsk Framework

Much of the grounding for this book comes from original research carried out by David Redlawsk and Richard Lau, highlighted in their 2006 book, _How Voters Decide_. That book proposes an information processing framework of voting, arguing that voter decision-making is best understood as a process, rather than a decision made at a single point in time. The process of voter decision-making is influenced by a number of factors, as summarized in the framework reproduced here in Figure 1.1]].

![[2.jpeg]]

Figure 1.1Process-oriented Framework for Studying Voter Decision-making

_Note_: Adapted from Richard R. Lau and David P. Redlawsk, _How Voters Decide_ (2006, New York, Cambridge University Press), 22. Used with permission.

The framework begins with the voter, who is a product of various **Background Characteristics**, such as age, race, gender, partisanship, ideology, and so on, but also includes factors such as personality traits, predispositions toward political figures and policies, and more. For many commentators not interested in the _process_ of voter decision-making, assessments of how voters choose generally stop here. Analysts tell us, for example, that certain racial groups vote in specific ways, and that partisanship drives most American general elections. But such analyses do not really get at the questions of _why_ voters do what they do, except in rather superficial ways.

Our framework goes beyond this simple voter-focused approach. It recognizes that a number of factors outside of the voter’s control influence not just what the voter decides, but how she makes her decision. By extension, these factors then influence not just the evaluations and choice the voter makes, but her ability to do a “good job.” We’ll describe this framework in more detail in the next chapter. For now, we want to note that it provides an important starting point for modern political psychology conceptions of voter decision-making. It sees voters as critical, but also tells us that the environment in which they operate matters as well—maybe even just as much.

The **Decision Task** label summarizes the intersection of the **Campaign Factors**—such as the number of candidates on the ballot, the distinctiveness of those candidates, whether an election is partisan or not, the amount of information available to voters, and so on—and voter background characteristics. These combine to determine how hard or easy the decision task is for any given voter (which we will call the **political environment** in Chapter 3]]), and thus help determine what kind of **Information Processing** strategy the voter will use to evaluate the candidates and make a choice. Finally, the framework includes assessments of how good a job voters do, labeled as **Vote Choice & Quality**.

As we work our way through the political psychology of voting, we will follow this framework, but we will also go beyond it. In the late 1980s and 1990s, most political psychologists interested in voting were thinking about _thinking_, working in the cognitive tradition of information processing. This approach was influenced by ideas in cognitive psychology, social psychology, and computer science. It used the computer, with its input, processing, and output subsystems, as a general model of human information processing. The processing subsystem was a black box to be examined using observation and experiments that would allow us to learn how voters made their choices. An early example of this approach was Stanley Kelley and Thad Mirer’s “Simple Act of Voting” model from 1974, which argued that voters make their decisions only when it comes time to vote. Voters do this by recalling from memory whatever candidate information they can bring to mind, evaluating it, and then deciding which candidate has the more positive evaluation. Voters weigh the information they learn about their choices and pick the best one. This is a cognitive process, relying on memory stores (much like computer memory) and bringing information into working memory (like a computer’s central processing unit) to process.

The strength of the cognitive approach was that it recognized that voting is a process. The key weakness might be obvious even to the non-psychologist. While thinking may well be engaged during a political campaign, _feeling_ may be engaged even more. The intensity of the 2016 presidential campaign certainly provides evidence of that. Political psychologists learned that they needed to consider the role emotion plays in voter decision-making, just as much as they needed to consider cognition. More recent approaches to the political psychology of voting have considered models that combine both cognition and emotion in reciprocal processes, where each may influence the other. While in many respects this research is relatively new, building on exciting work in the neuroscience of emotions, it stems from very old ideas.

How old? One scholar of emotions identifies the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle as perhaps the first to see how emotions and thinking might be intertwined: “Aristotle suggested that people are made angry by the thought that they had been unfairly slighted.”[^4] That is, people see that they are being slighted and, in seeing this (and thus cognitively processing it), they become angry. This idea, that emotions are generated by cognitive appraisals of situations, is not the only theory of emotions debated in psychology, but, for our purposes, it is quite useful. It suggests that, in politics, for example, emotions can be aroused by what candidates say about their policies, about themselves, and about their opponents. Importantly, these emotions—such as enthusiasm or anxiety—then have consequences for how _new_ information about the candidates and campaign is processed. We are not the cool, emotionless, comprehensive calculators that some versions of rationality require. But neither are emotions in politics disconnected from what we actually perceive to be happening. It is possible to feel an emotional response—let’s say fear, for example—before we actually perceive the snake lying just in front of us on the hiking trail. In this way, emotions might be separate from cognition, causing us to react before we even know why. But in the context of voting, emotions and cognitions appear likely to be intertwined. There are important debates on this point, and different ways of seeing emotion in politics. But few would deny they are important, as we will outline in more detail later in Chapter 8]].

## The Role of Classic Research in Voter Decision-making

Combining the cognitive and emotional approaches to politics completes a process-oriented view of voting. But we should not be so quick to just ignore the work that came before. Sometimes the building blocks of later theories turn out to be pretty enduring on their own. Isaac Newton, discoverer of gravity and so many other core principles of physical science, once wrote “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” This is just as true in voter decision-making research as in any other field. The foundational work of those who come before is often critical to the newest theories of the day. For us, the work of a group of sociologists who did the first systematic studies of voters may have been prescient.[^5] They focused on the role social groups play in voting, looking at how the groups with which we affiliate influence our political choices. The idea is summarized fairly easily: Political attitudes are driven by the interactions we have with others in our group, and members of groups in general had consistent beliefs. Sometimes, however, we belong to cross-cutting groups, where one might be Democratic leaning (for example, at the time, Catholics were generally Democrats) and another might be Republican. So, wealthy Catholics were thought to be cross-pressured, and their vote less easily predicted.

In the original framework of _How Voters Decide_, this aspect of voting is subsumed into voter background characteristics and was for the most part ignored. As we will see in Chapter 6]], social groups explanations of voting have made a comeback under a new guise as social identity. The newer conception of social identity is all about how the multiple social identities with which we imbue ourselves intersect with politics to drive what seems to be an ever-polarizing partisanship in American politics.

Much of the neglect of identity was due to the influence of another foundational work, _The American Voter_, which appeared in 1960.[^6] Angus Campbell and his coauthors relegated social groups to a bit of an afterthought—and a negative one at that—in order to highlight the importance of partisan identification. As developed by the social psychologists who authored the book, partisanship is an enduring attachment to political parties, generally learned at the knees of our parents. It acts as a perceptual screen through which American politics is viewed, rather than simply as a background characteristic. Partisanship directly influences perceptions of candidates, campaigns, and the issues.

For Campbell and his colleagues, this was not a good thing. While most American voters were partisans in the 1950s when this research was done, even most partisans had very shallow understandings of politics. In fact, _The American Voter_ found that only a very small share of the public—about 12 percent—even approached politics with any kind of ideological understanding. Why did this matter? Because, the ability to understand political issues in depth and think ideologically was thought to be necessary for citizens to hold their representatives accountable at the voting booth. Campbell and his coauthors called this “ideological constraint,” which simply means that, if you hold a liberal position on one issue, you should consistently hold liberal positions on a full range of issues, and you should understand that, in general, Democratic politicians also hold liberal positions. Yet, few voters showed such sophistication in _The American Voter_ studies. Instead, they reported issue preferences that regularly crossed ideological lines, had no preference at all on many issues, and were unable to name the parties as liberal and conservative. These scholars thought ideological voters were the best kind, but there were not very many of them.

The authors of _The American Voter_ viewed group-oriented voters as less competent than ideological voters, mostly following the dictates of some organization or social group with which they were affiliated. More than 40 percent of American voters fit into this category in 1960, so groups clearly were important, but not in a positive way. Group voters evidenced less understanding of politics than ideological voters. For a third category of voters, political preference was more about simple assessments of whether the “times” were good or bad. If times were bad, they would take it out on the incumbent party, voting for the other side. But in good times, they would simply continue to accept the party in power. For these voters, ideology does not guide their decisions, nor do they recognize the role that groups play in politics.

The least competent group of voters were labeled “no issue content,” and made up just under 25 percent of voters. When asked about politics, these citizens showed no comprehension of issues, ideology, party stances, or group identity. Instead, they seemed to base their vote on candidate personalities—who they simply liked or disliked—without giving any noticeable thought to anything deeper. For researchers who though it necessary to understand the issues of the day, such voters had no chance of living up to democratic ideals.

No matter the type of American voter, partisanship infused everything in _The American Voter_. Partisanship was not specifically issue-based, and so had the potential to interfere with voters’ accurately assessing the political world. As a psychological attachment, it was an overarching group identity around which American politics is structured.

## Conclusion

The earlier work by Berelson and his colleagues, with its group-oriented perspective, was essentially _descriptive_, explaining what American politics looked like, but not assessing whether voters were competent or not. _The American Voter_ was also descriptive in its assessment of voter types, but it was _prescriptive_ as well, in telling us which kind of voter was best (ideological) and which was worst (no issue content). This perspective took hold, and given that much of the evidence strongly suggested voter incompetence, political scientists spent much of the next two decades debating the degree to which voters were or were not capable of understanding and responding to political issues.[^7]

The voter competence debates missed some important aspects of the psychology of voting. First, whether voters actually care about issues seems to depend on how candidates and political commentators talk about those issues. When particular issues are emphasized, voters respond; when they are not, voters know relatively little about them. This makes sense. Most people cannot pay as much attention to politics as political scientists, so most people cannot be expected to know as much as political scientists say they should. As we will detail in Chapter 3]], the nature of the political environment plays a critical role in structuring information that voters have available as they make their choices.

Second, in many respects _The American Voter_ asked citizens to be more than they could be, to carefully examine political information and become fully informed about the options in front of them. Ideological voters were supposedly something like that.[^8] We don’t know about you, but our parents always told us to be calm, cool, and collected when we made a decision. They may have actually and explicitly said we needed to be “rational.” Rationality has a specific meaning to political psychologists, representing the process voters should follow to make decisions. Rationality is not unique to voting, of course, but it became a dominant approach to identifying how voters might make the “right” choices. In Chapters 4]] and [^5], we will examine rationality from several perspectives and ask if it really is as good as it sounds. Maybe we will find that our parents were wrong. But in order to assess it, we must have a way to know if voters are making the “right” choices, what could be called **voting correctly**, or matching their values to the candidate who represents them most accurately. Previous research shows that many more voters do so than we might have expected after reading _The American Voter_.[^9] But they do not necessarily do so by being rational.

In fact, some research suggests that voters can do a pretty good job at voting because the political environment is predictable, voters get a lot of political information simply through their daily lives, and doing a “good enough” job is all that is needed. This idea of doing “good enough” comes from Nobel Prize-winning economist Herbert Simon, who argued that rationality does not require making the choice that maximizes accuracy, but instead only making a choice that is good enough to allow survival. In political science, the idea that voters can do a good job by using the shortcuts of daily life was the theme of Samuel Popkin’s 1991 book, _The Reasoning Voter_. As we’ll examine first in Chapter 5]], and then in Chapter 7]], these perspectives take to heart the idea that human beings have cognitive limitations that make complex decision-making challenging. We can only process small amounts of information at any given time, we make mistakes about the payoffs we can expect from a given choice, and we are subject to a wide range of potential biases. The very clear takeaway is that rationality, while perhaps leading to a desirable outcome, is unlikely to describe what people actually do.

Third, partisanship is now increasingly viewed as a social identity, not just a psychological group attachment. As we will detail in Chapter 6]], partisan identity has been aligning more and more with the other identities Americans hold: religious, social, and personal.[^10] Partisanship continues to exert a powerful sway on American voters and continues to influence how we assess the political world. In this, _The American Voter_ perspective may have merged with Campbell and colleagues’ classic, _The Voter Decides_.

Lastly, theories that connect emotions to cognition have arisen in recent years. In general, these theories argue that all social decisions are infused with feeling (also called “affect”), and those existing evaluations may influence how new information is processed. In many ways, this sounds like partisanship as a perceptual screen, but it is more generalizable. **Motivated reasoning**, as one of these theories is known, makes us tend to want to hold onto existing evaluations, even in the face of challenging information. We will talk about this in Chapter 6]] when we discuss identity. A connected idea of **hot cognition**, championed by Milton Lodge and Chuck Taber, argues that cognitively limited voters (which we all are) do not need to maintain vast stores of political knowledge. Instead, on encountering new information, voters evaluate it as good or bad, based on their own assessments, and store that evaluation in memory.[^11] They can then discard the specific knowledge that informed the evaluation. If true, then, when political scientists ask what people know about politics, citizens may be unable to answer in any depth, even if their current evaluation was informed by a good deal of information. Not everyone accepts this argument, with political psychologist John Zaller, in particular, arguing that evaluations are constructed from whatever is at the “top of our head” when we’re asked to make them.

The second dominant approach to emotions in the political psychology of voting is called **Affective Intelligence Theory** (AIT).[^12] Developed by George Marcus, Russell Neuman and Michael MacKuen, AIT argues for a view of emotions as discrete, that is, individualized, so that the effects of a positive emotion, such as enthusiasm, differ from the effects of specific negative emotions, such as anxiety or anger. Summarized simply, AIT posits separate cognitive and emotional systems in our brain, operating in parallel. However, the emotional system operates more quickly, and thus influences the cognitive system without our awareness. They find that when candidates generate enthusiasm, voters rely primarily on partisanship and do not look very deeply into their options. But when anxiety is generated, voters may stop and pay attention, and perhaps learn more about what is going on in politics. In any case, we will have more to say about this and the broader impact of emotions in Chapter 8]].

Across all of this, much of the core work of _The American Voter_ and _The Voter Decides_ still matters, even as more complex theories have been developed.[^13] One of these—the framework of voter information processing—gives us a better understanding of what voters actually do. Still, even with the newer perspectives on rationality, identity, and emotions, political psychologists find that partisanship still powerfully conditions American politics. Group identities still matter in how we perceive who we are in society and how we connect those perceptions to politics. And we are still debating rationality as a normative standard. The half-century-old work holds up, even as we turn to better understanding voting as a process. With this in mind, the next chapter introduces a group of voters with different modes of information processing, who will help us better understand the ways in which voters make decisions.

# 2Voter Decision-Making as a Process]]

If you’ve ever voted for a student council president or the president of the United States, you have almost certainly gone through some kind of _process_ to determine how to cast your vote. That is, you’ve paid some attention (even if only very little) to political information like campaign slogans, advertisements, speeches, reports, and so on. You’ve thought (even if just briefly) about the merits of one or more of the candidates, and perhaps you even went so far as to compare the candidates on some list of attributes (even if a very short list). One way or another, you decided how to vote before (or maybe as) you cast your vote. Then, you sat back and waited to learn the outcome.

The point is that for nearly every voter, something comes before the actual vote—some process of decision-making. There are many different models of decision-making, and each connects to some kind of strategy for learning about the options, evaluating them, and making a choice. Political psychologists are interested in the processes that go on in people’s heads, but which may well be visible in terms of the behaviors people exhibit when trying to make their voting decisions. This idea animates much of _How Voters Decide_, where the use of **dynamic process tracing experiments** allowed Lau and Redlawsk to make inferences about the strategies people use in voting decisions from the ways in which they search for and use information that informs their vote.

We usually think of experiments as something white-coated scientists do in labs with test tubes, chemicals, and the like. But the experimental method is an important part of the political psychologist’s toolkit. Experiments allow us to simplify reality and focus on specific factors that we hypothesize influence outcomes we are interested in studying. In its simplest form, experiments have two groups of participants: those who receive the **treatment** the researcher believes has some relationship to the outcome, and those who do not, called the **control** group. In the perfect experiment, everything else between the two groups is kept the same, so that if there is anything different between the groups at the end of the experiment, the difference is attributable to the treatment, and we can reasonably say the treatment _caused_ the outcome.

But, you may ask, what if there are major differences between those people in the treatment and control groups? For example, maybe the most politically interested participants are overrepresented in one group. Wouldn’t that make it hard to know if the effects were caused by the treatment, rather than by differences in the people? The answer is, yes, it would. We attempt to solve this problem by **random assignment** of participants to the treatment and control groups. Random assignment makes it probable (though not guaranteed) that the groups will have roughly equal numbers of participants on any criteria we consider. Random assignment should give us roughly the same number of men and women in each group, as well as the politically interested and less interested, and so on. Ultimately, this should wash out the effects of differences in individual participants, again leaving only the treatment as the difference between the groups. We should note that this does not always work, and the smart political psychologist will measure as many individual factors as possible to assure that the groups are equivalent.

The dynamic process tracing experiments are much more complicated than this, but the concept is the same. They employ a software system that can mimic an election environment in which the candidates, and information about them and different aspects of the campaign environment, can be manipulated in order to create treatments.[^1] The Dynamic Process Tracing Environment (DPTE) platform allows researchers to define any number of candidates competing in any type of election, varying features like the number of candidates running in primary elections, the extent to which candidates were very similar or quite different in ideology, the gender of the candidates, campaign resources available to the candidates, and the degree to which candidates were stereotypical members of their parties. Research participants are exposed to campaigns of whatever length the researcher determines. They learn about the candidates by clicking on “headlines” on the computer screen. The headlines then open to provide additional information, such as a candidate’s position on an issue, or perhaps a poll result, or even a campaign video. The researcher determines what information will be available about each candidate and for how long the participant gets to spend learning about the campaign.[^2]

Because we cannot actually see what people do in their heads with the information they examine, the DPTE system collects a wide range of metrics that describe the process each participant goes through in making a decision. These include measures such as how long the information was viewed (as a stand in for how carefully it is processed), the order in which information is chosen (suggesting the importance for the participant), and the extent to which participants attempt to learn the same information about every candidate (an indicator of comparing candidates on the same attributes). How one searches for information is an indicator of the decision strategies being employed to make a choice. As we will see, some strategies, such as rational decision-making, require a deep information search in which comparisons are made across all of the candidates available in the election. Other approaches, such as those designed to simplify the decision using intuitive decision-making, typically show a shallower search, with limited comparisons. The DPTE system allows the researcher to differentiate among types of information search, leading to solid inferences about the strategies voters employ.[^3]

## Goals

Presumably, for nearly everyone, the primary goal of voting is to identify and vote for the candidate who will best represent their interests, whatever those might be. When a voter successfully does this, we say she has “voted correctly.”[^4] A correct vote, then, is simply a vote for the “best” candidate given the choices available and the preferences of the voter. You might think that voting correctly is relatively easy in American politics. After all, many, though not all, of our elections are two-party affairs where voters choose either the Democrat or the Republican. Flip a coin and you could vote correctly 50 percent of the time. But it is not actually that simple. First, many American elections—and most elections outside of the U.S.—include more than two candidates or parties. For example, primary elections can see many candidates of the same party vying for the nomination. In 2016, there was at one point 18 Republican candidates running for the nomination, while five Democrats were seeking their party’s nod. At its peak, some 23 Democrats declared for the 2020 presidential race, attempting to be the nominee to face President Donald Trump. Getting it right in these contexts is considerably harder.

Second, there are many non-partisan elections in the United States, such as those for city or county office. For example, all municipal elections in California are nonpartisan. Candidates are on the ballot with no party identification, and the political parties do not make the nominations. The lack of partisan identification removes an important cue for voters, or **heuristic**, making it much harder to choose among the candidates. Often there are more than two candidates on the ballot in nonpartisan races, further complicating decision-making.

Finally, information flows are uneven, making it difficult to compare candidates across the attributes about which voters might care. Some candidates are simply covered more by the media than are others. In 2016, _The New York Times_ estimated that media coverage of Donald Trump would have cost his campaign upwards of $2 billion even before the primaries were over had it needed to buy equivalent advertising![5](ch07.xhtml#en18) At the other end of the spectrum, you have probably never heard of Mark Everson, former Internal Revenue Service Commissioner, who declared his candidacy for the GOP nomination in March 2015. Everson attended the Iowa State Fair, making a speech to a group of people numbering in the single digits, while the media took a lunch break. This is in stark contrast to the focus on other candidates at the same event, some of whom drew crowds numbering in the hundreds. The point is that voters cannot count on easily learning everything they want to know about every candidate potentially on the ballot, especially if they rely on media sources to inform them.

Political psychologists tell us that voters have various ways to cope with these challenges as they attempt to learn what they need to know. We will personify this with a set of voters who represent ideal-types of the different strategies voters can use. Each of our voters approaches decision-making differently. One key difference is where they fall on a continuum of making a “good choice” to making an “easy choice.” The field of Behavioral Decision Theory (which we will encounter again in Chapter 7]]) offers a core a proposition that, while people do want to make _good_ decisions, they also are motivated to make _easy_ decisions, in part because of a set of cognitive limitations that all human beings possess, and in part because many decisions just do not rise to the point of needing major effort. Voting is a decision, and as much as people might have a goal of identifying the candidate who best meets their interests, they may also just as strongly desire to get the decision made with a minimum of effort.

## Some Ideal-Type Voters

While not exactly real people, the following six voters show how different information search strategies work and what they mean for voter decision-making. Some of these voters were first introduced by Lau and Redlawsk in 2006, and we adopt them here to illustrate voter types as they did. We hope they will provide you with a hook to understand each of the recent approaches political psychologists have taken to voter decision-making, and will allow the theories to connect better to the actual political world. Throughout much of the rest of this book, we will come back to these voters a number of times and use them to illustrate key concepts. So, let’s get to know them.

## William R.: The Rational Voter

When we last met William R. in _How Voters Decide_, he had recently voted in the 2004 presidential election. An accountant then, and retired now, he lives in Rochester, NY, where he is a constant consumer of information. Back in 2004, it wasn’t all that hard to learn nearly everything there was to know about the candidates. It was pre-Facebook and Twitter, and most of William’s information came from dead tree newspapers and a nightly news show on PBS. William knew pretty much everything about the two main candidates in that election, incumbent Republican George W. Bush, and his challenger, Democrat John Kerry. He also knew what the third-party candidates were up to. He was (and is) a perfect example of a **rational voter**.

Rationality requires, among other things, that a voter be fully informed about his or her choices, and that he or she is able to make tradeoffs across all of the issues and attributes in an election and identify the candidate most likely to result in the best outcome according to his or her own interests, which are well-defined and known. In short, the goal of this kind of voter is to maximize their accuracy in voting. Sounds like something every voter should aspire to, right? Perhaps, but being a perfectly rational voter may bring its own unique challenges, including the question of how one can possibility spend the time necessary to learn everything there is to know about a presidential election. In 2016, William R. learned the hard way how difficult this actually is. He continued to want to be fully informed, but the explosion of information sources, the rise of “fake news,” and its conflation with legitimate news sources, made it all but impossible. Moreover, to inform himself about both parties’ primaries required William to consider 23 candidates at one point—18 Republicans and five Democrats. This seems well beyond anyone’s actual mental capacity, but since William is now retired, he set himself to the task, just as he always had. He continued to take pride in being a rational actor.

## Anne D.: The Constrained Rational Voter

Anne D. is a highly successful business consultant in San Diego who has been guided for years by the idea that “time is money.” She rarely votes in primaries, figuring that it will be easier for her to make sense of things once there are only two major candidates. In 2004, after having generally voted Republican in the past, she voted for Democrat John Kerry, turning away from the incumbent, Republican George W. Bush. Anne was a “pocketbook” voter that year, assessing the candidates “primarily in terms of how likely they are to have any tangible effects on her own pocketbook.” In other words, she made her decision based on her assessment of which candidate would be better for her own economic prospects. Like William, she wants to make the best decision she can. She does this by looking to the past, not the future, considering what had actually happened over the prior four years with the incumbent president. Thus, we also call her a **retrospective voter**, guided by past performance more than by any guesses she might make about the future. In 2004, she was unhappy with what had happened to her consulting business under President Bush’s term, so she decided to take a chance on Kerry.

Note that Anne makes a rational decision, in a sense, using information to assess the candidates before making her choice. And she aims to maximize her own self-interest, a hallmark of rational decision-making. But she cares little for the details of politics, does not find spending much time on it to be profitable, and so uses the most available information she has in order to efficiently make her choice.

Anne’s rationality is of a special kind. She does not examine all of the information for all of the candidates, in part because she believes it makes no sense to “waste my time” learning every little detail. The cost of all that learning is greater than she is willing to pay, given her busy life. So, she only gathers information about the two major party candidates, since no others seem to have any possibility of winning. She also primarily looks for easy access to information, such as watching television news shows, skimming an Internet news site, or checking out her Facebook and Twitter feeds. While she does try to learn a reasonable amount about both candidates, she stops her information search when she decides the cost of acquiring new information is greater than the benefit she will gain from learning it. She carefully weighs what she learns to give each candidate fair consideration. But, importantly, she is driven in part by what has already happened. That is, she considers the past performance of the incumbent candidate (or the party of the incumbent if term-limited) against her expectations of what would happen if the other party took control. Anne D. is rational, but with significant constraints that reflect both cognitive and practical limits—she has restrictions to how much time she will spend on politics—and she looks retrospectively at what has _already_ happened to make her estimates of what _will_ happen. As we’ll see, Anne continued to use this approach in 2016, which led her to seriously consider that it was time again for a change, after eight years of a Democratic president.

## Teresa C.: The Fast and Frugal Voter

Teresa C. regularly votes. In 2006, she was a soccer mom in suburban Atlanta, with four kids at home. Fast-forwarding 12 years, the last of her kids is out the door to college, and she’s now an empty-nester. In the 2004 election, her vote was driven by two issues important to her as a mom: school vouchers and prayer in schools. While she typically votes for Republicans, as she did in 2004, she is willing to vote for Democrats if they agree with her on what are now her key issues: the hazards of immigration and the need to ensure national security. Making the correct decision in 2016 was a challenge for Teresa. Hillary Clinton was long known as a hawkish Democrat, while Donald Trump appeared to be running on an isolationist platform. However, the differences between the two candidates on immigration, especially illegal immigration and the resettlement of refugees and their impact on national security, made that most important to her decision. While she was concerned about Trump’s comments about women and his ideas about eliminating environmental regulations, those issues were not all that important to her and did not factor into her choice.

Teresa C. is an issues voter, but limits her consideration to only one or two issues that are personally important to her, and are relatively easy to process. Ideally, according to liberal democratic theorists, all voters should think in issue terms: Which candidate will represent my individual views and values most accurately? In practice, however, like Teresa, most issues voters do not weigh the entire menu of issues. Rather, they stick to a few important ones. The logic goes, “as long as he delivers on _x,_ then I can give him a pass on _y_.” In many ways, Teresa is like Anne, our constrained rational voter. However, what divides these two voters is not just the number of issues that come into play, but the effort they put into searching for information about candidates. Even as Anne does not do the kind of demonic search William does, she does seek out a wide range of information that addresses most of the attributes of the major party candidates. Teresa limits her search with a goal of efficiency; as long as a candidate meets her preferences on the one or two most important attributes, she is happy to support that candidate. Hence, her decision-making is fast and frugal.

## Warren M.: The Identity Voter

Warren M. is a Republican through and through. He is a staunch partisan, and tends to vote for Republicans all the way down the ballot. In a sense, Warren _identifies_ as a Republican; it is not just a political preference, but something he would say he _is_. But back in 2004, he was a Democrat, and had always been one, for as long as he could remember.[^6] He grew up in a Democratic household in the city of Detroit, where his father, and his father before him, had been “yellow dog” Democrats: They’d vote for a yellow dog as long as it was a Democrat. Times were good in Detroit in those days, with the major auto manufacturers providing high-paying union jobs that drove the economic engine of the area. But things changed. The city changed. The economy fell apart, and the jobs left. The city of Detroit was left as a shell of itself. As for Warren, he lost his job when the factory in which had had worked his entire life shut down. After some time to consider what to do next, Warren moved from the city to Macomb County, MI, near Mt. Clemens, about 30 miles from Center City Detroit. He did so to seek new opportunities, and to be closer to members of his extended family who had moved to the suburbs years before.

Warren M. is actually well informed about politics, but unlike William R., Anne D., and Teresa C., he does not appear to use this knowledge as a base for internal deliberative processes as he considers his options. Instead, he searches for information that confirms his prior beliefs that Republican candidates are the ones to support. Doing so helps him maintain cognitive consistency by limiting exposure to information that might challenge what he already believes about the two parties. In this sense, his main goal is to _reaffirm his identity_. In 2016, Warren mostly sought out information supporting the claim that Trump was indeed a Republican. Essentially, in the face of Republican Party elites dismissing Trump as a disingenuous Republican throughout the primary campaign, Warren was looking for reasons to vote for Trump. And once Trump was the nominee, the decision process was easy: Vote for the Republican. In the end, his psychological attachment to the GOP and his identity as a Republican drives his decision-making process. All he really needs to know is the partisan identity of the candidate. As Trump was a Republican, and Clinton a Democrat, the choice was simple. Partisan identity—while critical to Warren’s vote—is only one of many identities that voters may assume, and which can then guide their political preferences.

## Herbert S.: The Intuitive Voter

Herbert S., an African-American, lived in Washington, D.C.’s northern suburbs in 2004, when he voted for John Kerry for president. A baby-boomer, Herbert crossed the line into retirement and social security a couple years ago and now lives with his wife in sunny Southern California, having moved to the west coast to “chill.” He loves the weather, and is happy to be away from the colder, damp winters of the northeast. When it comes to politics, he used to take his guide from the northeast’s four seasons: “It’s going to be hot in the summer, cold in the winter, and pretty nice in the fall and spring. And if something different happens, you’ll hear about it.” In California, his saying may no longer be as apropos, but his approach to politics is still to go with his gut, to assume things are pretty much as they always have been, unless he hears otherwise. Herbert does know something about politics. Democrats, he believes, are relatively liberal and for “the little guy” while Republicans support “the rich” and don’t really want government to do very much.

In 2004, his vote for Kerry did not take a great deal of consideration, and his choice was not informed by very much detailed information. In fact, Herbert puts as little effort as he can get away with into making a decision. His primary goal is to make things easy for himself. Given that he doesn’t consider himself rich, voting for Kerry (ironically, a wealthy New Englander) made sense since Kerry was a Democrat and Democrats help people like him while Republicans don’t. At least that’s how Herbert saw it. Not much has changed in his mind over the 12 years since 2004, but part of the reason for that is that Herbert does not seek out very much political information, even in the heat of a presidential campaign. This does not stop him from voting, however. He reliably shows up at the polls. But, as he tells people, “I vote with my gut, what feels right.”

This is an example of intuitive voting. Intuitive voters use strategies to simplify the decision environment, to limit the amount of information they need to find, and to make an easy decision rather than carefully making sure they make the best decision. They do this for many reasons: cognitive limits, little interest in politics, time pressures, perceived low stakes, and so on. In American politics this can work fairly well. After all, Democrats usually are more liberal than Republicans, and certainly even more so now than in 2004. Given only two options, even a coin flip will find the right candidate half the time. So, this strategy might make sense in a world where voting seems more a patriotic duty than a matter of carefully learning about the choices on the ballot. Some have even called this a rational strategy, with Samuel Popkin (1991) terming it “low information rationality” and suggesting that usually paying limited attention is good enough. We would not classify this as rational, however, given that a hallmark of rationality is maximizing the chances of making the best choice. Intuitive voters tend to accept that good enough may be good enough, just as Herbert does.

## Bethany A.: The Emotions Voter

When _How Voters Decide_ was published in 2006, there was little focus on the role emotions played in voter decision-making, not just in the book but across political psychology. So there was no mention of Bethany A., a voter for whom emotions play a critical role in deciding between candidates. In fact, the current view of emotions and voting suggests there is no separating emotions from thinking, even though we do so here for convenience.[^7] We presented all of the earlier voters (perhaps with the exception of Herbert S.) as primarily _thinking_ about politics as if the information search they do and the evaluations and choices they make are products of cognition only. But, unless emotional systems in the brain are somehow damaged, emotions will always be a part of the voter calculus, as we will detail in Chapter 8]].

For now, we will focus on Bethany and how emotions come into play for her. Bethany is a recent college graduate, now in her first job out of school. She is an actuary, a job which requires a high level of skill in quantitative reasoning, so she is accustomed to processing information in a cool, calculated way. But as Bethany found out in her first presidential election in 2016, politics seems to be a feeling person’s game. Not only do candidates work to play on voters’ feelings through rhetoric and campaign ads that engage us emotionally, but voters’ own existing feelings about the candidates and parties tend to influence how new information is processed. Bethany tried to carefully assess both Trump and Clinton in a rational manner (much like William R.) but found that some information seemed more “real” to her than others. She knew she liked Clinton better than Trump from the start, partly due to Clinton’s gender, but also because she grew up in a relatively liberal family and had heard good things about Clinton over the years. Thus, she started with first impressions that were asymmetric: more positive for Clinton and more negative for Trump. She quickly found that new positive information about Clinton was easy to process, as were negative things said about Trump. But the opposite was not true. She readily discounted bad things she heard about Clinton as fake news, while simply refused to believe there were good things about Trump to be learned.

Bethany’s **hot cognition**—existing evaluations attached to her thoughts about each candidate—biased her information acquisition and processing, and in the end made it hard for her to be even-handed in her assessment, a process political psychologists call **motivated reasoning**.[^8] It just felt right to support Clinton. But there was another emotional process going on as well. Bethany found herself anxious about Trump, worried that his election would lead to a much different country than the one she wanted. Clinton’s rhetoric about Trump thus raised Bethany’s level of anxiety, which led her to pay more attention to the election than she otherwise would have done. At the same time, Clinton’s campaign to be the first woman president also created a sense of enthusiasm that helped motivate Bethany to get to the polls and vote. As we noted in Chapter 1]], George Marcus’s **Affective Intelligence Theory** suggests these specific emotions (and anger) have differential effects on voters, both positive and negative. Regardless of which (or both) of these processes were activated by the campaign, there can be no doubt that emotions played a significant role for Bethany. And while, like all the others, Bethany wants to make a good decision, in her case, various emotional processes may make it harder (or at times possibly easier) to do so.

## A Process-Oriented Framework for Voter Decision-Making

Now that we have met the voters who will help guide us through these various approaches to voter decision-making, it is time to get a better understanding of the framework presented previously in Figure 1.1]].

The most important starting point is that this approach views voting as an ongoing process, not just a public activity at a single point in time. Much of the earlier research on voting focused on modeling factors that correlate with voting. Citizen’s social groups, their partisanship, and their positions on issues were all examined as possible causes of their vote decisions. For the most part, these traditional models worked very well; in general elections, partisanship alone predicted the vote with very high accuracy, and still does even in an era when people express dislike of both major U.S. parties. But for political psychologists, such predictions were not very satisfying, as they gave no real insight into how people came to feel as they did about the candidates and the conditions that influenced their voting decisions.

A process approach is very different. The underlying goal for the political psychologist is not just to predict but to _understand_ what voters do. To do that, we begin with the voter’s **background characteristics**, such as gender, age, partisanship, group preferences, issue preferences, and many more. One characteristic in particular is remarkably important: **political sophistication**. Sophistication is considered a critical variable that helps condition how voters interface with candidate and campaign characteristics. Those who know more about politics, are more aware of the details, and pay greater attention, should be able to process campaign information more effectively than those who do not. In turn, they should be able to make use of more complicated strategies for deciding which candidate best meets their interests.

The authors of classic studies like _The American Voter_ were rather negative about the ability of voters to act as model Democratic citizens. Ideal-type citizens are interested in politics, pay attention to the issues, and from time to time get involved themselves beyond simply showing up to vote. They also show **ideological constraint**, where their positions on issues of the day are consistent with their overall ideological preferences. Few such voters seemed to exist in _The American Voter_ studies, but we would call any who meet these standards **political sophisticates**. Political sophistication is generally assessed by considering voters’ interest in politics, their ability to correctly position themselves and the parties on issues (political knowledge), and their personal engagement in the political process.[^9] In the information processing framework, political sophistication is an individual difference factor that helps determine how well voters can navigate the political environment.

But it does more than that. Voters who know more can presumably handle more complicated task demands and are better at differentiating candidates in a complex environment. They may also be able to apply information search and processing strategies more effectively than voters who know little about politics and have limited interest. Political sophistication is connected to education, with better-educated citizens more likely to be politically sophisticated. Sophistication can also influence the degree to which voters can remember what they have learned about the candidates and issues over the course of a campaign. Finally, political sophistication should allow voters who know and care about politics to more accurately evaluate their choices and select the candidate who best meets their interests (Choice and Decision Quality, the key outcomes in the framework).

The other factor on the left side of the framework is labeled **Campaign Factors**. This accounts for all aspects of the campaign itself: the office on the ballot (President, Senate, Governor, etc.), the number of candidates seeking the office, and the number of different elections happening at the same time, for starters. In addition, this encompasses the nature of the candidates themselves: Are they liberal or conservative, are they new or experienced, do they have equal or unbalanced resources, are they men or women, and so on. The point here is that the voter faces a different task depending on campaign factors. In a presidential election, for example, it is almost impossible to avoid a torrent of candidate information. But in an election for your city’s mayor, it may actually be hard for voters to learn very much at all. Candidates may simply not have the resources to get out the word about their campaign. Political psychologists have looked at many different aspects of campaigns in seeking to understand how voters respond. In this framework, they are all subsumed into “campaign factors.”

Background characteristics of the voter and campaign factors come together to jointly define the **information environment** in which the voter operates, as shown by the arrows from each to **decision task** (what Lau and Redlawsk in 2006 called “the nature of the decision task”). The idea is simple: the combination of candidates and the campaigns constrains the voter. For example, there may be only two candidates running in a partisan general election campaign, where there is a great deal of media coverage, and where the candidates differ on many dimensions. Such a campaign environment should be relatively easy for voters to navigate, especially if they are most interested in electing the candidate who shares their partisan preference. Even a voter with relatively little political knowledge may learn who the Democrat is and who the Republican is, and vote accordingly. And, in fact, years of voting behavior research show that in environments like this—such as the 2016 general election—voters gravitate toward their party preference, no matter what else is happening. Despite all of the uncertainty ahead of election day in November 2016, data show that, in the end, about 92 percent of partisan voters voted for their own party’s presidential candidate.[^10] What could be an easier decision in American politics?

Alternatively, consider the 2016 Republican presidential primary season. While the Democrats started with five candidates, this was quickly reduced to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as the only two options. While the campaign between the two was intense and many Democrats found it difficult to decide between them, the task demands were nothing compared to the GOP race. Republican voters faced no fewer than 18 candidates during the campaign leading up to the Iowa Caucuses. At the February 1, 2016 Caucuses, 12 candidates received votes. So, imagine you were a Republican Iowa Caucus voter in late 2015 and wanted to decide which of these many candidates was your favorite. The crowded field made the choice difficult, of course, but, in addition, partisanship could not be used as a deciding factor, candidate ideologies overlapped considerably, and the media were unable to effectively cover many of them. You might have quickly found the task demands of the decision you had to make went off the charts. But, perhaps, you would have acted like many voters in complex environments by coming up with ways to simplify the decision, even though partisanship was not available to make it easy. We will explore the idea of an information environment further in Chapter 3]]. For now, we will turn to what voters do in response to the complexities they see in their task demands.

The work of applying decision-making strategies in complex environments is captured in the **Information Processing** term in the framework. This is where this approach goes well beyond traditional voting models. All of the earlier factors in the framework combine to define the nature of the decision task, and thus lead to particular information processing strategies that voters use to make sense of the decision in front of them. To be clear, these strategies, initially identified by marketing researchers and decision theorists, are not unique to voting. In fact, it is important to think of voting as very similar to other decisions that we have to make. For decisions of consequence, where we care about the outcome, we generally apply some sort of strategy to our information searches, which helps us in our efforts to make a good decision, while balancing that decision with all of the others we must make in our lives. Some strategies make this easier, while others require much more cognitive effort.

## Types of Information Processing Strategies

There are two basic types of strategies: **compensatory** and **non-compensatory**. Compensatory strategies are hard since voters must compensate for less desirable traits in a candidate by considering more desirable ones and making tradeoffs between them. If a candidate is particularly lousy on one issue, you might be willing to accept her anyway if she is good on something else you care about. Why is this hard? Compensatory strategies usually require searching for the same information across all candidates to facilitate comparisons. Voters must also do deeper searches within candidates in order to be sure that there are good positions to offset the bad ones. Thus, compensatory strategies require that voters collect a lot of information across all of the candidates in the election. In return, at least in theory, compensatory strategies should lead to better decisions, since voters should be well informed.

Non-compensatory strategies, on the other hand, require relatively little information search and are based on _avoiding_ tradeoffs. With a non-compensatory approach, a voter merely needs to determine if a candidate meets minimum expectations across the attributes about which he cares. There is no need to make tradeoffs. As long as a candidate is “good enough,” that’s good enough. Non-compensatory strategies are easier since there is less information search. Thus, they may be applied when the decision environment is particularly complex. But the result may be lower-quality decisions as voters make choices without much information. It should be obvious that both of these general approaches readily map onto the voters we profiled above based on how they search for information and where they lie on the good decision/easy decision continuum.

Beyond compensatory and non-compensatory decision strategies, there are several other important dimensions we must consider. These dimensions are relevant to any decision in which it is necessary to search information before making a choice. William R.’s unlimited information processing capacity notwithstanding, real people cannot learn everything there is to know about even moderately complex decisions. Thus, the ways in which we search for information have consequences for the decisions we make. In addition to thinking about making or avoiding tradeoffs, we should also consider how deep an information search might be, that is, how much information will actually be acquired before a decision is made. As hinted at above, **depth of search** is related to whether a search is compensatory or not, but it also matters on its own. You can make tradeoffs using only a little bit of information. Likewise, you can avoid tradeoffs while still looking at many different attributes of the candidates. In general, though, deeper searches should be better informed, and thus be higher quality. Shallower searches by definition mean learning less about the candidates. That is, a shallow searcher will be less informed. Acquiring limited information about your choices could easily lead to lower-quality decisions.

Another factor to consider is whether you try to learn the same information about every alternative available to you before you make a decision. This is **comparability**, or the extent to which you examine the same attributes about every option available to you. In voting terms, that means comparing candidates on the issues, their experience, their personalities, and whatever else it is you want to know. Access to the Internet greatly improves the chances of higher comparability, since it is relatively easy to look up information about all of the candidates, and to focus on the same information about each one. As we were writing this, at least one website, _www.isidewith.com_]], provided viewers with the opportunity to take a lengthy issues quiz and then see which 2018 candidates and parties matched with them as well as the degree to which they did. Undoubtedly, there will be many such sites for 2020.

But even with these tools, voters may not want to spend a lot of time directly comparing candidates on a wide range of attributes. As we shall see, the extent of comparability, whether high or low, is another defining feature that helps us understand the decision strategies voters are employing. Like depth of search, we would presume that higher comparability is better; that is, the best decision-making approach ensures that you have the same information about all of your options. Low comparability might mean that while you know candidate A’s position on one issue, you do not know candidate B’s position on that same issue.

It should be readily apparent why that might make for lower-quality decisions. And yet, as we learn more about our voters, we will find out things are not always what they seem to be. Achieving high depth and high comparability is hard, requiring a great deal of time and effort. For many voters in many elections, taking that time and making that effort may not pay off as well as we might think, since it is possible to suffer from **information overload**, a condition where the amount of information we try to acquire may overwhelm our cognitive capabilities.

A final dimension to consider is the order in which information is learned. That is, the **sequence** of the search. Conceptually, this is very straightforward. One can search for information by focusing first on the alternatives themselves or on the attributes of those alternatives. Which approach is taken can have implications for what kind of information is learned and how it is processed. It should be clear that for a decision maker who is committed to learning everything about every option (like William R.), the sequence of learning information is of less importance since he will eventually know everything about everyone.[^11] But what if you do not learn everything? What if you decide to learn about one candidate first, and you find that candidate acceptable? You might never bother to learn anything about the alternatives. While this is connected to comparability, the key point, here, is that if both candidates are acceptable, then the sequence of your search—which one you start with—will determine who you support. In a sense, you could be at the mercy of some random process that introduces you first to candidate A, and you never learn about candidate B. What you did not know is that while candidate A was acceptable, candidate B was even better.

_Candidate-based_ search suggests identifying one candidate, then searching for whatever information is desired for that candidate and completing the search before moving to the next candidate. _Attribute-based_ search suggests identifying an attribute (like the candidates’ positions on gun control) and searching for that attribute across all candidates before moving on to the next attribute. Both of these approaches are “ordered” or “structured” search processes. Alternatively, you might jump around, learning one attribute about one candidate then jumping to a different attribute about a different candidate. Such “haphazard” search is likely to be inefficient and to lead to lower-quality decisions since it makes it hard to do any kind of practical evaluation of a single candidate or comparison across multiple candidates.

## Decision-Making Models

This process-oriented framework provides a way to think about how voters encounter and process information about candidates and the factors that influence their decision-making. However, the framework does not tell us how voters actually make their decisions or how the information they encounter during an election is processed in order to do so. For that, we have to introduce a set of information processing models that are the logical outcomes of the decision strategy factors we discussed in the previous section. If we consider comparability, compensation, depth of search, and sequence of search, we can develop a set of information processing models that take each into account, which we show in Table 2.1]], adapted from Lau and Redlawsk (2006), Figure 2.2.

Each of these models and its associated voter is described in detail in upcoming chapters. But one of our voters—Bethany A., our “Emotions Voter”—does not fit neatly into this pattern. Bethany can use any of these strategies. And for two of the models, there are subtypes, and our voters may be in either subtype depending on circumstances. So, while we’ve tried to make things neat and tidy to make them easier to connect, mapping research types onto the real world is rarely that simple.

Model 1 voters are rational voters. Like William R. and, to a lesser extent, Anne D., these voters attempt to learn a great deal of information about each of the candidates for whom they have the opportunity to vote. They want to be fully informed and are motivated to do the best possible job. This leads them to decision-making where they make tradeoffs across different attributes of each candidate; a low “score” on one attribute can be overcome by a “high” score on another. Both William and Anne try to maximize the outcome they will get by making the best possible choice. Thus, they have to carry out a deep search (William much more so than Anne, as we will see in Chapters 4]] and [^5]) and must seek high comparability—learning the same things about every candidate in order to directly compare each candidate on every attribute. For Model 1 voters, the sequence of search—whether focused first on the candidate or on attributes—should not really matter. The same information and same set of candidates will be learned no matter which order is used.

Model 2 voters are not like this at all. Instead, they are focused on identity, generally seeking to affirm their own sense of who they are (for example, a Republican or a Democrat) and aiming to confirm that their already preferred candidate fits with that sense of self. The idea of an identity voter develops from _The American Voter_’s perspective that partisan identity—a sense of _belonging_ to a political party—is a psychological attachment that colors the way many citizens view political stimuli, particularly in a partisan general election.[^12] The Model 2 voter already knows he will likely vote for his party, as long as the candidates fit his expectations. So, Warren M. aims his information search at learning enough to ensure that his party’s candidate is what he expects. Rather than having a goal of maximizing the expected outcome by comparing candidates, Warren’s goal is to confirm expectations with somewhat limited effort. Information search like this can be relatively deep in that Warren may learn a lot about his party’s candidate, although he does not have to. At one level, Warren may allow tradeoffs so that if the candidate is not quite right on one issue, being really right on another can override that. But he may also be turned off by his own party candidate if that candidate is really wrong on something he cares about, in which case, other attributes cannot compensate. In any event, search will be candidate-focused, with little attention paid to the other party’s candidate, and thus of unequal comparability. In this book, we expand Model 2 well beyond partisanship; the research on the role of identity, coupled with the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, suggests that many different identities can drive our political decision-making and, thus, the information search underlying it. More on this in Chapter 6]].

Teresa C. is a Model 3 voter—“Fast and Frugal.” In Teresa’s case, her shortcut is that she only cares about a small set of key issues, and so she only needs to learn about the candidates’ position on those, and nothing more. Her information search is explicitly comparative; she does not start out with a default preference like Warren M. But it is pretty shallow and does not engage in much detail. But what she does learn, she learns about all of the candidates in the election (comparability is equal across candidates) and she allows for tradeoffs across candidate attributes, making the search compensatory. But it doesn’t matter what sequence she uses; like Model 1 voters, she will learn the same information whether she starts by focusing on candidates or attributes. And like Model 1, she is trying to get the best possible outcome—to do a good job—but unlike them, she does not want to expend a lot of effort to do so. We’ll talk more about this in Chapter 5]].

With Model 4, we have something very different. While Models 1 and 3 both represent versions of rational (or at least comparative) decision-making, and Model 2 is really tied to one’s identity, Model 4 represents a completely different breed of decision maker. Herbert S. isn’t interested in doing the very best job he can do. For Herbert, good enough is good enough. That being the case, he is motivated to make an easy decision, limit his information search, and simply ensure that he doesn’t go too far in the wrong direction. Herbert practices a form of intuitive decision-making, in some sense going with his “gut” rather than carefully comparing his options. Samuel Popkin, in his 1991 book, _The Reasoning Voter_, called a similar approach “Low information rationality,” suggesting that voters can do a pretty good job by using information readily available to them, rather than attempting to be rational (Model 1) actors. Herbert Simon championed the idea of “bounded rationality,” arguing that survival doesn’t require maximizing outcomes by knowing all future paths of a decision. Instead, simply looking to the next stage is enough, and therefore, limited information search can pay off just fine. This is a complicated topic and we will address it in much more detail in Chapter 7]]. For now, we just want to note that the Intuitive (Model 4) voter generally does not make tradeoffs, learns only enough to avoid problems, and may do an unequal search that stops when a “good enough” option is identified. Such voters use heuristics, or shortcuts, and work to simplify the decision environment before making a choice.

Our “emotions” voter, Bethany A., does not fit neatly into these boxes. Emotions play a significant role in voter decision-making, but that role is outside of the models we have described. Every one of our other voters may, in the real world, find that emotional responses to the campaign and candidates interact with their efforts to think about their options. The models described here are generally cognitive, meaning that they are about how we think about politics. However, it is also the case that “politics is about feeling.”[^13] An emotions voter can engage in a search that is deep or shallow, equal or unequal. Research in emotions in politics has exploded over the past two decades, and we now have a sense of a wide range of ways in which our emotions interact with our thinking to condition our perceptions. We’ll explore these perspectives in Chapter 8]].

## Conclusion

Some approaches to decision-making should be _better_ than others. Rational choice adherents argue that learning all of the (relevant) information about choices and calculating their likely payoffs leads to maximizing the possibility of reaching the best choice. Others argue that voters can be rational without knowing a lot of detailed information. Still others reject the notion that the best choice has to be made in the first place. What all of these arguments have in common is that they assume we can determine what the best choice actually is. If I am offered two different sums of money, with no strings attached, the best choice will be to take the one that is larger. But what is the best choice for a voter and how do we know if she has voted “correctly?” We argue that the best choice for any given voter is the one she would make if she indeed had full information, that is, knew everything there was to know. In the real world, no voter has full information, but some have more than others. They found that on average, about 75 percent of Americans vote correctly in presidential elections.[^14] Sounds good, right? Except, remember that in our (largely) two-party system, one could vote correctly 50 percent of the time by flipping a coin.

The different approaches to information search should result in different likelihoods of voting correctly. If Model 1 is really the best approach, those attempting to use something like it (more like Anne D. than William R.) should do better than those using the other approaches. But that’s not what we have found. Instead, Model 4 voters—using intuition and a wide array of shortcuts—actually do better than Model 1 voters, who do the worst. This is likely due to information overload: There is just too much to process given our cognitive limits. Intuitive voters, attempting to find the “good enough” candidate, seem to vote correctly more often.

Before we continue our discussion of how people make voting decisions and what leads to correct voting, we first need to get a better understanding of the information environment in which voters operate. There is a significant challenge to researchers trying to develop information processing models of voting, which is that the information environment is different for every campaign. As a result, one could argue that each election is unique, and that whatever we learn from studying any one campaign may be limited in its application to other campaigns. If that were true, then perhaps we could be wasting our time. Happily, we are not, since while each campaign is unique, across multiple campaigns we can learn quite a lot about how citizens respond to candidates and make their voting decisions. To do so, we need to look for regularities in campaign information environments and then try to learn how voters respond to them regardless of the specifics of a given election campaign. We turn to the information environment in the next chapter.

Seen as an _identity_, partisanship is something more than a simple calculation of which party is “best” on a basket of issue preferences. The authors of _The American Voter_ called it a psychological attachment; if so, it would be quite difficult to change, but not impossible. In our example, Warren changed his partisan preference, and did so for reasons we will detail in Chapter 6]]. This does not mean he was not psychologically attached to being a Democrat, it just means that that attachment was eventually weakened and ultimately broken.

Such complaints about voters have assumed that more political knowledge/sophistication is always better.

[^11]: Having said this, it is possible that learning one piece of information can have effects on how the next piece of information is perceived. You might learn that candidate A supports automatically making all undocumented residents citizens of the United States. Having learned that, and perhaps finding it extreme, learning that candidate B supports a pathway to citizenship may make candidate B’s position seem more reasonable than it would have been if you hadn’t first learned about candidate A’s extreme position. Still, for our purposes, we will assume that William R., the only one of our voters who tries to learn everything about everyone, can also objectively assess each piece of information without bias. This is not at all realistic, but neither is William’s apparent cognitive capacity, as we will see.

[^12]: Partisanship is generally useless as a decision rule during a party primary. Since every candidate running is in the same party, a voter like Warren cannot differentiate candidates in this way. He can, however, still search to ensure the candidates are good representatives of the party as he makes his decision.

# 3The Voter’s Information Environment]]

All election campaigns are about information. Candidates try to get information to voters either directly or indirectly while voters try to make sense of the information available to them. Candidates can control some of the information that goes out through their use of various media strategies, including social media posts, direct mail, television ads, campaign rallies, and so on. But there is much they cannot control, including how the news media interprets and presents them, and how opponents respond and frame each other. For voters, information is critical. In the extreme, if no candidate presented any information about herself or her opponent, and no media existed, voters would know nothing at all. This may sound unlikely, but consider many local elections. There is often no local media coverage of these elections, very little money spent by candidates or outside groups, and thus very limited information on which voters can act. While this is not the place to discuss campaign finance, it is quite clear that money in politics buys the release of information—both good and bad—and limiting it can significantly limit the information available to voters.

In this chapter we discuss what is meant by task demands in the information environment (Decision Task in Figure 1.1]]) and what experimental studies have taught us about them. We will then complete our summary of the information processing framework by touching on the role of memory in decision-making and examining the more critical question of how we know if voters make good decisions. We conclude by considering the nature of the information environment in the 2016 presidential election and whether it represented something unprecedented in American elections, which would require rethinking the information processing perspective we are using in this book. Spoiler alert: It didn’t.

## The Information Environment as Task Demands

Why use the phrase “information environment”? We choose this phrase because it better conveys the complexity of campaign environments, while also minimizing technical language. The phrase “task demands” has been used in decision research to suggest how factors in the environment come together to make a particular decision easier or harder to make. For example, if you have three options from which to choose, you are faced with greater task demands than if you only have two, because you must consider an additional alternative as you make your decision, increasing its difficulty. Likewise, if there is a high degree of similarity between the alternatives, it is much more demanding to differentiate between them and pick the right one, than when the options are very different from one another, and you can readily see which is best for you. Of course, at the same time, if the alternatives are very similar, there may be less risk in making the (rationally defined) wrong choice. So, the phrase “task demands” incorporates the idea that some decision tasks are harder than others and that the degree of difficulty has implications for the strategies people use to make those decisions.

What makes voting tasks more or less difficult are the variations in the information environment created by different kinds of campaigns and different elections. Presidential elections in which there is at least one serious third-party candidate are often harder for voters to decide than when the only choice is between a Republican and a Democrat. Similarly, partisan elections in which voters know who is in which party are potentially much easier than non-partisan elections in which candidates do not run under a party label. The former allows voters to rely on their partisanship as a guide. But in the latter, partisanship doesn’t work, and so voters have to look more deeply. Likewise, contested primary elections will generally be harder for voters than general elections, all else equal, for exactly the same reason. When your partisan preference cannot guide you, then you must do more work to determine whom to support.

Another way in which the task demands in elections vary is how differentiated candidates are in their policy preferences, which makes the decision much harder than if candidates establish clear conflicting positions. In cases where a Republican takes on Democratic positions, or a Democrat supports traditionally Republican solutions, voters would also have more trouble, due to the violation of expectations about what Republicans or Democrats should believe. Finally, the resources candidates bring to an election can also make the voters’ decisions easier or harder. When one candidate has much more money than another, that candidate will be able to create an imbalance in the information environment, making it easier for voters to learn about him, but harder to learn about the opponent. As a result, task demands increase.

Voters do not have direct control over the nature of the task demands of a particular election, given that these demands are part of a broader information environment that is pushed on voters by candidates and the media. However, voters do have ways of responding to the information environment. The different information processing models we discussed in Chapter 2]] can be thought of as potential responses. Less complex environments make it easier to apply more difficult strategies like Model 1 or Model 3 rationality, because with fewer alternatives, it becomes easier to learn what you need to know about each one. When there are many candidates or candidates are hard to differentiate, voters may be more likely to use intuitive strategies (like Model 4) or potentially focus on a confirmatory (Model 2) identity-focused approach. But it is not necessarily as clear-cut as this. For example, in one of the easiest task demand environments in U.S. elections, where there is one Democrat and one Republican, and where they are both readily distinguishable and stick to their partisan expectations, voters might actually use a simple identity-based process—look for the candidate who is in my party and vote for her. Nonetheless, there is some connection between task demands and the information processing strategies voters try to use to make their decisions.

## Experimenting with Task Demands

Any model proposed to explain how voters make decisions has to be tested. The information processing model was tested through a series of experiments by Lau & Redlawsk using the DPTE system. In order to test what happens when task demands are higher or lower, they manipulated the task demands faced by the voters in their studies. One of the hallmarks of any experiment is that some participants get one version of a treatment, while others get a different version, or no treatment at all. What makes a well-designed experiment powerful is the ability to compare groups of participants to each other, where the only thing that has changed is the nature of the treatment they received. For their experiments, Lau and Redlawsk manipulated the task demands faced by their participants in several ways by randomly varying the number of candidates, the ideological distance between the candidates, the resources made available for the campaign, and whether the candidate the participant voted for in the primary actually won or lost the primary. Participants also had to learn about and vote in both the primary and general elections, which are very different electoral environments.

It should be pretty obvious that making a choice between two candidates is easier than between four, so the task demands of the two-candidate primary were certainly less than the four-candidate primary, all else equal. But, on the other hand, making a decision between a set of candidates in your own party is certainly going to be harder in most cases than choosing between a candidate from your party and a candidate from the other party. Thus, the primary elections created greater task demands than the general elections that followed them, all else equal. The general elections were always two-candidate elections, with one Democrat and one Republican. It should be clear that these treatments—the number of candidates in the primary, and the general election versus the primary—very closely mimic what happens in real elections, and thus, provide the opportunity to see whether different campaign environments influence the ability of voters to learn about candidates and pick the one who best represents them.

In addition to manipulating the number of candidates, the studies made certain elections more or less difficult for voters because of who the candidates were. While participants knew nothing about any of the candidates at the beginning, by clicking on the headlines that appeared on the screen, they could learn quite a lot about each candidate. In most experiments, the candidates had roughly the same resources to make information available, so it was equally easy (or hard) to learn about each candidate. But in some studies, the resources were manipulated, so that one candidate was able to present much more information than anyone else. This was done by having the system simply present more items that could be learned for the better-resourced candidate and fewer for the other one(s). When a candidate has fewer resources, voters usually have a harder time learning the details, and thus should find it more difficult to compare all of the candidates evenly.

Manipulation of the ideological differences between the candidates also changed the task demands faced by the study participants. For some, the candidates in the general election were clearly ideologically distinct—a very conservative Republican versus a very liberal Democrat. For others, the candidates were both moderate and took positions right in the middle of the ideological spectrum, sometimes even taking positions that would be more typical for the candidate on the other side. This was done by having the DPTE system vary the positions assigned to the candidates, rather than actually changing any of the language in the positions. So, whether a position on gun control was assigned to the Republican candidate or the Democratic candidate, the position itself did not change. This ensured that all participants who chose to learn about gun policy would read the same positions but would be told that different candidates took those positions. This helped to ensure experimental control.

Another task demand manipulation was whether the voter’s preferred primary candidate actually won the primary and therefore was in the general election, or lost the primary and was out. If the former case, the participant would already know a great deal about that candidate (much more than the other party’s general election contender) and would presumably not need to learn much more, making the decision task potentially easy. But, if the favorite primary candidate lost, the voter would be facing a general election with a candidate of her own party whom she had already rejected and may not have learned as much about.

Other manipulations of the information environment tested other interesting political psychology questions. Most of the studies randomly manipulated the gender of the candidates in the primary election, so that sometimes there would be women presidential candidates. When these studies were initially carried out in the 1990s, the idea of a woman candidate for a major party was still in the future, and so having women as candidates was a novelty for voters. This treatment was easily implemented since the only thing that changed was the candidate picture—even the names had been chosen to be gender neutral. Thus, gender could be studied without any confusion relating to different candidate positions, personality, or experience.[^1] Another manipulation of the environment voters faced was to vary the physical appeal of the candidates. In one study, the general election candidate who was ideologically similar to the participant was randomly made either attractive or unattractive. This manipulation was done by modifying the picture used for the candidate as well as giving the negative candidate unattractive personality traits; nothing else was changed. The question was whether voters would support an unattractive ideologically similar candidate (which they rationally should) over an attractive ideologically opposed candidate. In the primary campaign, a large share (46.9 percent) of study participants preferred the likable candidate over the one who was closer ideologically.[^2] In various other studies there were additional manipulations, but we will maintain our focus here on the task demands manipulations.

## Vote Choice and Quality

The purpose of the information processing framework is to help us understand how voters use the information they encounter during a campaign to make a voting decision. Everything we have talked about so far leads to the final step on the right side of the framework in Figure 1.1]].—Vote Choice & Quality. These are two different things that are expanded upon in detail in the original research. Here we focus primarily on the issue of **decision quality** since that is a key contribution to the political psychology perspective on voting. But first, we will make a few more points about the distinction between evaluation and choice that we introduced a couple pages back.

Some people have a great deal of information, while some have very little, perhaps as little as somehow vaguely remembering a politician’s name. Most of us, however, if we do know a politician’s name, can come up with some sense of how we feel about him or her. This is much easier, of course, if we have a partisan preference and we know what party the politician is in. In fact, as the authors of _The American Voter_ recognized many years ago, our partisan preferences strongly influence our feelings about those within and outside our own party. It may well be that partisan preference can substitute for having actual information. When asked about candidate John Smith, for example, we might have only a very moderate response. But when asked about Republican Jane Doe, our response may be much stronger, depending on how we already feel about Republicans and Democrats. In this sense, evaluation is not simply a straightforward assessment of the information we encounter about a political figure, but, instead, a mix of existing information and existing evaluations which then determine to a high degree how we respond to the new information.

Most voter decision-making research has, at least implicitly, assumed that when voters learn about candidates in an election, they make their evaluations in a relatively unbiased manner, except to the extent that partisanship plays a role. Voters presumably have incentives to evenhandedly evaluate candidates since there could be consequences for making the wrong decision. Certainly, rational approaches (Model 1 and Model 3) make this assumption. But research has shown this is simply not true. The strategies voters follow determine the information that they encounter, and that information feeds into their evaluations of the candidates.

Strategies that require a comparative search necessitates that voters examine each candidate in the election on the same set of attributes, and thus evaluate each candidate on the same metric. Presumably, evaluations that arise from such rational strategies would be more accurate assessments, in that the voter would learn everything he or she needs to know. But rational strategies can be hard to execute. The voter must keep track of a lot of information on his or her own, although the rise of the Internet and easily searchable digital archives might make this easier. Such strategies also require tradeoffs, comparing a candidate who is “good” on one dimension but bad on another to a candidate who is bad on the first but good on the second. In this case, the voter also needs to decide which dimension matters more before being able to make the necessary evaluation.

Voters who use intuitive strategies (Model 4) potentially risk missing information by failing to compare candidates and not making tradeoffs. There is a real risk that a voter may simply never consider a candidate who could be exactly the right choice simply because intuitive strategies can result in ignoring some candidates to make the decision easier. However, the actual process of learning about candidates is much easier because it creates fewer cognitive demands. As for Model 2 voters, their evaluation is tied up in their own identity, so how they respond to candidates in an election is highly connected to their own sense of who they are and whether a given candidate fits that image. The larger point is that the evaluations voters make of candidates and the choice they ultimately make can be highly contingent upon the decision strategy a voter adopts for a particular election. The decision strategy is, at least in part, chosen due to the information environment of the campaign.

This leads to the usual question for most voting behavior researchers: Can we predict which candidate a voter will choose, given an understanding of the voter’s preferences and the campaign environment? Researchers who do not make use of an information processing framework usually focus on this relatively narrow question. But the framework goes further, and asks if we can determine if voters make the _right_ choice; that is, do they “vote correctly?” The basic idea depends on the following statement being true: Voters should choose the one candidate who best represents their interests. If they do so, then they are **voting correctly**. If not, they are not. Of course, there is more nuance to it than that.[^3] And even in an American presidential election, it is not always easy to vote correctly. As a reminder, from 1980 to 1996, Lau and Redlawsk estimated that, on average, about 75 percent of voters chose the candidate who best represented their interests. But, as we noted earlier, that rose to about 90 percent in 2016 as the American electorate became more polarized and more closely aligned with the parties.

But what does it mean to _best represent_ someone’s interests? We do not pretend to know what voters’ interests are and so did not set some kind of normative standard as to what they might be. If a voter wants a candidate who will go seeking the mythical lost sunken city of Atlantis, then they will have voted correctly if they vote for the candidate who advocates doing so. In effect, the voter is presumed to know his or her own interests, and those interests then become known to the researcher by the information he or she searches for during the campaign. If a voter does not try to learn something, we can assume she is not interested in that aspect of the campaign or the candidates, and it should not be included when determining if someone cast a correct vote.

More important than what voting correctly means in practice is that the concept itself can be used to assess the question of whether there are strategies that _increase the chances_ of a voter making the right decision. The rational choice approach assumes that voters should learn as much as possible (perhaps subject to the cost of learning that information) in order to be well informed. In general, political scientists believe the more voters know, the better. But to know more, a voter must make a significant effort to learn about candidates. The only reason to do that would be to make a better decision. But until the idea of voting correctly, there was no usable standard for what a better decision would be. A correct vote defines that standard.

Using correct voting as the standard of quality for the voting decision in their framework illuminates some surprising things. The standard assumption is that accuracy and effort are in conflict with one another. To do a good job, one must work hard. But working hard means the decision process is not easy. In _How Voters Decide_, Lau and Redlawsk find that participants in their studies who tried to be as rational as possible—that is, tried to be Model 1 voters—actually voted correctly less often than voters who use simpler intuitive strategies (Model 4) where they took steps to simplify the decision environment and did not try to learn everything about everything in the election.

## The 2016 Task Demands and Information Environment: Unique or More of the Same?

The 2016 U.S. presidential election and its information environment was seemingly unique. Part of what is driving this perception is the stunning outcome. In the weeks leading up to the election, probability models put together by _HuffPost_ and 538.com forecasted that Clinton would win the election, in part because she had established a so-called blue firewall in the states crucial to victory in the Electoral College.[^4] But these notions overplayed the lead that Clinton had in some states and underplayed it in others. Part of the reason that the outcome of the election was surprising to many was that both candidates were perceived unfavorably by much of the electorate heading into November.[^5] We will briefly visit a number of facets of the information environment that may have distinctly complicated the task in front of voters as they made their decision, such as the phenomenon of fake news, the ubiquity of social media networking sites as the new gatekeepers of political information, and the ways in which the country’s political punditry constructed the campaign in ways that constrained or enabled the candidates to shape the environment. The information bubbles that people either unconsciously or self-selected into meant that many voters were only able to really hear one side of the story about either candidate. The bubbles mitigated the impact of inputs like the _Access Hollywood_ tape (more on that, later), for example, while amplifying the brouhaha over various Clinton email scandals. Voters were asked to navigate an extremely complex information environment rife with apparent Russian meddling, xenophobia, sexism, and scandal—and that’s before getting around to considering the complicated issues and policy questions of the day.

But how different from other modern presidential elections was this environment really? Were the good old days really simpler times in the context of political information? While the environment may seem more complex, perhaps voters still basically approach elections the same way they always have—with shortcuts and heuristics, partisanship, and other identities in tow. Voters must respond to the information environment in which any given election operates, and it is in this respect that 2016 was no exception. They still had to make sense of the environment and make decisions. While this particular election certainly had its unique aspects (as does every campaign), those features do not limit our ability to think in general terms about the political psychology of voting in 2016. Even in the context of a Trump campaign violating long-standing norms about how presidential politics ought to be conducted,[^6] voters still had to process the information they encountered. Since we focus on voters and not on campaigns, we remain confident that voter information processing—the political psychology of voting—was not significantly different from any other election. Having said that, however, it makes sense to be sure we have a clear idea of what did go on in the 2016 election, and so we ask: What were the task demands of the 2016 election?

## Indicators of Task Demands in 2016

To what degree was the 2016 general election easier or harder for voters? Unlike the elections of 1980, 1992, and 2000, the minor party candidates in 2016 were not expected to make much of a splash, so presumably voters could have focused solely on the two candidates who had a chance of winning, Trump and Clinton. Certainly, for the most part, the media focused on these candidates, giving little attention to Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. For the vast majority of voters, this was a two-candidate partisan election—one of the least demanding environments. However, for some voters, both Stein and Johnson garnered attention. Some left-wing Democrats who had supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary in particular had the more demanding decision of whether to support their party’s nominee or defect to the Green Party candidate. For some very conservative or libertarian-oriented voters, the decision may have been between Trump and Johnson. Ultimately, about 6 percent of all voters chose someone other than Clinton or Trump. Some commentators suggested that the votes that went to Stein in particular made the difference between winning and losing key states for Clinton, thus tipping the Electoral College to Trump, despite her almost 2.9 million vote lead nationwide. But, alternatively, Johnson received more than three times as many votes as Stein, many of which would presumably have gone to the GOP if there were no Libertarian running. Perhaps Trump’s margin would have been larger were that the case. Whether either of these is true or not—and it is a complicated question—for most voters, task demands in terms of the number of candidates were low, as they usually are in presidential elections.

A second indicator is whether the candidates in the race are distinctive in their ideologies and policy preferences or are more similar than not. It may seem quaint as we write this, but at one time, many people saw “not a dime’s worth of difference” between Republicans and Democrats.[^7] We certainly could not have said this about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in 2016. No one can doubt that voters had the opportunity to see these two candidates as very different from each other on many dimensions. It would be hard to argue that any voters would find themselves confused about the differences between the two, suggesting this indicator points to a relatively easy information environment. On the other hand, Trump was certainly not a stereotypical Republican presidential candidate. In his policy positions, he often embraced ideas dear to Democrats’ hearts, such as massive increases in federal spending on infrastructure. In 2004, he was even quoted as saying “I probably identify more as a Democrat.”[^8] And while many of his stated positions were at odds with the Democrats, there may have been enough confusion about his underlying policy preferences to make choosing between him and Clinton more difficult, especially for middle-of-the-road voters. The fact that Trump was not a typical Republican, then, may have increased the task demands of the 2016 election, at least for some voters.

One group of voters who would have had increased task demands were those who had voted for some candidate who did not end up being the nominee of their party. For Democrats, supporters of Bernie Sanders during the primaries may well have found it difficult to pivot to Hillary Clinton, even if they were strong Democrats.[^9] Likewise, Donald Trump won the Republican primaries with only a plurality of the votes across all contested primaries, so a majority of Republicans had preferred someone else when they had options.[^10] It is certainly a harder task to decide on your general election vote choice when your candidate fails to get past the primaries. For many voters in 2016, this would have been the case. At the same time, this is not much different than any other year when there are contested primaries. And as we noted earlier, about 90 percent of self-identified Democrats and Republicans ultimately voted for their party’s nominee in 2016.

What else made the choice more difficult than we might expect in 2016? One especially unique factor was the disparity between campaign spending and media coverage. Politicians always want to get their message directly to potential voters, unfiltered, and so they try to bypass mass media organizations as the gatekeepers of political information. In some elections, one candidate greatly outspends the others, and thus has greater ability to get information across to voters through campaign advertising. In the modern era of campaigns between 1976 and the early 2000s, campaign finance laws kept the two major parties on relatively equal financial footing since candidates used the public funding option allowing them to draw on taxpayer money in return for limiting their spending. While that law remains in place, in more recent elections, and especially 2016, candidates have rejected public financing and thus have not faced any spending limits. Decisions by the Supreme Court have also gutted many campaign finance restrictions, allowing not just candidates but outside groups to spend whatever they can raise.

In 2016, however, a new phenomenon occurred, where one candidate, Trump, received massively more media coverage than any other, creating a more than usually lopsided information environment.[^11] This was true in both the primary and general election, and Trump did not have to spend as much money to get his messages to the voters. As we discuss in more detail below, this is one aspect of the information environment in 2016 that may have been substantially different from other years, and may have led voters to find it relatively harder to get information about Clinton than Trump, leading to greater task demands for those who wished to investigate both candidates thoroughly. Nonetheless, it would seem that the task demands of 2016 for voters might not have been all that different from most elections. But this is only part of the story. What about the information environment, which itself is influenced by the actions of candidates and media? Perhaps 2016 was something special along these lines.

## Sources of Information

There is no question that for voters, the information environment of American presidential campaigns is more complex than it was only a generation ago. It has not been that long, in the grand scheme of things, since there were only three major television networks each with a nightly news show. There were multiple newspapers in large cities, giving some choice of what to read, but a pretty limited one. Campaigns made use of television ads and direct mail, as well as phone calls and volunteer door knockers—known as canvassers—to get the word out. So we would not suggest there was no complexity in the pre-Internet age.

However, the rise of the Internet, of social media, and the fracturing of the traditional media outlets have made things more complex for voters and for campaigns in recent years. Voters have a massive number of choices about where to get information, while campaigns can now micro-target voters in a way only dreamed of a few years back. The Internet has the contradictory effects of making decision-making more difficult because of the proliferation of information it facilitates, but also easier because voters can search for exactly what they want, from information sources that never disappear. The Internet and the social media networking websites undoubtedly increase the variance in levels of political knowledge. Some people make extremely large gains in political knowledge when spending time online, while others experience a _decrease_ in knowledge because, attention being finite, they end up paying more attention to non-political content more easily than they could before when they depended on mass media outlets. However, there has been no observable change in the _average_ level of political information retained by citizens, though they have broader access to a range of information sources.[^12]

## Public Opinion Polls

In 2016, campaign coverage was saturated with information from public opinion polls. This may have meant that it was more difficult to discern whether the closeness of the election made it worth their time to vote. There was a distinct overconfidence on the part of the voting public in the expected result of the election, undoubtedly inspired by numerous public polls and the news stories about them. The American National Election Study first began asking voters if they think the presidential election would be close in 1952. For most of that time, large shares of Americans were unwilling or unable to offer a prediction. But starting in 2012, nearly everyone made a prediction with high levels of confidence.[^13]

A similar dynamic was in play in 2016. The polls were as accurate as they have ever been for the national popular vote.[^14] And while the 2016 national popular vote polls suggested a relatively close election (with Clinton the winner), state-by-state Electoral College models showed Clinton with what seemed like an insurmountable lead. The modelers were always careful to assign probabilities to Clinton’s victory, but those probabilities were 70 percent or higher for much of the time. It is well established that people have trouble with recognizing what probabilities mean, and in the case of high values, will assign unwarranted certainty to an estimate. For most of us, 70 percent looks not just like a landslide, but like a virtual certainty. But think of it this way: If the election were held ten times, Trump would win three of them. Media coverage of polls, such as a daily _HuffPost_ prediction disseminated over Twitter, provided so much information that it increased the relative opportunity cost of voting.[^15] How? Potential Clinton voters might feel less reason to turn out because their vote really wouldn’t make any difference,[^16] and potential Trump voters would feel more reason to turn out, perhaps “to prove the polls wrong.”[^17] In this way, voters were able to access and experience an information overload about the state of the race that potentially paralyzed effective decision-making in new ways. On the other hand, the ease with which an information search could be conducted about general election trends was dramatically increased.

## October Surprise

In the parlance of American politics, an “October Surprise” is an event or news story that disrupts the continuity of the public perception of candidates and campaigns in close proximity to voting day. The 2016 campaign featured arguably two “October Surprises.”[^18] First, on October 7, a video recorded in 2005 was obtained by _The Washington Post_ featuring Trump describing his propensity to engage in sexual contact with women without consent. These statements earned widespread condemnation from Democrats and Republicans alike.[^19] The stories temporarily hurt his poll numbers, and Clinton opened up what seemed to be an insurmountable lead,[^20] causing the Clinton campaign to sharpen their message about Trump’s “temperament” and shift campaign resources to other states in hopes of achieving a broader victory.[^21] Instead of making sure she had a solid lead in places like Michigan and Wisconsin, the campaign focused more on Arizona, Missouri, and Indiana—states she was unlikely to win, and which were not necessary for an Electoral College victory if more reliably Democratic states stayed in her corner. Shortly after the tape was released, several additional women claimed Trump had made unwanted sexual advances on them as well, causing the story to “have legs,” as they say in the newsroom, and stay in national consciousness for several weeks.[^22]

These trends were abruptly reversed with the release of private emails of Clinton’s campaign manager, John Podesta, on WikiLeaks, and, perhaps more importantly, a letter to Congress by FBI director James Comey on October 28. The letter detailed new developments in the investigation into former Congressman Anthony Weiner who allegedly engaged in inappropriate electronic communication with a minor. Emails from Hillary Clinton, when she was Secretary of State, were found on Weiner’s laptop, and the FBI felt it necessary to make certain there were no new emails in need of vetting.[^23] Weiner had been married to senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin, which was the mechanism by which the emails came to be on his laptop. The media coverage of Comey’s letter (and the Trump campaign’s spin on it) made it seem to the public that Clinton was still under investigation by the FBI, which was not true. This coverage clearly altered the landscape of the election. Although the FBI cleared Clinton again a few days prior to the election, at least some late-deciding voters were likely influenced by the Comey letter. On Election Day, Trump carried late deciders in key swing states including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, and North Carolina. Only in Virginia, Nevada, and Georgia did Clinton earn more late deciders than Trump.[^24] While elections turn on so many different events that disentangling one from the other is often impossible, the information environment voters found themselves in during 2016 was highly suggestive of the importance of these two October surprises. Making sense of these twin events posed a significant task to voters who wanted to make the best decision they could.

## Traditional Media

While we continue to emphasize the rapid changes in the information environment caused by the proliferation of Internet platforms, traditional media sources played a significant role in constructing a distinct 2016 information environment. Normally, as observed by political communication scholars, mass media plays a mediation and interpretation role when it comes to covering politicians. Media outlets rarely feature more than a few seconds of politicians actually speaking and instead choose to have a journalist on air to explain, summarize, or interpret what the candidate says.[^25] This is part of the media’s so-called watchdog mentality, whereby they believe they are doing American democracy a favor by not allowing politicians to speak lies at length. That is reasonable, to be sure. But it can also lead the media to portray candidates as more different than they “really” are—especially by making them seem less extreme and distinct on the positions than in reality. The result can be the perception that there is not a dime’s worth of difference between the candidates, dampening political participation and confidence in government.

But Donald Trump changed all that—at least for his candidacy. Cable news channels made the decision to run footage of Trump’s campaign rallies at length and uninterrupted—a luxury not afforded Trump’s primary opponents nor Clinton.[^26] The standard practice of mediating and interpreting the statements of politicians—especially at work on evening news programs—would theoretically help to paper over Trump’s personal idiosyncrasies and contradictory policy statements. It would also have made him seem much more similar to candidate Clinton, as her ideas would also be put through this same filter. And maybe this would have aided his candidacy. But instead, his speeches were frequently broadcasted verbatim on cable news channels like CNN, which arguably made him more differentiated, and, in turn, a more polarizing figure than major party nominees in recent election cycles. Voters had better access to information about Trump than essentially any other candidate in modern America. This aspect of the 2016 information environment is perhaps the most likely to have been exceptional, but it probably reflects a trend that will continue into the next several elections—if for no other reason than Trump himself is likely to be running in 2020, and other candidates will presumably try to emulate his successful tactics.

Traditional print news media outlets, albeit increasingly digested in digital formats, were certainly part of constructing the 2016 information environment as well. As noted above, public opinion polls consistently showed Clinton had a lead over Trump in the popular vote—even as her lead in the Electoral College fell within the margin of error in any given poll. This signaled to many pundits and journalists that it was worth holding Clinton’s feet to the fire, because she and the country would be better off for it. But they became a bit preoccupied with doing so.[^27] Much coverage focused on her use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. While Clinton apologized for not following proper protocol when it came to the handling of classified information, news media kept the story alive because it was one of the few negative stories they used to balance out their coverage of many negative aspects of Trump and his campaign. In fact, according to one scholar of the news media, 63 percent of the stories in mainstream outlets were negative about Clinton, while only 56 were negative about Trump.[^28] Besides the general negativity, a smaller proportion focused on Clinton’s policy platform—possibly because it was so normal relative to Trump’s. Personality and horse-race reporting is, of course, common in political news coverage,[^29] but, again, the norms of how the information environment is constructed around campaigns potentially worked to Trump’s advantage since he and Clinton were such unique candidates.

## Political Advertising

Political advertisements were much the same as in previous years, except for a few key differences. The Trump campaign did not spend much of its own money on television ads relative to the Clinton campaign. It did tend to direct third-party advertisers to concentrate their efforts on geographically important areas. Clinton also tended to air generic ads nationally, but she was on the air quite a bit more than Trump was, on balance. However, Trump was boosted by cheap ad-buys by third parties on Facebook.[^30] These ads helped him and his allies to micro-target voters—a tactic first put to use effectively by Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. Seeing more and more ads on social media presented a different kind of challenge to voters seeking information about the candidates. These ads are generally removed from the more normal context in which we are exposed to political advertisements—television, radio, direct mail, etc.

## “Fake News”

One “new” development was “fake news.” When we talk about fake news, we mean it to be distinct from what President Trump often calls Fake News in his tweets. Instead, we take fake news to be deliberately fabricated stories meant to appeal to voters’ wishful thinking regarding their worldview in order to redirect the finite resource of attention and sow confusion about politics in order to achieve some kind of political goal. These stories appeared on websites meant to mimic those of legitimate news outlets and spread on social media networks like Facebook and Twitter,[^31] leveraging preexisting networks of like-minded users.[^32] For example, one story proclaimed “Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Trump.” By election day, the story had earned over 960,000 engagements (i.e., views, shares, likes, and comments) on Facebook.[^33] It had originally appeared on a website purporting to be a local news station called “WTOE 5” and then was shared by a Facebook page with over 350,000 followers called “End the Fed.” This was all an elaborate fabrication; the Pope did not endorse any candidate in any race.

Of course, misleading and outright false information has been a part of political campaigns for all eternity—politics ain’t beanbag, the old line goes—but the frequency and intensity by which people were exposed to fabricated stories was unprecedented. And that’s even _before_ we consider Russia’s infamous contributions to the false information environment.

## Candidate Gender

No assessment of the information environment faced by voters in 2016 would be complete without the recognition that Hillary Clinton is a woman. This election was the first time either major party had ever nominated a woman for president, and from the beginning, there was a great deal of focus on this point. Her candidacy was historic, and sexism inevitably followed. But how did the simple fact that she was a woman complicate or simplify the decision task before voters? Her presence was certainly atypical. Her gender was a new piece of information that voters would have to consider. Would it matter? Did this make her more or less attractive to voters? Her presence definitely influenced the ways in which the primary campaign worked on the Democratic side. For sure, her political legacy looms large, and this fact alone gave her an edge against her male opponents. How did it matter in the end? We will delve more deeply into this issue in Chapters 6]] and [^8].

## Conclusion

The information environment, which helps define the task demands, matters because it determines the parameters of what voters can learn during a campaign. In 2016, there were two major party candidates and several “third-party” candidates, essentially the same candidate environment that defines most U.S. presidential elections. Unlike some years when it is actually difficult to assess the ideological and policy differences between the major candidates, in 2016 this would have been relatively easy due to the polarization of the electorate—Trump’s propensity to argue he would do the opposite of what Obama did, and Clinton’s asking voters for the chance to build upon the Obama years.

A quick assessment of correct voting in 2016 suggests that American voters were at least as accurate as they have been in any election analyzed by Lau and Redlawsk’s measure. While on average they found that from 1972 to 2004 voters were correct about 75 percent of the time, in two-party dominant elections the average was higher, with the number reaching 85 percent in 2004. For 2016, preliminary analysis suggests correct voting reached nearly 90 percent, the highest across any of the years analyzed.[^34] This suggests that, as complicated as the information environment was, the task demands of the 2016 election were not somehow dramatically different from prior years. If anything, the greater differentiation between the two candidates allowed voters to clearly see who was who and to choose accordingly.

[^15]: This argument hinges on empirical claims about whether news media amplifies polls, which is certainly testable. In 2016, it would seem to be the case, given that candidate Trump himself would draw attention to any polls he felt were favorable. The media was susceptible to this overconfidence, as well, and may have transformed campaign coverage as a result (e.g., focusing obsessively on Clinton’s problems—emails; championing Trump as a scrappy underdog, and so on).

# 4Good Decisions are Rational Decisions. Or are they?]]

Ben Franklin had an approach to making decisions that has been widely cited over the years. You may have resorted to it yourself, without knowing old Ben was its advocate. Writing to English scientist and philosopher Joseph Priestley, Franklin advised him on making difficult decisions:

> When these difficult Cases occur, they are difficult chiefly because while we have them under Consideration all the Reasons pro and con are not present to the Mind at the same time; but sometimes one Set present themselves, and at other times another, the first being out of Sight.[^1] Hence the various Purposes or Inclinations that alternately prevail, and the Uncertainty that perplexes us.
> 
> To get over this, my Way is, to divide half a Sheet of Paper by a Line into two Columns, writing over the one Pro, and over the other Con. Then during three or four Days Consideration I put down under the different Heads short Hints of the different Motives that at different Times occur to me for or against the Measure. When I have thus got them all together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective Weights; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem equal, I strike them both out: If I find a Reason pro equal to some two Reasons con, I strike out the three. If I judge some two Reasons con equal to some three Reasons pro, I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length where the Ballance _(sic)_ lies; and if after a Day or two of farther Consideration nothing new that is of Importance occurs on either side, I come to a Determination accordingly.[^2]

Franklin’s “Rule” may seem a particularly _rational_ way to make a decision. We should give the decision thought, perhaps even taking an extended period of time to consider all of the possible reasons that each option might be a good or bad one to choose. Then, once we know the pros and cons, we should think about how they balance each other out.

No matter its usefulness, Franklin’s rule makes a very simple point we would be all smart to keep in mind. Making a choice—any kind of decision—is really about predicting our own future happiness. Presumably, we would always like to be more happy than less happy, or at least less unhappy than more unhappy. This is as true when picking an ice cream flavor at the local creamery as it is when deciding which candidate deserves our vote. What may make us happy, or less unhappy, may be different in kind, but the idea applies across the board.

As simple and appealing as Franklin’s rule may be, and as apparently rational as it seems, it is not quite what decision theorists mean by rational decision-making. Rationality is defined by a process which, when followed correctly, leads by definition to the “best” possible outcome. Actually, that’s not exactly right. The process must lead to the greatest _likelihood_ of maximizing “happiness.” But since “happiness” is not really a precise scientific term, economists—who first adopted this rational choice paradigm—came up with the word **utility**. Utility represents a quantity of being “better off” when receiving more of something compared to less. Often the idea is reduced to money. We are almost certainly better off with $100 than we are with $50.[^3] But not everything can be quantified in monetary terms. So, we need a way to compare apples to oranges, or perhaps guns to butter, when deciding what choices to make. We may like apples, and we may like oranges, but if we have limited resources and have to make a choice, we need to be able to assess their relative values. Hence, the idea of utility as an imaginary unit of “goodness.” If we get more utility out of the apple than the orange (assuming they are the same price and we have enough money to buy one), we should choose the apple. The concept applies even to decisions about where to place national resources. Should we spend on guns (the military) or on butter (domestic/social programs?) Rational decision makers would consider which provides the most utility, given the whole picture. But that makes it seem easy.

Indeed, rational decision-making becomes more complex when we are not sure about the outcomes to expect from a decision we make, which may well be most of the time, especially in politics. This is **decision-making under uncertainty**, which clearly describes most of our decisions. Consider deciding what to eat for dinner. You would ideally like to eat the tastiest thing possible, as it provides more happiness. Let’s say your favorite food is steak. If you limit yourself to restaurants within a relatively confined geographic area, how might you increase your chances (that is, the probability) of eating the best steak for dinner? A rational strategy might be: seek out all the reviews (information) about nearby restaurants in order to select the fanciest restaurant—which is what one of our spouses tries to do. Or maybe you seek out the one with the highest prices. Once you’re at the table, which steak do you select? A good bet is to select the filet mignon if cost is no object. How confident are you that you have selected the steak that will maximize your happiness? In the end, you cannot be certain that you have ordered the best steak in town. The proof is in the pudding, but the pudding is in the future: In the time between your ordering the steak and it coming to your table, the world might have changed. Not only this, but you can’t be sure of all the contingencies, that is, things you cannot foresee, such as the kitchen being dirty, the chef having a rough time at home, the cow having a bad diet. The _best_ a rational decision maker can do under uncertainty is maximize the **expected utility** of a particular choice. In steaks, you order the filet. In voting, you select the candidate who is most likely to make your pocketbook fatter; most likely to grant you more freedom; most likely to keep you safest; most likely to be most competent (as best you can estimate, given a world of uncertainty).

And so, in the end, you are still not sure that this is the best steak, and you might hedge your bet by carrying a bottle of ketchup, so as not to totally lose your bet with yourself, much like President Trump is famous for doing. In fact, President Trump’s well-known love of ketchup can be thought of as a kind of compensation against _bias._ While Mr. Trump, a denizen of the jet-setting luxury lifestyle, is surely familiar with all kinds of cuisine, he is reported to more often than not order a steak. This is his bias. It may be, in fact, that he recognizes this bias, and worries that he may get burned with a bad steak, every now and then. So, he hedges his bet that the steak will be a good choice by ordering it well done and with ketchup on the side. According to the calculations in his head, he believes the steak will be the best choice, but he can’t be sure, because he is biased _toward_ steak. Ketchup is on standby. In reality, as we shall see, many voters are like Trump, in that they always order the steak—they _always_ vote for the Democrat (or Republican)—regardless of perceived quality—or regardless of the candidates’ characters, qualifications, or values.

Even so, Trump’s hedge against his own bias reflects a type of rational decision-making process. What happens when this kind of behavior is not a hedge, but instead, a pattern of behavior that appears as decidedly _irrational?_ What happens when voters fail to follow a rational strategy at all, as they usually do? Are there alternatives that work at least reasonably well? These are among the questions political psychologists explore, and which are at the core of this book.

## What is a Rational Voter?

Ideally, a rational voter _is_ several things. She is _flexible_. She must be willing to change her voting preference based on the information she gathers. While she may enter into a decision-making process with an already-established expectation that she will vote for one candidate over another, she will not overlook negative information about her initial preference, nor positive information about her non-preferred candidate(s). Second, she is an _information seeker_. She must be willing to seek out comprehensive information about each candidate and their respective issue positions, competencies, qualifications, etc. Simply finding out the party affiliation of each candidate, or which candidate has been endorsed by the local newspaper, is not enough. She must also evaluate information _without bias_. That is, she cannot let her initial preferences (if any) influence what she learns, nor can she let preferences that might develop as she searches sway the way she processes the next thing she learns. Third, she considers _costs, benefits, and risks_ of her choices. She not only thinks about what she might gain, but how likely she is to gain those benefits and the potential costs of doing so. Fourth, she is an _expected utility maximizer_. A rational voter is someone who seeks the biggest return on her voting investment: the maximum expected utility from the choice she makes once the potential costs and benefits are calculated. Making an easy decision, or one that simply feels good, is not enough.

And so, ideally, a rational voter _does_ several things. To illustrate, we’ll return to William R. from Chapter 2]], our Model 1 rational voter. You might recall that William was an accountant before he retired, and presumably has a logically structured way of looking at the world. He knows what he values and what he wants from a politician and a political system and he is consistent about it. He has intransitive preferences, meaning that if he prefers candidate A over B, and candidate B over C, he _must_ prefer candidate A over candidate C. Any other preference would be irrational. Therefore, he is engaged in a search to find the best candidate, not the best policies. He already knows what’s best, and what’s best is the candidate who agrees with him in as many ways as possible. In 2004, he kept up with all the details of all the candidates—major and minor party—as he carefully calculated which candidate would be most likely to maximize his expected utility, that is, give him the most benefits, relative to costs. That year, he decided that candidate was the incumbent president, George W. Bush.[^4]

Just as in 2004, William was highly invested in the 2016 campaign; he again wanted to make the right decision no matter the cost. His friends know him for being highly informed about politics and the political process in the United States. In many ways, though, it was both easier and more difficult to be well informed in 2016. The explosion of information sources over the past 12 years meant he could learn _a lot_ about all the candidates from many different perspectives. And now, with Twitter and Facebook, not to mention Instagram and the proliferation of 24/7 politics TV channels, he had an embarrassment of riches. But of course, this also meant that the sheer volume of available information—not just from the campaigns and media, but from his social networks as well—might have become overwhelming, even for someone with the information processing gifts William possesses. The fact that he had retired in the interim between 2004 and 2016 helped; at least he could dedicate as much time as possible to learning about the campaign.

William constantly asked himself: “which candidate would be most likely to best serve my material and ideational interests?” He was very systematic in weighing the costs and benefits of voting for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, as well as the third-party candidates on the ballot in his state. He sought out as much knowledge about each candidate as he could, factoring in all sorts of information, including endorsements and opinions from elites and peers. He did so while comparing each piece of information to every other one, making the necessary calculations and tradeoffs to determine whether a candidate with a better position (for William) on healthcare was better (or worse) than a candidate with a better position on the Syrian refugee crisis.

In the end, William voted for Hillary Clinton despite misgivings about her use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. Not only would she make an effective president, he thought, but he agreed with her on a majority of the issues facing the country and her comprehensive vision for America. After all of his calculations, he expected he would be better off under a Clinton presidency than a Trump presidency, so a Clinton presidency would maximize his expected utility. But the whole exercise was filled with uncertainty. What were the chances Clinton would win? If she did win, what were the chances she would implement the policies that William assessed as bringing him benefits? The inherent uncertainty is what makes the process complex. Most real-world decisions, and certainly political decisions, are fraught with uncertainty. If they were not, it would be easy to calculate benefits and maximize utility. But generally, we have to not only calculate potential benefits, but also figure out the likelihood of actually receiving those benefits, which is almost certainly less than 100 percent.

In real life, such purely rational voters do not exist, given the demonic information search and calculating capacities needed. William votes according to the expectations of rational choice theory, meaning that he will make the best decision based on all the information available to him and, given the inherent unknowns, based on his calculation of the probabilities of his preferred outcomes actually happening. We can also classify William as a **prospective** voter, looking forward rather than backward. Instead of simply rewarding or punishing incumbents, he imagines, with his vast store of information, what the future might hold with each of the candidates in office. His choice best reflects his political preferences and values.

If a voter like William R. doesn’t exist, then why talk about him as if he does? Well, shortly after the results of the 2016 election were known, political scientists and other commentators initially turned to the (well-known) rational models to provide explanations of why Trump voters chose him. This is partly because of the apparent failure of models designed to predict the outcome of the election, known as forecasting models.[^5] Another part, however, is that it appeared self-evident to his detractors that a vote for Trump would not be in anyone’s self-interest. Not only was he inexperienced and of ill-temperament—at least according to his detractors—he also took policy positions contrary to those traditionally associated with Republican presidential candidates. In other words, his candidacy made it worth contemplating how one could rationally vote for Trump.

And so, the media focus turned to the messages the candidates presented to potential voters and the reasons that people gave for voting for Trump. Essentially, such accounts depended on a rational model of issue voting, where journalists assumed that there must be fundamental ideological reasons behind preferring Trump over Clinton. Beginning a long parade of articles trying to “understand” the ideal Trump voter, _HuffPost_ sent a reporter to Nelsonville, Ohio, a town that voted for Obama twice but flipped to Trump in 2016. Residents sang Obama’s praises, but argued that Clinton fell short of providing enough information to convince them they personally would be better off under her leadership.[^6] In this sense, journalists were looking for a prospective (and ideal-type rational) voting explanation.

## The Challenges of Being a Rational Voter

It is this kind of explanation, in which voters were not certain where Clinton stood on the issues, that the role of the information environment, as discussed in Chapter 3]], comes into play for a voter like William R. In making his choice in 2016, it is possible William R. found himself surprisingly limited by his information environment, in that he was able to easily find much more information about Trump than Clinton, Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and Libertarian Gary Johnson. For example, news and information about Trump overwhelmingly dominated information about Clinton across all media in the months leading up to the election. There simply was more information about Trump, and what the typical voter may have mostly known about Clinton was her email practices, not her policies, unless they looked deeper, as a truly rational voter like William would have to do to make the needed comparisons. As for the “third-party” candidates, William had to search even longer and harder to learn about them. Trump also dominated conversations on Facebook by extreme margins in every state, even blue states.[^7]

There was a saturation of information about Trump, both positive and negative, that may have allowed voters to feel they were able to pin down what Trump’s positions were, and this may have worked to his advantage. The information environment ended up helping him outperform expectations, at least the expectations that observers had about the ostensible irrationality of voting for such a flawed candidate. Spending more time thinking about Trump may have given his candidacy an advantage with voters trying to act rationally because they could better assess his impact on their futures than they were able to with respect to Clinton, without making special additional efforts to learn more about her.

As we described in Chapter 3]], so-called “fake news”—online publications containing inaccurate or fabricated information presented in a way so as to appear legitimate—played an important role in the 2016 election. “Fake news” presented a way out of the information saturation stalemate. It meant William R. may have thought he was making the _best_ decision he could while consuming inaccurate or unverifiable information. Politicians shade the truth all the time, of course, but a rational voter would understand this and look to experts and journalists to provide context. But the blatant disinformation disguised as objective information posed greater difficulties, relative to previous elections, to a purportedly rational electorate.

This should give some sense of the problem of being a rational voter. Few, if any of us, can process information the way William R. does. Instead, we should think of William as an ideal, a normative model of what voters should do, at least in the context of weighing costs and benefits and choosing the utility-maximizing choice. But even this, political psychologists usually suggest, is expecting too much. Instead, as we will see in Chapter 7]], maybe it’s simply enough to make a “good enough” choice even if it isn’t the best.

## Is Rationality Realistic?

In many ways, then, the pure rational model is a straw man of an argument, easily knocked over simply because none of us can actually behave that way. Even so, this is where some of the earliest studies in political science started; they were influenced by the idea of humans as rational actors. Rational choice models make the assumption that voters _begin_ with a set of values about the way the world works and then move on to apply these values to the voting process. Voters consider the important issues of the day and take a position on each of them. From there, a voter selects a candidate who agrees with most of his or her issue positions. The most famous of these models was developed by Anthony Downs in his classic 1957 book, _An Economic Theory of Democracy_. Downs argued that each voter could be placed along a single, continuous line moving from liberal to conservative, from left to right. Adding together all of a voter’s issue positions determine a voter’s place on this line. Candidates and political parties are also to be placed on this line, as well. Voters then rationally choose the candidate that is closest to them on the line; they would, in short, choose the parties and candidates they are most like.

On the other side of the equation, candidates try to position themselves in such a way as to capture the **median voter**_—_an abstract individual made flesh somewhat sloppily by Kevin Costner’s character, Bud Johnson, in the film _Swing Vote._ In the movie, Bud, a resident of New Mexico, is a divorced, drunk, unemployed slacker. He is completely removed from any knowledge about politics and had never voted in his life. His daughter registered him as an independent before the 2004 election, and tried to cast his vote for him, but the vote was not recorded due to a technical glitch. This meant in the movie (but not in real life) that Bud was officially allowed to cast his vote again. The catch, however, was that his late vote would decide the election, as the vote count was tied in the decisive Electoral College swing state of New Mexico. Thus, the movie details a process whereby, for ten days, each campaign works tirelessly to capture the literal median voter, Bud Johnson.

For this to work beyond the silver screen, voters must seek to maximize the expected utility of electing one candidate over another. But for voters to do that, candidates must take clear positions that will enable them to earn the maximum number of votes, just as we’ve discussed above.

But it should, by now, seem fairly obvious that this approach is less than realistic. First, for example, what if we consider more dimensions than ideology, such as, for example, religion? How is a voter supposed to efficiently adjudicate between where a candidate sits on multiple dimensions that matter to him or her? There is no straightforward way to resolve these kinds of inherent tensions within the rational voting model.[^8]

Second, in many American elections with only two viable candidates from which to choose, there are plenty of instances where voters would have to compromise some values to vote for any candidate. For example, Senator Bob Casey, Jr., a Democrat who represents Pennsylvania, is anti-abortion. This put Pennsylvanians in the increasingly peculiar situation where there was no pro-choice candidate on the ballot for U.S. Senate in 2006 or 2012. Where does that leave a voter trying to decide on this issue? And more to the point, there is plenty of evidence that candidates often do not make their positions perfectly clear. Instead, they are incentivized to regularly fudge them to attract as many voters as they can.[^9] The more specific they are, the easier for voters who do not agree to reject them. Be less specific and you can bring in voters who think they know where you stand even if they don’t. Donald Trump was adept at doing this in 2016; his way of talking and making ideologically inconsistent promises at rallies and in TV appearances allowed voters to decide for themselves what he _really_ meant.

## The Irrational Voter: Why Turn Out To Vote?

So, let’s suppose it is possible to behave rationally and that everyone does it. We quickly run into a problem. If _everyone_ is acting rationally and making sound decisions, then it bears asking: Why vote at all? What incentives are there for any individual voter to make the effort to find a preferred candidate, let alone vote? This probably seems like an odd question. After all, just because other people know their preferences and act rationally on them, why should that stop you from voting?

To understand the problem, we must first recognize that there are costs to becoming rationally informed, while the benefits are minuscule at best, in the context of large-scale (and most small-scale) elections. The rational voter must assess the value of what she expects to receive if her candidate wins, maximizing the associated expected utility. But there is one piece we have not discussed: The fully rational voter must also assess the likelihood that her vote will actually make the difference in deciding the election. This likelihood is used to discount the value of the outcome. So, for example, if you assess that your one vote has a 10 percent chance of determining who wins and who loses, and you expect to receive 100 utils if your candidate wins, the net expected value of voting is 10 percent of 100, or 10 utils. In the movie _Swing Vote_, Bud does not have to discount the expected benefits this way since he is guaranteed to be the deciding vote. But that’s extraordinarily rare. In fact, a group of statisticians suggested that the likelihood of any one person being the swing voter in the real world of presidential elections averages 1 in 10,000,000, even in a close election.[^10] One would have to anticipate a great deal of benefit coming from the winning candidate to offset such a discount. Otherwise, the expected utility, times the probability that your vote matters results in an infinitesimally small net benefit.

But we’re not done yet. Remember, there is a cost to being a rational voter, and it is not insignificant. William R. knows that cost; he has to pay careful attention to the presidential election virtually all the time in order to gather the information he needs to make his decision. So, time is one of the costs. William’s time could be spent on other things that might bring him positive utility. Not doing so means there is _an opportunity cost_ to being informed, and that can presumably be quantified as well. Very quickly, that missing utility adds up, and probably overwhelms the discounted expected utility of voting. William almost certainly would be better off if he did something other than spend all his time on the election. In addition, there are other direct costs, including the costs involved in driving to the polls, in taking time to actually vote, and driving home again.

No individual voter is likely to be the tipping point, or the person who actually decides the election. And, the costs of becoming informed are real. If you are not going to tip the election, and you are uncertain of the likelihood of the benefits anyway (since they are probabilistic), then why accept the costs of becoming informed and voting? They will almost certainly overwhelm the value of your share of the benefits discounted by the very, very small chance you’ll make a difference. So, it should be clear that the rational thing to do is to not become informed and not vote since the costs will always outweigh the net expected benefits.

It certainly seems that it is still more logical to free-ride—that is, to let others pay the cost of voting—than it is to pay the costs that William R. does to vote. But people do vote despite bad weather, long lines, inconvenient work hours, burdensome red tape associated with registering to vote, etc. This is the paradox of voting; people will do so even if their vote cannot possibly matter. The literature on turnout shows that voters are more likely to go vote when the election is perceived to be close—thus, there is a desire on the part of voters to actually influence the outcome of the election, which at least seems somewhat rational. More highly educated voters have more access to information, and thus, are more likely to vote.[^11] So, if we still want to claim that voters behave rationally, where do we go from here?

Anthony Downs certainly recognized this problem in _An Economic Theory of Democracy._ His solution was to introduce a democracy-is-a-reward-for-voting concept to deal with the logical inconsistency. He argued that there is a “long-run participation value” that causes rational people to vote, even though it doesn’t solve the free-ride problem. A decade later, William Riker and Peter Ordeshook also attempted to resolve this paradox by introducing a new term into the rational calculator formula, the “Duty” term, which transformed the rational choice model into the “ethical agent” model.[^12] That is, a voter expects a significant “consumption” benefit, personally and socially, from doing his or her civic duty and voting. This benefit offsets the cost of doing the research, becoming informed, and taking the time to cast a vote. Robert Goldfarb and Lee Sigelman refer to this as the “taste for the act of voting,” to put it into the econometric terms preferred by rational choice adherents like Downs. People gain a certain satisfaction associated with a sense of allegiance to the nation and political efficacy from the act of voting itself.[^13]

Not everyone is happy with this solution. One alternative might be to think of voting much as American philosopher, Reinhold Niebuhr, who argued that people’s votes are aligned with a desire for power, more than for the public good. Voting for the winning team would thus be associated with a sense of empowerment. If your team wins, you will be able to claim credit for, and perhaps even material gains, all the (good) things your team will bring. Such a feeling could be seen as an alternative to “civic duty” as a motivator to vote. But, as we will see in later chapters, the basic idea of this kind of pure rationality has taken a backseat to more psychologically appropriate conceptions of voter decision-making. Most political psychologists who study voting conclude that the full-blown economic rational choice models are logically problematic in the sense they are difficult to square with reality. But even the whole rational voting and electoral process, were it literally _true_, is likely undesirable from a democratic perspective. It would, of course, be good if voters had a grip on the issues upon which a campaign is fought. And it would be good if they used those issues to make their choices. But, as we will see, it turns out that our human cognitive limitations, as well as practical time constraints, make it nearly impossible for all voters to be rationally informed. Those very same limitations seem to suggest that even trying to do so can be counter-productive. Not only would this kind of rational voting require a single-minded focus on the election, to the exclusion of most other things, but it would also likely backfire, as research into information overload has shown that too much information can actually reduce the quality of decision-making. We will come back to this point later.

## Conclusion

A Model 1 voter is a rational voter, who learns all there is to learn about all of the relevant candidates in the election and uses that knowledge to prospectively make estimates of what each candidate will do if the winner.[^14] The voter compares these estimates to his or her own preferences and calculates the expected utility of one candidate winning over another. And, to be complete, the voter has to do this for every issue and every attribute that is part of the election for every candidate, and then sum across all of them to get the expected utility for each candidate. The calculations quickly get complex, but then the final choice becomes easy—just pick the candidate with greater expected utility, assuming you can figure out who it is. William R. can do just that, but nearly everyone else cannot, either due to cognitive limitations, time limitations, or even a lack of motivation to try.

Even so, those who champion this perspective see its value less in being a faithful explanation of what people actually do, than a useful model to think about how people would make decisions if they could. That is, it is convenient—and sometimes even appropriate—to imagine that actors are rational decision makers. Such an approach, that people act “as if” they were rational, is discussed in detail in Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow’s book, _Essence of Decision_.[^15] They argue that one way to think about how states and leaders act is to imagine them as rational actors, and to then ask what a rational actor would do in a given situation. Using rationality this way allows the analyst to consider a range of solutions to any given problem, and to think about how each may have paid off if selected. Moreover, considering others as rational actors provides us with grounding. If we assume other people are irrational, then how can we make decisions about our interactions with them? Assuming rationality at least creates a space within which to work to understand decisions that are actually made.

A second way to think about rationality is to think of it as a normative standard against which we can measure the quality of voter decision-making. Even if we cannot act like William R., the argument goes, we should still attempt to do our very best to live up to the standard. This seems quite reasonable, if we think about it that way. We should, like Ben Franklin, follow a set of rules in making our decisions that are most likely to lead us in the correct direction. If we deviate from rationality in our actual decision-making, as we always will, at least with a standard we will know how well, or badly, we are doing.

But years of psychological research on how humans process information has made clear that humans are cognitively limited and can only process a small amount of information at any given time. We are clearly not able to be rational in the way William R. is, but we’re also limited in our ability to even act “as if” we were rational. It is a reasonable question to ask if full-blown rationality should even be our ideal standard. A lot depends on what expectations we have of voters. There may be an alternative, more realistic, approach to rationality, to which we turn next.

# 5The Constrained Rational Voter]]

In many ways, we have been unfair to the rational choice approach to voting. We set up William R. to be an “omniscient calculator” who really can collect all of the available information and efficiently process it. Moreover, he is able to keep all of his preferences in mind while calculating the expected utility—personal benefit—derived from each of these, as well as the likelihood that he will receive that utility by voting for one particular candidate over another. William is an **optimizer**, finding the best possible alternative that will maximize his expected utility, given his preferences. And, he does it as a cool, dispassionate information seeker.

This model probably did not sound realistic to you. We struggled to make it look at all realistic. It’s intuitive to us all that people have biases, just as Trump has ketchup for his steak. But beyond this, the cognitive processes—what goes on inside our heads—are much more complicated than allowed for by ideal rationality. This is not to say that humans are always irrational or even that they regularly do a poor job making decisions. Rather, we are not wired or programmed like robots. Our brains are meant to help us to survive a harsh world, where our instincts, predispositions, biases, and emotions have important functions. It is next to impossible to completely wall-off these other aspects of our cognition when it comes to voting or any other decision we must make. When political psychologists have looked at the competence and limitations of our brains, their conclusions lead us to question not only the possibility that rational choice exists, but also its desirability.

## What Is Really Going On In People’s Heads?

In the real world, do voters like William R. exist? Are there voters out there who can at least approach the rational choice model? And wouldn’t these most informed people make the best voters? Well, the fact is that even the most informed voters—those presumed to be most likely to be rational voters—regularly make choices that do not appear to maximize expected utility. Why is this the case?

One answer is that people are not wholly aware of what they actually believe. Everybody likes to think that they have virtuous ideals that they stand. But research has consistently challenged the notion that people have **stable preferences** and possess deeply held beliefs about politics.

Often, simply changing the way we talk politics can induce people to back off of their professed positions on an issue. Consider public opinion polling. Experimenters have frequently found that slightly altering the phrasing of a question—known as “framing” or “priming”—can encourage someone to support a position they initially did not or would not take. What some researchers call the psychological indeterminacy of preferences means that citizens often do not have fixed preferences or predispositions to which they can refer, for example, when they gather information about candidates and step into the voting booth.[^1] William R. would be ashamed to hear this of his fellow citizens.

It might make sense to think that framing a question a particular way would confuse someone. Politicians have been trying to confuse and mislead in order to gain support since the beginning of time. That’s just the nature of the game. However, we know that there is still something going on, cognitively, that obfuscates the link between preferences and choices.

Sociologists Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee, in their book, _The People’s Choice_, demonstrate that voters frequently misperceive the issues themselves, their own positions on the issues, _and_ the candidate’s positions on the issues. Public opinion polls frequently reveal that large numbers of people, when asked questions about specific issues, select “don’t know” or “don’t care” if given the chance. Thus, the notion that voters are making fully rational choices because their brains are wired to do so looks very much like wishful thinking rather than a verifiable fact.

Finally, some voters might become confused by the information environment itself. Why? One theory is that people who draw on multiple identities find themselves cross-pressured. They are pulled in one direction by one identity, and in another direction by some other, just as deeply held, identity. Some 70 years after _The People’s Choice_ research into this area, the concept of identity has taken on new explanatory life in political psychology. We’ll take this up in some detail in Chapter 6]]. For now, let’s explore the modifications to the pure rational choice model that seek to improve it in the face of new evidence, rather than throwing the concept out altogether.

## The Problem of Limited Knowledge

In the first truly social-psychological approach to voting, Angus Campbell and his collaborators took up the theme that limited political knowledge was pervasive and argued that most people do not know about the major policy issues of the day. _The American Voter_ is probably the most influential book across the history of voting research. It set the stage for a widespread and long-standing assumption on the part of scholars and practitioners that not only were voters not fully rational, but also that there was little hope they would or could ever become so. Instead, Campbell and his colleagues argued that elections are essentially decided by small numbers of confused partisan defectors—the highly coveted swing voters who switch from one party to the other with limited ability to provide reasons as to why they did so.

Philip Converse went a step further and argued that citizens simply do not possess meaningful beliefs about political issues.[^2] By asking the same questions in a national public opinion poll over a number of years, Converse found a fair amount of variation in the public’s opinion on the important issues of the day, but little variation in the numbers of people identifying as Democrats or Republicans. If they were rational voters like William R., one would expect them to swing to one party or the other based on which parties and their candidates did better on these issues over time. Converse interpreted this to mean that political parties take the lead in determining voters’ belief systems. This is different from the conventional wisdom received from rational choice models that the parties and their positions are driven by the political beliefs of individual voters. In other words, for Converse, partisanship drives the positions we take on the issues; we do not conduct careful comparative analysis of the merits of legislation proposed and implemented by each party.

These findings also imply that the cognitive association of party identification with political beliefs is more stable than that of ideology_—_long thought to be the primary driver of political opinion and decision-making.[^3] Even more damning for the ideal-type rational model, voters are mostly unable to identify the ideological leanings of political parties. While some scholars have pushed back—for example, the 1976 book, _The Changing American Voter_ argued voters got better at understanding issues in the late 1960s—most of the research points toward the idea that voters do not know enough about politics to make informed decisions. This line of research into voting behavior generally rests, as you might have noticed, on what voters _are_, rather than what they _do_. But we would like to focus on what happens when voters are not omniscient calculators and are not well informed on the issues, the parties, and the candidates. How is it that they actually go about making their decisions?

To answer this question, researchers have more seriously examined the (opportunity) costs and (expected) benefits associated with voting. It takes time to vote; it might even take a nontrivial amount of money. And we mean the costs not only associated with physically going to the polls or mailing a letter, but also the cost of becoming informed enough to make a good decision. In the mind of any particular voter, it may be that good enough is good enough.

## Checking in with Anne D.

Anne D. was mostly uninterested in the 2016 election. This was the case even though history was made when a woman was nominated as a major party presidential candidate. Politics does not strike her as all that important. During the 2016 campaign, she privately confided to her friends that politicians are corrupt and the institutions of government and her elected representatives feel very distant. As such, Anne only votes occasionally. However, in presidential elections, she sacrifices some of her personal time to learn a bit about the candidates and usually goes to the polls to vote, because the president seems like an important person and position.

While Anne is a registered independent, she often votes for Democrats for president. However, she tends to only make her decision very near to election day. When she does plan to vote, she asks herself “am I better off today than I was four years ago?” If she is unsure of the answer to this question, she may decide that her time is too valuable and simply not vote—a rational decision according to her internal analysis. Moreover, she may avoid voting if the information she gathers indicates her preferred candidate is going to win by a considerable margin, since her vote won’t be needed.

In 2004, Anne voted for John Kerry based on her general sense that the economy was underperforming under the leadership of the incumbent, George W. Bush. Anne usually “votes with her pocketbook,” drawing conclusions about the performance of the party and politicians in power based on her own financial situation and the plight of the public, generally. For her, information based on her personal experience is enough and it is easy to come by. She makes a rational calculation to not spend too much time learning about politics because, from her perspective, there is only a very small risk of choosing the wrong candidate and voting incorrectly. Time is money, she says, so she does not want to spend the time needed to learn everything there is to know about candidates. She ignores third-party candidates altogether, since they have no chance of winning the election. Anne does learn things about politics, but what she learns is generally backward-looking, or _retrospective_—she connects her (recent) past experiences to the politicians in charge during that time—if she can remember who they were.

Both William R. and Anne D. are variants of the rational Model 1 voter. Rational decisions require information, and especially require that voters learn the same things about each of the candidates they are considering, allowing them to make explicit comparisons between them. As typified by William R., they need to be fully informed in order to maximize their expected utility. But, as we’ve noted above, behaving like William is clearly impossible in the real world.

Still, models can be useful. For one thing, we can use them to set a standard against which we can measure what really happens. In this sense, the rational voter model is a _normative_ model, describing a supposedly ideal voter. Lau and Redlawsk also see Anne D. as a type of rational voter, but one for whom the costs of becoming informed loom large, and so she limits her information search—rationally—to relatively easy to access information, and to an easy to carry out strategy of assuming what a party did in the past is what they will do in the future, eliminating any need for prediction. She still makes direct comparisons between candidates and searches for the same type of information for each one, for example, their plans for the economy. But the search may be about remembering what happened in the past rather than predicting what might happen in the future, especially for the party currently in power.

In effect, Anne realizes there is a point at which the benefits she may gain are offset by the costs of becoming informed, and so she only informs herself up to that point. Formally, Anne takes into account benefits and costs, and so she learns information only up to the point where the marginal cost of learning a new piece of information is less than the expected benefit of knowing more. To learn more than this is to accept costs that are greater than the benefit received, and so is not rational. In the real world it is hard to know when you have reached that point, but it is _not_ rational to act as William R. does unless you truly see little cost to continuous information gathering and expect significant benefit.

## The Retrospective Voter

While William R. tries to predict the future, Anne D. assesses the past when she decides who will be best for her over the next term. It is a less complex task to reflect on what has actually happened in the past year or so than to vote wholly prospectively—that is, thinking about what might happen, as William does. After all, as former New York Yankee’s manager Casey Stengel is alleged to have said, “prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.”

Thus, Anne is a **retrospective voter**. Retrospective voting was originally modeled by Morris Fiorina, who saw it as an answer to the impossibility of an all-knowing rationality.[^4] According to this theory of voting behavior, voters punish or reward incumbents for increases or decreases in living standards or conditions. The theory assumes that voters are “rational” in that they act to maximize their material resources. But it does not indicate exactly what measure of their resources voters want to maximize, nor is there an assumption that they have sought out and processed enough information to make a perfectly utility-maximizing choice.

Yet, retrospective voting requires knowing something; Anne cannot just be voting with her gut and ignoring information. In fact, the information environment in which she is voting matters a great deal. While she may not have looked at everything she could possibly find, a sizable amount of information could have been acquired simply by passively reading social media and the news, discussing politics with her co-workers, and so on. All of these sources of information could have impressed upon her competing reasons to believe she was either better off or worse off than she had been, and to reward or blame the party in office accordingly.

Is retrospective voting a more realistic alternative to the strict rational model? The idea that voters look at what parties and candidates _have done in the past_ as they assess what they might do in the future is reasonable, and it is much easier than guessing what the electoral winner might do once in office. Voters may act rationally in punishing incumbents and the incumbent party for making things worse, according to whatever metric is running through the mind of any particular voter. V.O. Key conducted studies in the 1940s that suggested the recent economic circumstances of voters influenced election outcomes.[^5] To follow the logic of this money-based/economic model, means that voters must gather as much information as they can about an incumbent’s competence, or his or her capacity to make things better, and _then_ assess whether it is worth the risk of re-electing the incumbent relative to the perceived competence of their opponent. Of course, they then must also have some sort of information about the challenger.

The retrospective voting model essentially says that partisan preference—whether you are a Republican or a Democrat—is less about having a psychological attachment to a group than it is about summarizing over time assessments of the two parties’ performances in office. While you can include a lot of information into a retrospective assessment, and perhaps even be a demonic rational information gatherer, Fiorina suggests a simpler version. In this approach, people are thought to be able, at a minimum, to calculate their standard of living—hence the term, voting with their pocketbook—and reward and punish the incumbent party and candidates for their having more or less money than two or four years ago. While politics may be a complicated affair, it is reasonable to expect people to be able to assess the political landscape by referring to something they use every day: cold hard cash. More money in your pocket? Keep them in office. Less money? Vote ’em out!

Assessing the risk of re-electing an incumbent can be quite difficult for even those rather politically sophisticated. Sometimes information about economic performance or incumbent competence can be misleading or wrong. It’s inherently easier for people to remember only recent economic conditions, or cast a vote based on how they _feel_ about the performance of the economy—rather than taking careful stock of the economy’s performance over the incumbent’s tenure.

When things are going well, incumbents tend to do better than average. However, for the uninterested voter, if things seem rather normal, and there is nothing much to complain about and nothing much to celebrate—for example, wages are fine, jobs are relatively secure, but the economy is not booming—then, according to the retrospective voter’s opportunity–cost calculation, there may not be any perceived benefit to voting. In 2016, Hillary Clinton essentially campaigned as an incumbent, arguing that she was the right candidate to build upon what she and the Democratic Party viewed as the successes of the Barack Obama years. A retrospective voter trying to make a decision between Clinton and Trump would have to decide whether Clinton was worthy of reward or punishment. The economy was generally in good shape, and this might have meant Clinton and the Democrats should be rewarded with another four years in office.

However, campaigning on “more of the same” can be less than inspiring, and, indeed, post-election assessments by pundits pointed to Clinton’s inability to inspire these kinds of retrospective voters to make the effort to spend the resources to go out and vote for her. It is certainly the case that in a few electorally important geographic areas in 2016, such as parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, there were many people who were economically motivated to punish the incumbent party. On the flip side, the Obama years had clearly been beneficial to California and many large metropolitan areas, and so, according to the theory, Clinton would have been rewarded for Obama’s performance in those areas, driving up her popular vote count.

After Trump’s unexpected victory in the Electoral College, Americans were treated to myriad stories appearing in the national news media about what people in small towns across the country were thinking when voting for Trump over Clinton. Retrospective voters like Anne D. were especially receptive to Trump’s message of American decline because manufacturing facilities and prototypical shops of the mid-twentieth century on Main Street had been absent from American life for decades. Complicating this explanation, however, was that, in rust belt states (regions of NY, PA, OH, WV, IN, IL, IO, MI and WI), voters preferred Clinton to Trump on the economy, yet she did not receive many of their votes. To the extent it exists, non-economic retrospection may be a factor. Perhaps voters were willing to punish the incumbent party for its policies on terrorism (especially ISIS) and immigration,[^6] but it’s also the case that it was the _perception_ that the economy wasn’t working for people like them that made the risk of electing Trump worth giving him their votes.

Retrospective voters do not need a lot of time to make a final decision, especially if they have rather simple criteria, such as voting with their pocketbook. However, if we consider non-material factors as something incumbents could be rewarded or punished for, the picture gets a bit more complex. In their recent book, _Democracy for Realists_, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels argue that voters tend to assign blame to incumbents for all kinds of things—even things wholly out of the control of our elected officials, such as the weather and the performance of local sports teams.[^7]

There is some evidence this dynamic was at work in 2016. The two “October surprises” mentioned in Chapter 3]] could have influenced a limited-rationality retrospective voter like Anne D. The infamous _Access Hollywood_ tape could have been enough to push voters who were otherwise motivated to punish the incumbent party to stay home on election day. The Comey letter, arriving shortly thereafter, was featured prominently in the media leading up to the election, and so, it makes sense that late-deciding voters were influenced by this late-breaking development in the Clinton email sagas. Trump enjoyed an advantage among late-deciding voters—those who profess to making a decision “within the last week or so” in polls—in the key swing states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, Michigan, and North Carolina.[^8]

In an environment where the economy was performing relatively well, but not for everybody, the risk associated with voting out the incumbent party was relatively low. Thus, it might have been reasonable to expect voters to punish Clinton for her email indiscretions. Voters could have asked themselves, “What’s the worst that could happen, economically, to me, if I vote for Trump?” And this is exactly what Anne D. did in 2016, even though her pocketbook assessment had been that the Obama years had been reasonably good to her. So, while Anne is a constrained rational voter, it is clear that making a decision that maximized her utility was still beyond her. The uncertainty of what would happen with a GOP president compared to the retrospective knowledge that she did well economically under Obama suggests the rational decision would have been to continue a Democrat in office. While her cost–benefit analysis is not terribly complicated since it focused on her pocketbook, and it is certainly rational to search only for as much information as you think you will need, Anne’s information search limits may have worked against her. Ultimately, she may have gathered information she did not need and that confused the decision, or missed critical information that she did need. Either way, Anne probably did not maximize her utility, as required for any rational decision-making process.

## Another Approach: The Model 3 Fast and Frugal Voter

If voters cannot really be counted on to make truly rational decisions _à la_ William R. or even Anne D., and may regularly vote against their self-interest in trying to do so, perhaps there is another rational-type strategy voters can use. What if we lower our idealistic expectations about human cognition and, instead, focus on the shortcuts and heuristics that people rely on all the time, every day, in order to get by? It is reasonable to expect that voters want to do a good job when they go to the polls, to attempt to maximize their benefits with their choices by making comparisons. But they probably treat voting like any other decision-making task. That is, they want to do it efficiently and cheaply. We call this type of voter the **Fast and Frugal** Model 3 voter. As a Model 3 voter, Teresa C. tries to act rationally but does so only in a limited way by focusing on a small set of candidate attributes which are easy for her to find and process. Again, like all rational voters, she attempts to learn the same things about each candidate so she can directly compare them and assess how each match up with her preferences. But she does so over a very small set of considerations by limiting the information for which she looks.

In the political press, how Teresa votes is often referred to as “single-issue” voting, but we don’t think that is a broad enough way to imagine this kind of voter. One way to simplify a decision task to make it reasonable, to lower the associated costs, and perhaps realistically increase the chances of making a good decision, is to limit the number of attributes that are under consideration. Rather than attempting to learn everything about every option, there may be ways to make a good choice without needing quite so much information. William R.’s approach is pretty unreasonable in that he has to learn about all the issues, even the ones about which he does not really care much. William also has to predict what will happen for every one of the candidates if they win, thinking prospectively. Anne D.’s information-search strategy is more limited, but she still has to search for information until the marginal gain from the new information outweighs the cost of acquiring it. This may well mean looking at many attributes, since it can be hard to figure out when to stop searching.

Teresa addresses these problems by severely limiting the number of candidate attributes under consideration to only a handful at most. _How Voters Decide_ referred to Teresa’s approach as “fast and frugal” voting, a phrase adopted from work by Gerd Gigerenzer and Peter Todd, which focused on how cognitive shortcuts can work to allow people to make good decisions.[^9] Teresa is “frugal” in that she need not pay attention to everything, and “fast” in that she does not have to spend all her time on politics. But we would argue she is also rational in that her goal is still to make the best decision possible, with the caveat that it will be best only in reference to the few factors she considers. Teresa does want to do a good job, but she does not want to spend much time trying to do it. The tradeoff is real for her: She could maybe do a better job by looking at more information, but then it would take more time and would not be easy. So, Teresa creates severe upfront restrictions as to how many things she learns about the candidates, rationally limiting her search of the information environment to the things she cares most about. Model 3 voters like Teresa systematically search for information, explicitly make comparisons, and attempt to maximize expected utility. But unlike Model 1 voters, Model 3 voters do not even try to be fully informed, staying focused only on the small set of issues that matter to them while ignoring everything else.

Edward Carmines and James Stimson make an important distinction between “hard” and “easy” issues.[^10] Issues become easy for a voter when they are long-standing, where taking sides requires little to no sophisticated understanding of the concepts surrounding the issue, when it is mostly symbolic rather than technical, and if the issue can take the form of ends rather than means. Easy issue voters vote with their gut; that is, their instincts seem to take over when they approach candidates and political parties. An easy issue voter does not need high cognitive ability nor does he or she need to pay any attention to politics. Making the decision is simply easy—to the degree that there are easy issues available. For Teresa, her two issues are “easy” since she knows what she wants and always has.

Teresa C. approached her vote in 2016 this way. She ended up choosing Trump over Clinton due to his stances on immigration and the resettlement of refugees from the Middle East, the only two issues she cared about. She was particularly interested in the impact of immigration and resettlement on national security. Like Model 1 voters, Model 3 voters such as Teresa explicitly make comparisons between the candidates they consider, and learn the information they need for the specific issues and attributes about which they care. But unlike Anne D., Teresa does not need to figure out whether new information is worth the cost of obtaining it, since she decides beforehand to limit her search. In 2016, she stopped looking for new information once she learned about each candidate on her two key issues.

All that said, the 2016 campaign was more confusing than expected for Teresa, as Trump and Clinton both had a lot of negative attributes that were dominating mass media and the subsequent information environment. This made it difficult for her to concentrate only on her key issues. As Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border of the U.S. in order to deter undocumented immigrants from entering the country, he also had to answer questions about the comments he made in 2005 about sexually assaulting women. His ethics when it came to running his family businesses were also questioned. His views on racial equality left a lot to be desired, if Teresa had cared much about this. Meanwhile, the controversy surrounding “Clinton and emails”—both her use of a private server for official government business as Secretary of State and the emails hacked from chairman of her campaign John Podesta’s private email account and subsequently publicized—dominated news coverage. The Trump campaign harped on the email issue relentlessly and called her the “most corrupt candidate ever to seek office of the presidency.”[^11] Throughout the campaign, public opinion polls indicated that between 60 and 70 percent of Americans viewed Clinton as untrustworthy.[^12]

This meant for a voter like Teresa, the perceived negative traits associated with both candidates made it more complicated than usual for her to make the candidate comparisons she needed to. So, she reasoned it would make for an easier decision to ignore all of that and just focus on the two issues most important to her. As the campaign progressed and she learned more, Teresa had the sense that she wouldn’t be missing the chance to vote for a spectacular candidate if she decided not to make an extra effort to gather additional information. She wanted to vote, and the best way for her to make her decision was to just ignore everything else going on and focus only on what she cared most about.

According to national polls before and after the election, immigration and national security issues loomed large in the minds of Trump supporters. Trump made these his top issues from the onset of the campaign. More specifically, voters who were concerned that undocumented immigrants were hampering the ability for natural-born citizens to find employment and making the country “less safe” were drawn to Trump’s tough talk about building a “WALL” to keep “bad hombres” out.[^13] Moreover, Trump’s ownership of security and immigration issues made his proposed Muslim Ban more palatable: Keep the “bad dudes”[^14] out and the jobs for America(ns) First.[^15]

Of course, the issue of immigration was also on the minds of many voters who favored Clinton—if they were able to ignore the email controversies. Record numbers of Latinos voted for Clinton. They responded specifically to what Trump proposed during his campaign. Researchers estimate that between 2 to 4 million more Latinos voted in 2016 relative to the numbers in 2012. In North Carolina, a third of Latinos voted for the first time, perhaps explaining why the Democrat, Roy Cooper, narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican, Pat McCrory, for governor, while Trump carried the state over Clinton.[^16] Such high numbers of new Latino voters—and where they reside—may largely explain both Clinton’s national popular vote victory and her Electoral College loss.

Across all among Model 3 voters, there was a wide range of issues that could have become the basis of decision-making. White Evangelical Christians voted for Trump in overwhelming margins in part because of a single-minded focus on abortion rights. His promise to promote pro-life Supreme Court justices, for example, overrode concerns about Trump’s lack of religiosity.[^17] One issue by itself made him better than Clinton. For her part, supporters of reproductive rights could easily see Clinton as better than Trump. For Clinton voters, the importance of the Supreme Court seat held open by Senate Republicans for over 10 months—an unprecedented move—may have driven them to the polls given the Court’s importance in deciding on critical societal issues.[^18] For many voters, focusing on just a few issues, like Teresa did, was enough to allow them to make a decision in 2016 and to believe they were making the best choice possible.

In 2016, women’s issues were not as salient to voters as other easy social issues, which might be surprising considering Trump’s comments about women throughout the campaign and the accusations of sexual assault made against him. As a woman, Clinton represented a stark contrast. Yet Clinton earned fewer votes from white women than did Trump.[^19] Why was this the case? One reason might be that the electorate was well informed on issues that mattered more to them than gender issues. Instead of relying on gender identity (see Chapter 7]]) to inform their vote, perhaps more white women engaged in the decision-making process in a more ideal-typical rational fashion than one might have expected. But maybe not. As we will see later, partisan identity (as reflected by Model 2 voters) may trump issues and candidate attributes. Perhaps more white women supported Trump than Clinton simply because more are Republicans than Democrats, as Pew Research data has shown.[^20]

For Teresa, Trump was better than Clinton due to his positions on the issues that mattered to her most. She did not want to take the time to sift through the allegations made against Trump, let alone reflect on their meaning to his potential presidency, and, even further, her material well-being. That makes Teresa another kind of “rational” voter type. Teresa is “fast and frugal” in using limited information, but in a rational way. She compares the candidates on the few issues and assesses prospectively what might happen if either wins. She still has to decide whether to vote using the same rational calculus described in the last chapter, but at least for her, the costs of being prepared to vote are significantly lower than they are for William or for Anne.

## Conclusion: Addressing Key Rational Choice Problems

Teresa’s approach to voting begins to address some key problems in the rational model. One is the problem of complexity. Actually casting a vote may not be difficult, but the political world generally is much more complex than voters typically understand. As a result, voters often need some way to simplify their choices. Becoming a fast and frugal voter is one way to meet this requirement.

A second problem is that if citizens are to be rational voters, they must have coherent belief systems. While we may speak highly of our unwavering principles, and commitments to things like the right to free speech, fair opportunity, or reducing the deficit, political psychologists have found that we are willing to compromise these beliefs in many situations. How does Teresa’s fast and frugal approach address these challenges? Since she cares only about a few issues, she need not have coherent beliefs across the full set of all possible issues, as William must have. It is enough for her to know about the few things with which she is most concerned.

Over the years there has been a great deal of controversy among political scientists about the role of information in voter decision-making, the ability of voters to understand politics well enough to make informed decisions, and the extent to which any rational choice model fits the observed behavior of American voters. Lau and Redlawsk’s laboratory studies did find many voters who attempted to make use of Model 1 or Model 3 strategies, so there is some evidence that at least in a controlled environment, people do want to learn as much as they can and want to compare the candidates on the issues about which they care before voting. But the same studies also provided some evidence about how hard it actually is to manage the information processing requirements of rational decision strategies. In a perhaps surprising result, they found that the voters who tried to be rational (in their studies) often were less likely to vote for the candidate who best met their interests than for others who used the limited information search strategies to which we turn in the following two chapters, Model 2 (Identity) and Model 4 (Intuitive).

# 6Our Identities Matter]]

One distinct feature of the 2016 election was the role that _identity_ played. Pundits, news media, and candidates alike explicitly referred to the concept, especially when it came to explaining why voters voted the way they did. Mostly, people wondered why citizens did not vote according to their class interests. As noted in the previous chapter]], American democracy, for it to (allegedly) work well, may require citizens to use reason to act in their own interests and to accurately interpret the statements and actions of others. Rational voters must be open to all possibilities; they must assess all available information and assess it coolly. They explicitly _cannot_ guide their assessment of the information by emotions or previous partisan preferences. If democratic politics is to be a battle of ideas and wits, tribalism complicates the process. But people clearly have existing biases that guide how they assess new information when they encounter it.

This chapter explores one of the most consequential of these biases—identity. When people think about politics and consume political information through the lens of identity, it generally raises the stakes of any given election by making it seem as though whichever group controls the government will reap all the benefits at the expense of all other groups, since politics appears as a zero-sum game. If you don’t win, you lose. While the 2016 election drew out a few types of identities that seemed to become newly salient—such as racial and urban/rural identities—partisan identity has long been recognized as an important feature of American politics, one that figures heavily in the minds of voters as they assess information and make their choice at the polls. So, as we turn to understanding what identity means, illustrated through the 2016 election, we will do so with a particular emphasis on partisanship. We will also explore other identities that seemed to play a role. As we will see, 2016 was noteworthy but not completely novel, when it came to identity politics and voting behavior.

## Of Baby Boomers, Soccer Moms, and the White Working Class

The media’s coverage of a campaign often features new descriptive labels for groups of voters that purportedly swung the election. In 2004, it was “soccer moms” and “NASCAR dads” who overwhelmingly voted for George W. Bush and delivered him the presidency. _CBS News_ referred to these terms as early as November 2003—a year before election day.[^1] In 1992, the “baby boomers” were said to have finally risen to political prominence in the process of voting for Bill Clinton. The media often search for the social groups that seemed to matter the most in order to explain the election outcome. The process was no different in 2016, as reporter after reporter was sent into “Trump country” to ask people why they voted for Trump. But instead of coming up with another bland group, the media pushed a deeper concept into the public’s mind, that of identity politics, by labeling Trump’s base as the “**white working class**” (WWC). The inclusion of the adjective “white” was an explicit reference to a particular identity that was supposedly driving people to vote for Trump.

Indeed, Trump himself made appeals to WWC identity. His campaign to “Make America Great Again” could easily be interpreted as a call to a time when white citizens—even poor ones—enjoyed economic, social, and political advantage over others. It did not really matter if voters were not _exactly_ working class; identities can be aspirational or rooted in conceptions of family heritage. It is in this way that they can cut across traditional class cleavages. The result was that a sizable number of people who readily voted for Obama a few years earlier now pictured themselves engaged in an existential battle for the identity of the country. An us-versus-them situation seemed to prevail, and a significant portion of voters felt it was important to vote based on their identity rather than (only) their policy preferences.

Trump’s campaign made it acceptable for voters to think of themselves as white voters. The thing about identity is that it has to be made salient in some way. These voters may not have thought to identify themselves with white culture in an election context, if not for the kinds of messages coming from Trump and his campaign. Previously, since at least the 1968 Richard Nixon campaign, traditional GOP candidates had eschewed explicit racial overtures, especially nationally. The Trump campaign seemed geared to overtly make race a critical identity for his voters.

Clinton, for her part, earned many votes due, at least in part, to her unapologetic appeal to racial and ethnic minorities along with well-educated white suburbanites and urbanites across the country. For her voters, much like Trump’s, identity cut across traditional cleavages that had defined partisan voting in the past decades. One example is that in 2016 (and again in 2018) many typically Republican partisans in suburban areas—generally women—defected from a party that had become aligned with Trump; Clinton attracted more highly educated whites and whites living in increasingly diverse areas of the country. The same may be said for some historically Democratic partisans who voted Republican after discovering their party was not promoting their identity interests through its focus on multiculturalism and greater opportunity for non-whites. One thing is clear about identity: it’s complicated.

The media focus on the 2016 campaign and its aftermath suggested to political scientists that more attention needed to be paid to the role identity plays in making a decision at the polls. The traditional focus on partisanship as an overarching explanation for how people voted did not seem as credible in this election as it had been in the past. This was in part due to the increasing prominence of implicit and explicit references to racial and gender identity made by both the Clinton and Trump campaigns and their supporters. In the past, political scientists could readily dismiss the import and impact of vacuous media signifiers like “soccer moms” on the basis of data showing the pervasiveness of partisan voting. But, while partisanship certainly mattered, the 2016 election reinforced the need to take a more encompassing look at identity beyond partisan identity. This time the media-applied label (white working class) cohered with a shared identity that some political psychologists and sociologists had been studying in other contexts long before the election.

The post-election narrative was that Trump pulled the right identity levers to win, while Clinton did not. Specifically, as you’ve no doubt heard, the narrative said that Clinton did not do enough to appeal to portions of the white working class that had voted for Barack Obama in 2012 but turned to Trump in 2016. The general media takeaway was that rather than appealing to broader constituencies and cleavages based on socioeconomic class, the Democrats spent far too much time talking about social identity. The logical inference was that focusing on equality for underrepresented minority groups cost Clinton the support of those who were unhappy with these appeals. However, the Democratic Party campaign platform might appeal to WWC citizens; the party’s policy positions on education and health were well-suited to address the concerns of these Americans, so their support might simply be rational. Instead, perhaps, the Democrats’ focus on social identity was off-putting to these voters.

There was an alternative on hand for those WWC voters whose identities had become critical to their voting decision. Trump and his Republican allies were quite unsubtle about making appeals to a white working-class identity. When pressed, they claimed they were trying to address those left behind economically—the genesis of the term “economic anxiety” (more on that in Chapter 8]]). And so, because Trump _won_ the election, there was less criticism of his campaign’s strategy to appeal to white Americans who felt like “their country” (a reference to the way things were in the 1950s) was being taken from them by “illegal aliens,” the “cosmopolitan elite,” and “globalists.” In “the swamp” of Washington, DC, “career politicians” (elected officials) were not looking out for their interests, but instead were turning their attention to the “urban carnage” (predominantly African-American neighborhoods) in areas populated by people not “worthy” of attention or money. Voters who responded to these messages felt their identity was under threat, and they were urged to vote for Trump to protect it.

## Identity Politics

But what do we mean when we talk about **identity politics**? For one, identity politics stands in contrast with abstract ideas about _who_ is being represented by elected politicians. It emphasizes that, rather than representing the (non-existent) median voter, politicians claim they will represent the interests of groups of citizens defined by shared characteristics, no matter their particular situations, problems, socioeconomic circumstances, views on the issues, or ideological orientation. As a representative strategy, it lumps together all people of a particular _kind_, rather than of an ideological outlook.

It is in this way that the Democratic Party was accused of representing _only_ the interests of underrepresented minority groups, while Republicans were accused of representing _only_ the interests of white people. Many 2016 observers noted that the public’s attention to policy was seemingly lower than in recent elections. While identity may seem like thin grounds to build a political agenda for an entire country, political scientists and political psychologists have long recognized that significant numbers of citizens vote one way or another because they _personally identify_ with a political party. The 2016 presidential election campaign saw the expansion of patterns of partisan identity politics into other identity categories.

## Model 2: Partisan Identity—The Traditional View

One of the maxims of political psychologists is that “partisanship is a hell-uv-a drug.” From the earliest days of _The American Voter_, researchers have consistently found that voters are willing to defect from their political leanings to vote for the candidate that is a member of their party. In other words, the pull of partisanship—as an identity—was found to be more powerful than the pull of personal preferences on ideology or the issues of the day. This is borne out by a consistent finding in the American National Election Studies: With rare exceptions, such as 1972 when many Democrats supported Nixon against a very liberal George McGovern, about 9 in 10 Republicans vote for the GOP presidential candidates while a similar share of Democrats vote for their party. Thus, those voters who have a partisan identity appear to use it regularly to guide their presidential vote.

For many decades, political identity was understood by political science scholars as simply partisan identity. Such voters, they said, simply gathered enough information about the candidates to confirm who was their party’s candidate, and assuming they did not learn anything earthshaking, they then voted for that candidate. The idea here is that information search served only to _confirm_ a preexisting preference, not to allow careful comparisons between the candidates. These voters prioritize an easy decision over a good decision, but would themselves reject that formulation. For them, a partisan decision _is_ a good decision. For a Model 2 voter, information search is highly limited, very uneven (focused on their own party candidate), and acts to affirm an existing identity.

More recent research in political psychology has complicated this simple view, as is evident from the 2016 election. While partisanship still acts as an important anchor for most American voters, other identities have been activated by recent campaigns, aided no doubt by the increasing ability of technology to target voters with messages highly specific to them. So here we turn to Warren M. to illustrate the complex ways in which many aspects of identity factor into the psychology of voting behavior.

## Model 2: The Identity Voter

When we last heard from Warren in the 2004 election, he was a staunchly partisan voter. Living in the city of Detroit, Warren consistently voted for Democrats. Democrats supported policies favoring unionized workers in his area, and he was a Democrat just like his parents and most of his extended family. As such, it was easy for him to make a decision on election day: He voted for his preferred political party—the one he associated with his identity—without much regard for the particular personal details or issue positions of the candidates themselves. In this respect, he engaged in what political psychologists refer to as _confirmatory_ decision-making.

A funny thing happened on the way to the 2016 election for Warren. The factory where he worked a middle-class union job with regular hours and income closed down in 2009 as a result of the financial crisis and the subsequent economic recession. Many of his closest friends faced a similar reality. Warren moved out of the city to Macomb County, MI, where he would be closer to his extended family as he searched for work.

In retrospect, Macomb County has been seen as a bellwether county for the 2016 election. This is due to the county’s mixture of urban, suburban, and rural communities, its broad distribution of citizens in distinct socioeconomic classes, and its sizable number of geographically concentrated ethnic groups. The pollster Stanley Greenberg started writing about Macomb County in the 1980s, finding essentially that as goes the county, so go the country’s politics.[^2] According to his focus group data, WWC voters in Macomb County have, over the past few decades, been willing to change their partisan allegiances, moving from staunch Democrats, to Reagan Democrats, and back to Obama Democrats, before turning toward Trump. Politicians themselves also have a long history of traveling to Macomb County to announce major policies. Greenberg believes that this group of voters is largely alienated from party politics, and, as such, represents a pocket of voters who, fundamentally, are willing to vote for candidates and parties that make promises to help their material and social well-being. In essence, they are voting along _identity_ lines, especially via racial and class social groupings, rather than their _partisan_ inclinations. To vote for a partisan identity, you have to _be_ a partisan. When partisanship fails, other identities may come to the forefront.

Immediately following the 2016 election, reporters from major media outlets—MSNBC, NBC, _The New York Times_, ABC, and _The Guardian_—all traveled to Macomb County to try to understand “why Trump won.” Clinton lost more votes to Trump in 2016 than Obama did to Romney in 2012, with Trump besting Clinton 53.6 percent to 43.1 percent in Macomb. He won the county by the highest margin ever recorded in a presidential election—48,348 votes. Barack Obama garnered more votes than his opponent in 2012, Mitt Romney, carrying the county with 51.6 percent of the vote.[^3] Clinton received 31,499 fewer votes than Obama had in the county, in a state she lost by a mere 10,704 votes. The dramatic turnabout of Macomb County signaled to observers that the important swing voters were enamored by Trump from the moment he descended the escalator in his namesake tower in Manhattan to announce his candidacy.

But back to Warren. In the seven years Warren had spent in Macomb County, he worked primarily in service industry jobs, joined a few civic organizations such as the Kiwanis club, and reconnected with old friends. But it seemed to him that everyone he met had a story similar to his: they had moved from the city where they had good jobs, were able to provide for their family, and finally retire with a modest pension that, when combined with Social Security and Medicare, would provide a sufficient quality of life into old age. But the jobs disappeared.

As Warren understood it, greedy capitalists and unfair trade laws shuttered his employer. But at the neighborhood social club, his friends would say they heard that immigrants were coming into the country illegally, taking jobs, and taking advantage of the welfare system. They resented the notion that they had paid their share into social security when they were working, but that others would receive that money. Warren’s elderly godmother expressed outrage when she heard from someone—who heard from someone—that Medicare was in imminent danger of going bankrupt because funds were being diverted into Obamacare programs that provided free doctor’s appointments and medications to those she believed were lazy, unemployed, and violent people living in Detroit, Chicago, and San Francisco. Warren’s friends and extended family were certain that Democrats wanted it this way; they went out of their way to make sure that rural, working-class, white Americans would lose their jobs, their Social Security benefits, and their towns to China, to poor black people, and to crime-prone Latinos. While not every Trump voter felt this way, surveys showed a significant number did.

For his part, Warren could understand this resentment because his pension had been significantly cut during his former employer’s bankruptcy negotiation. He witnessed first-hand how the stockholders and CEOs made money while he lost his job. His talks with his friends in Macomb helped him come to the personal opinion that the bailouts for the auto manufacturers and financial institutions were meant to help the executives and rich people who could afford to invest in the stock market, not the workers. It began to feel like his elected representatives were not truly on his side, after all. Maybe _big city_ Democrats were not all they were cracked up to be,[^4] even as he voted for them as a matter of routine.

Under normal circumstances, all of these thoughts wouldn’t be enough to sway a partisan identity voter like Warren. Partisan identities are strong! Discovering one’s own party’s position on an issue quite often determines the opinion the partisan has, rather than the other way around. But Warren’s move to the country from the city made him aware of his _other_ identities. In this new social setting, and in the early 2010’s political information environment, these identities became more salient.

Sociologists like Paul Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, and Hazel Gaudet might have said that Warren was increasingly _cross-pressured_ by other identities.[^5] What mattered to him most while he was living in the city was that he was a union member and a lifelong Democrat. These two identities were rarely in tension with one another. In fact, they reinforced one another. Certainly, his other identities were important to him, but they didn’t become salient to his political thinking until he moved. By the time the 2016 election rolled around, not only was Warren cross-pressured, but nearly all of his identities seemed to no longer align with the Democratic Party. Rather, they aligned with the Republican Party—especially one led by Donald Trump. The oft-noted increasing partisan polarization among Americans has seeped into other identity categories.[^6] In 2016, his new sense of identity led Warren to vote Republican for the first time.

What are the most politically salient identities, and how do they affect our voting behavior? We all have multiple identities, and Warren is not the only one who feels these kinds of cross-pressures when our political sense of self is unsettled. Voters always have multiple salient identities that may be in conflict. The cognitive task is to sort them out in order to arrive at a decision in the voting booth. What we see today in the United States, however, is that identities are increasingly aligning (e.g., one identity follows from another, to another, and so forth), which has the effect of reducing the cognitive task of this sorting. This may also be why so much more attention was paid to identity politics in 2016: It was much easier to see.[^7]

## Socialization, Motivated Reasoning, and Partisanship

_The American Voter_ argued that partisanship was all but inherited at birth. This theory was inherited from socialization theory, which argues that we tend to follow in the footsteps of our parents and adopt their political outlook. Sure, almost everyone goes through a rebellious stage in their teenage years. But, in more general terms, when a voter makes a decision, the choice depends very much on things he or she learns at an early age. One of these things is social identity. Because it is learned at such an early age, it tends to be unquestionably accepted by an individual. It is therefore natural and reasonable to conclude that these social identifications influence one’s political outlook. It is in this way that adherents to the socialization model of partisan identity make the claim that partisanship is a product of simple conditioning. People are conditioned to take on this or that political identity. The strongest partisans are those who are most strongly socialized, and, therefore, do not feel the need to know or care much about politics—they already “know” all the answers about what’s going on simply by looking at the “D” or “R” behind a politician’s name. Voting for a Democrat or a Republican comes naturally.

To push the argument a little further, we might underscore that it is not only partisan identity, but something more fundamental that might drive voting behavior. Individuals are members of social groups, and the identities they take on from these groups are crucial to understanding the process of making a choice. At the same time, we should be skeptical of those pundits who claim that identity _exclusively_ drives voters’ decision-making processes. It is important to keep in mind that although these identities always exist in some abstract way, particular ones come to matter—especially for our political identities—more or less in particular moments. That is, political psychologists generally do not believe that we go from point _a_ to point _b_, from _identity_ to the _vote_, directly. Many of the other mechanisms described in this book interact with identity to produce an individual’s decision.

Social identities must be _activated_ for them to matter politically. They can be activated by the information environment, or they can be activated by emotions, feelings of solidarity, etc. Not all of our identities are activated in any given election. One the one hand, the social groups defined by the media—soccer moms, NASCAR dads, etc.— represent an effort to explain voting behavior after the fact. Few people self-identity with such groups ahead of an election. On the other hand, candidate and campaign appeals to identity are more direct, more real, and more strategic, and are meant to activate identities from the bottom-up, in a more organic fashion. What candidates actually _say_ matters. If not for Clinton’s appeal that Americans are “stronger together”—which implies that difference and diversity is beneficial—and if not for Trump’s racially charged rhetoric, there may not have been any good reason to proclaim the 2016 election a contest between WWC voters and educated, multicultural, and urban voters. It is through these mechanisms at work in constructing the information environment that social identities transform into political identities.

## Partisan Identity and Confirmatory Decision-Making

Consider the following curious outcome from the 2016 election and its aftermath. According to Gallup in 2017, self-identified Republican voters were almost three times as likely to view Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin, favorably (32 percent), as they were prior to the rise of Donald Trump’s candidacy in 2015 (12 percent), while Democrats became less favorable, dropping from 15 percent to 10 percent.[^8] This increase coincided with the stream of reports indicating that Russia meddled in American politics during the election season on Trump’s behalf. Although partisan opinion is known to shift over time, the rapidity with which public opinion shifted gives credence to theories about partisan identity. Traditionally, Democrats have been less hawkish toward Russia. That is, Democrats, following their liberal internationalist traditions, were more willing to engage in diplomatic dialog with Russia in the hopes to persuade it to adopt democratizing reforms that would, in turn, further American interests. Republicans, on the other hand, have traditionally opposed rapprochement with Russia; this is partly due to the party’s long-standing anticommunist sentiment, but also due to its preference to use the military to solve international tension. But, as Trump promoted his Russian friendly foreign policy positions during the campaign and Democrats and government officials shared information with the public about how Russia was working to elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, an astoundingly rapid shift in public opinion took place.

In this context, we might think of partisan identity as a shortcut to arriving at an opinion on Vladimir Putin. People do not have to think about the reasons they do or do not have a favorable opinion of Vladimir Putin. They can simply refer to their partisan identity for a clue as to how to respond to such a question. Their partisan identity helps them make sense of a changing information environment.

Going a little further, however, we can say that people tend to view the political world through the lens of their partisan identity. Research on voting going back more than 60 years shows that we frequently align our values to our party rather than our party to our values, as the rational model would expect. Part of what makes partisan identity so powerful is that voters tend to alter their values based on what party elites are saying. They take cues from people in their own party as to what opinions they _ought_ to hold. Thus, rather than holding politicians accountable through rational cognitive processes of evaluation, voters are _led_ to adopt a particular perspective on politics, issues, and the world in general.

Model 2 (Identity Voter) decision-making encompasses the theories of **cognitive consistency** and **confirmatory decision-making**, which help us to understand this example of attitudes toward Vladimir Putin. How could such Republicans explain their sudden conversion? Political psychologists would argue that the change comes because people want to maintain their identity even in the face of information that challenges it, in this case, information that Donald Trump and GOP elites were far less skeptical of Russia than had usually been the case. So partisan voters change their opinions, following their leaders, in the cause of maintaining their identity. This allows them to maintain cognitive consistency—aligning preferences and beliefs—by changing beliefs to match preferences. In this sense, one of the most important effects of a campaign is to remind voters of their partisan identity. A confirmatory voter, then, is a partisan (identity) voter whose goal is to learn enough to be satisfied that the preferred candidate matches the partisan identify of the voter. This partisanship as an identity continues to hold even in the Trump era. Most Republicans voted for Trump, and most Democrats voted for Clinton.

## Cognitive Consistency

Cognitive consistency processes have been documented by researchers for 60 years or so. The basic idea is that it is important to people to maintain psychological consistency in our thoughts, and between our thoughts and behaviors.[^9] Inconsistency needs to be resolved, and we can do so in multiple ways, one of which includes revising our prior preferences. But that turns out to be hard to do. Consider buying a car. You spend a lot of money, but the car turns out to be a lemon. You can do several things to resolve this contradiction. The first is to admit you made a mistake. For most of us, it is difficult to do this. It is far easier to bring our current thoughts in line with what we originally believed. The car is still good (after all, you spent a lot of money on it). Instead, the problem is not really all that big so it can be ignored, or all cars have similar problems, or maybe the dealer just did something wrong and _it’s not your fault_. The point is that, one way or another, cognitive consistency requires congruent beliefs.

In politics, voters might bring beliefs into alignment in a couple of ways when what they learn conflicts with their prior beliefs about (for example) Vladimir Putin. Voters might elect to change their opinions on issues in order to align themselves with the party or candidate they prefer, rather than the other way around. When a candidate takes a position and voters respond this way, we call it _persuasion_. Using another example, if a candidate a voter likes is against Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), then the voter may be motivated to seek information that supports this position against DACA, no matter what their original preferences were on the issue. Gabriel Lenz conducted a study during the 2000 presidential election that found that voters were much more willing to change their minds about an issue if the candidate they voted for had adopted it, rather than admitting they had misperceived (or were misinformed about) the candidate or made a mistake with their vote. This doesn’t always have to have negative implications, however. Sometimes our chosen representatives are right on the issues of the day. Perhaps they know more than we do and we should trust their judgment. If the person I voted for is for something, then maybe I should be for it, too, and so I’ll make sure to find the information I need to justify this to myself.

Second, reversing the logic a bit, voters may _project_ their own opinions on issues onto the candidates or parties themselves. In other words, they may convince themselves that the party or candidate they prefer actually believes what they themselves believe, even when, in reality, it is not the case. This mechanism may help explain how rural citizens have become reliably Republican voters even as GOP economic policies have tended to favor the richest and most urban-based Americans. Identity as a Republican, and support for Trump, is too important to revise just because Republicans might not support what the voter wants. Additional research since the 2016 election has shown that Trump voters were willing to support whatever policy Trump supports—no matter if the policy itself is liberal or conservative. Loyalty to the group, in this case, the party, motivates individual opinion more than preexisting notions about the issues of the day or ideological disposition. And lest readers think this is merely a Republican phenomenon, Democrats (and independents) are just as subject to these processes as anyone else. Cognitive consistency is not partisan. In fact, independents may be motivated to find information that confirms their prior disposition that both parties are bad.

All this goes to support the notion that the specifics of a campaign or a candidate may not matter much for people who vote according to their partisan identities (or as is likely, any other identity). Someone who identifies as a Democrat is unlikely to be swayed to vote for a Republican candidate no matter what that candidate says or the positions his or her party adopts. In 2016, we see this effect reflected most in the _Access Hollywood_ recording episode. The near-universally expressed unacceptability of Trump’s behavior after the recording was released did not in the end dissuade large swaths of Republican partisans from voting for him in the general election.

## Negative Partisanship

The quest for cognitive consistency and partisan identity is also explained by **negative partisanship**_._[^10] Negative partisanship describes the process whereby partisans hold that anything the opposing party does must be _bad_. More precisely, we mean that people learn what their opinions on the issues are by negation: I am _not_ what the other party _is_. According to polling data, feelings toward the opposing party have become much more negative over time for both Republicans and Democrats. Partisans may be so disgusted with the other party, for example, that they will accept a less than perfect candidate or platform if it means a better chance at defeating the opponent.

The American National Election Study has tracked how partisans feel about their own and the opposing party since the 1980s, by asking them to rate each on a scale from 0 to 100. Over time, feelings about one’s own party have remained relatively stable, hovering between 70 and 80. However, the feeling about the opposing party has dropped dramatically. Throughout the 80s and 90s, Americans, on average, gave the opposing party a score between 40 and 45. In 2012, that number dropped to around 30.

Negative partisanship takes root particularly when partisan identity more closely aligns with other social groupings. In the current partisan media environment, voters can more easily observe this alignment, making it feel more natural to vote against perceived out-groups. Partisan voters are more suspicious and hostile toward the other party when they also perceive that their other salient identities align with their partisan identity.[^11] Among the other identities people have, race and religion are increasingly important ways in which voters identify and divide themselves, as they have become substantially aligned with partisan preferences.

Negative partisanship leads voters to lump all candidates of the opposing party together. GOP candidates also up for other offices in the 2016 election had a policy platform distinct from their party’s presidential nominee, but that did not cause Trump voters to vote for Democrats down ballot.[^12] In the Virginia gubernatorial election in November of 2017, Republican Ed Gillespie did himself no favors by adopting Trump’s platform, but negative partisanship was strong enough among Democrats that it probably wouldn’t have mattered, anyway, had he taken on a more moderate campaign tone. Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster call this the nationalization of voting. They conclude that, “at all levels of government, the greatest concern of party supporters is preventing the opposing party from gaining power.”[^13]

## Motivated Reasoning

This process of confirmatory decision-making is underpinned by a process called **motivated reasoning**. In an era of negative partisanship and alignment with other identities, voters are not only motivated to keep the other party out of power, they are motivated to search for information about preferred candidates in ways that reduce the stresses of dealing with competing preferences. Motivated reasoning refers to a psychological process that works to maintain existing evaluations even in the face of information that challenges them. While confirmatory decision-making is primarily about seeking only information that is likely to reinforce what one already believes, motivated reasoning can kick in when information that is received is unexpectedly counter to existing preferences. In this case, the information cannot be ignored, so it has to be processed in some form. For those motivated to maintain their preferences, that means discounting the new information (it’s not important) or the source (I don’t trust Fox News), or bolstering the existing preference (recalling the reasons you already have for your preference), or simply counter-arguing against the information (I don’t believe it; here’s why it’s wrong). Rational decision-making requires that we update our preferences in the direction of the new information we receive. So, if you learn something bad about a candidate you like, you should like that candidate _less_; it’s only logical.

But that’s not what happens. Instead, given incongruent information (negative about a liked candidate, for example), voters appear to become _more positive_ about that candidate. This is exactly the opposite of rational decision-making, further calling into question the basic idea of Model 1, that voters accurately and dispassionately update their preferences with new information.[^14] Why can this happen? It really is pretty simple. The mental processes of bolstering, discounting, and counter-arguing can result in reasons why you like your candidate coming readily to mind. As this happens, your original preference is reinforced, and even strengthened, as the impact of the new negative information becomes minimal, at best. The work on motivated reasoning shows that positive attributes of the candidate being challenged are more readily accessed and remembered when there is new negative information.

In addition to helping us understand how maintaining identity and existing preferences may trump new information, motivated reasoning processes go a long way to explaining partisan polarization. The effect of becoming more positive in the face of negative information is to make preferences more extreme. When motivated reasoning is operating, the result can be polarization. Faced with a challenge to your evaluation that (for example) Clinton is good and Trump is bad when you actually learn something that says the opposite, you may well respond by feeling even more positive about Clinton and more negative about Trump, exacerbating polarization.

When faced with information about a candidate that goes against their long-standing predispositions, partisan voters are highly motivated to seek out more information about their preferred candidate to confirm that he or she is the correct choice. The Internet and social media, in combination with partisan sorting, have made this task easier, especially considering the role of negative partisanship in driving information search.

Partisanship is indeed “a helluva drug.” It exerts a profound influence on how voters decide. Sometimes, it even makes us dismiss facts that challenge the positive aspects we associate with our partisan identities. Other times, our partisan identity will make us change our minds about an issue or candidate—and even cause us to justify the (wrong) actions taken by politicians on our team. So long as the other team doesn’t win, all sins are up for reconsideration and reclassification.

## Race and Ethnicity as Voting Identities

In the United States, race has become one identity category that has become politically salient as it interacts with partisan identity. We always knew that socioeconomic class _interacted_ with race, but the appeal of voting along class lines has waned over time. Political historians tend to agree that the two-party system, a unique feature of American democracy, has made campaigning and voting along class cleavages nearly impossible, then as now. Historically, white Americans were, on the whole, quite comfortable with voting for either major party. Today, however, voting for Republicans is now seen as something white people do—especially white men. Why might this be the case? What is there about the 2016 election that can help us understand it?

People do not necessarily think about the relationship between their own race and party identification in this straightforward manner. Rather, a voter like Warren M. might be thinking to himself, _people like me vote Republican_. Perhaps, _people who live here vote Republican—_a way in which geographic locale (suburban, rural, urban) signifies a particular way of life, and the people who live that way vote a certain way. Perhaps also: _People who go to my church vote Republican_. That is to say, because you belong to a church—whether you are pious or hold the same theological outlook as the clergy do—you find yourself affirming that identity and expressing it through the vote. Jobless people who resent “big city officials”: _They vote Republican, and I’m just like them._ “Being white” isn’t the cause, but the correlation; it just happens that most of the people in the groups Warren is a part of identify as white. Moreover, the correlation and interaction between race and socioeconomic status means, in practice, that we tend to associate with people who are like us, as a default. Race defines many economic and social patterns in the United States, often reducing mobility, interaction, and linkages across social groups.

Remember that an identity category like race is only one of the heavy-hitters social scientists have long-tracked. It is reasonable to expect that even though partisanship is a very strong identity, adding up all these other identities Warren feels could be enough to sway even someone like him away from his historical support of Democrats. Warren lost his job, moved to a rural area, lost contact with members of racial minority groups in the less multicultural environment of Macomb County, witnessed members of the community being resentful that a black man was President for eight years, and internalized what it meant to be a good Christian “out here”: You vote for Donald Trump.

## Partisanship as Social Identity

Warren’s shift in voting preference can be thought of in terms of a more recent approach in the political psychology of voting, where partisanship is viewed as another social identity rather than a psychological attachment learned at one’s parent’s knee. Social scientists have long debated the role that identity plays in behavior. One notable debate is about whether identity is _instrumental_—that is, people vote their partisan identity because the party’s issue positions suggest they would materially benefit from winning—or _expressive_—that is, people use their vote as an opportunity to express a partisan identity, affirming a sense of self.[^15] While other identities, such as race or class, appeared to matter relatively more in the 2016 presidential election than in the past, exit polls from the elections held in Virginia in November of 2017 revealed that 96 percent of Democratic voters voted for Democratic candidates, and 95 percent of Republican voters voted for Republican candidates. Partisanship still seemed to be the big dog.

Part of the reason for this consistency is that membership in social groups—usually of like-minded people—creates a reinforcing link between the attachment to a social group and one’s partisan identity. It might be that a person who affiliates with a particular set of social groups ends up having an affinity toward a particular party that is associated with those groups.[^16] Being a member of a labor union, for example, might make for a stronger emotional attachment to the Democratic Party, one that outlasts short-term changes in party and candidate policies toward unions. Alternatively, expressive partisan identity may be immune to arbitrary or short-term changes because voters might be voting with their identity regardless of the social and political consequences. If identity and social groups align as they increasingly do, it is hard to tell these alternatives apart. In an election, as Leonie Huddy and her colleagues point out, a “candidate facing an electorate engaged by instrumental concerns needs to focus on policy and address a range of issues. In contrast, a candidate facing supporters with highly expressive concerns [could] run a campaign built more on slogan than substance.”[^17] In a different information environment—for example, if he had stayed in the city of Detroit—Warren M. might have been persuaded by the specific substance of Clinton’s issue positions despite the hard times he was going through, economically speaking. But, in Macomb County, his newly formed sense of identity prevailed.

Political scientists have observed that the degree of partisanship or partisan solidarity increases or decreases in relation to perceived threats to the party.[^18] The increased salience of an identity relative to perceived threats has been true for other identities as well. Historically, furthering the political interests of identity generally meant joining an interest group that could then lobby the government on your behalf, rather than directly engaging in electoral politics. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), American Defamation League (ADL), the National Rifle Association (NRA), the National Organization for Women (NOW), and the American Conservative Union are but a few examples of these. The two-party system required too broad a coalition to make choosing a political party based on one’s identity an easy task.

But by the time 2016 rolled around, a lot of sorting and aligning had occurred. Trump and Clinton voters may have felt they were under some kind of existential threat, especially one colored by race. For their part, after living under the Barack Obama presidency and an increase in non-whites as a percentage of the overall population, many Trump supporters perhaps felt more aware that non-whites were a political force in the U.S., rendering racialized rhetorical appeals by the campaigns more salient. Indeed, Trump’s vote share was higher in counties where the number of Latinos had increased significantly since 2000. Some voters may have supported Trump as a way of expressing a white identity in an increasingly diverse nation.[^19]

Political psychologist Lilliana Mason calls this recent alignment of identities—something Warren experienced since 2008—**Political Identity Convergence**.[^20] People use their vote to _express_ something, not to _get_ something. They vote in _defense_ of their identity. The motivation behind such voting is to preserve the identity’s distinctiveness, not necessarily to reap the benefits of the policies put forth by the party. Stacking a _social_ partisan identity on top of demographic identities based on race, ethnicity, gender or socioeconomic class aids in the construction of an expressive political identity. This process helps explain how working-class white voters might feel an affinity toward an extremely wealthy person like Donald Trump. Multiple identities can reinforce each other to produce a feeling of solidarity that translates into votes on election day.

For example, according to evidence from the Latino Immigrant National Election Study (LINES) and the ANES, Hispanic and partisan identities appear to have converged. Latinos have become reliable Democratic partisans, whereas in the past, they had been more evenly distributed among the two parties. They find that Latinos expressing a strong Latino identity and concern that discrimination against Latinos is significant and widespread are relatively strong Democrats. The identities of “Latino” and “Democrat” align more closely and mutually reinforce each other as threats are perceived more clearly.

In the same way, Mason shows how evangelical Christian identity has merged with Republican identity to produce extremely reliable Republicans. To a somewhat lesser degree, black, secular and Democratic identities have merged to create a coalition that cuts across class cleavages in powerful ways. African Americans are another such group. Is it thus unreasonable to anticipate that a subset of white Americans might be starting to function as such a group, especially as we reflect on the 2016 election and beyond? The research suggests it is not.

Part of Warren’s thinking was due to what political scientists Chris Achen and Larry Bartels call the social construction of hard times. The Trump campaign altered the information environment in ways that allowed potential voters to come to the conclusion that the country was in decline. By appealing to “make American great again,” Trump was able to impart the idea that we were actually living in hard times, even as the economy was growing and crime was decreasing. The incumbent party was thus to be held responsible for the alleged social ills of the day.

Before closing this chapter, let’s take a look at two key bases for identities that seem to have mattered in the 2016 presidential election: race and geography. Members of different groups distinguished by race, in general, have distinct perceptions of the social and political world and the information environment by which they make sense of these. Moreover, where people live seems to have become a part of their identities as well, as we have begun to think of rural Americans as very different from others, and more importantly, those living in rural areas have come to believe this about themselves.

## Race and Identity

In the U.S., race is a significant piece of information that a voter may consider relevant. This includes both the candidate and voter’s race, and the candidate and voter’s positions on political issues that interact with race.

While race has always been an important indicator of vote choice, in 2016 it appeared that racial identity factored into the cognitive processes of decision-making to a rather significant degree. As noted above, news media outlets tended to prefer focusing on the concept of “economic anxiety” and not racial identity. So how did race play a factor in voting behavior in 2016? There are a few pathways to consider. First, a voter’s level of education appeared to interact with that voter’s race. Exit polls and other studies of the election revealed a persistent education gap between Trump and Clinton voters. Compared to previous elections, there was a noticeably higher difference in candidate preference between college graduates and those with some college education or less.

It was especially wide among white voters. Whites without college degrees preferred Trump to Clinton by 39 percentage points, while those holding college degrees preferred Trump to Clinton by only 4 percentage points. This 34-point disparity was up from only 11 in the 2012 election that featured Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.[^21] Rather than being a matter of explicit knowledge, this difference seems to be driven by a sense of identity.

But it wasn’t _all_ about education. Political scientist Brian Schaffner and his coauthors found that racist and sexist attitudes accounted for about two-thirds of this education gap among white voters.[^22] As noted above, Trump’s campaign rhetoric was often racially charged and sexist, so it makes sense that white and male identities would become an important part of the information environment facing voters as they came to a decision. Moreover, Nicholas Valentino and his colleagues found that “Whites now view themselves as an embattled racial group, and this has led to both strong in-group identity and a greater tolerance for expressions of hostility toward outgroups.”[^23] Views on race and the role of women in society led to greater support for Trump among whites with less education, and lower support among whites with higher education.

Why might this be the case? Warren M.’s Macomb County friends could be described as people _resenting_ the status of non-whites—politically and socially—vis-à-vis whites. David Wilson and Darren Davis define resentment as the “explicit feeling of animosity or antipathy toward a person or a group of people who are perceived to be unfair or unjust recipients of some outcome.”[^24] It is about a sense of the injustice that is the result of an individual or identity group receiving undeserved benefits of some kind. Racial resentment is also the result of anxiety about the special considerations (allegedly) bestowed upon another group on the basis of race. As Wilson and Davis argue in the same paper, “the racially resentful person is offended by claims of racism and racial discrimination and other racial justifications for special consideration because he or she believes racism and discrimination are events of the past and, thus, attempts to present race as a rationale for social problems, inequality, or celebration are invalid and unfair.” We certainly are not claiming that all Trump voters were racially resentful, but rather that for voters who were, a vote for the Republican made more sense than for the Democrat.

## Geographic Identity

Another increasingly significant identity category is based on where someone lives or considers themselves to be _from._ Warren’s personal journey toward the right was due in part because of his move from urban Detroit to the rural areas of Macomb County, MI. What Katherine Cramer has called “the politics of resentment”[^25] featured prominently in stories about _what went wrong_ for Democrats in 2016. For many whites living in rural areas, the information environment surrounding the election made it feel like 2016 should be a referendum on elite politicians making decisions in faraway cities disconnected from local realities. This is reflected in the steadily rising increase in geographically homogeneous voting preferences. In 2016, less than 10 percent of counties were carried by Trump or Clinton by a smaller than 10 percent margin, down from 30 percent of counties that were close in 1992. One-third of U.S. counties were decided by 50 percent or more, up from 3 percent in 1992.[^26]

In one way, voting for Trump was a response to the social construction of hard times. But a closer look at the rural parts of the so-called rust belt that stretches around the Great Lakes reveals that rural residents felt the processes by which resources were distributed were unfair. According to Cramer, white, older men resented not only the politics of nearby cities, but even the residents themselves. They did not feel they were getting a fair share of political power, material resources, or interpersonal respect. To them, taxpayer money seemed to be going to the cities at the expense of rural communities. Rural resenters felt that city residents unfairly characterized them as ignorant racists unable to make decisions for themselves; urban dwellers “just don’t get small-town life.”[^27] For her part, Clinton was not able to break the image that she represented an antagonistic political identity, despite having compelling policy solutions for rural America. Trump’s outsider status, at least an outsider to political circles, presented a salient and stark contrast.

## Gender Identity

Finally, we should consider the role that gender identity can play in voter decision-making. It would seem reasonable to infer that gender identity mattered greatly in 2016, as the general election provided voters a choice between a woman, Hillary Clinton, and a man, Donald Trump. But just as we noted that so-called women’s issues were less salient to voters than many others, gender identity did not exert as large an effect as one might expect considering Trump’s comments about women and the many sexual assault accusations made against him. Indeed, in general there is no simple or direct link between identifying as a woman and voting for a woman.

Data compiled by the Pew Research Center show that white women were slightly more likely to vote for Trump than Clinton, 47 percent to 45 percent.[^28] It is probable that partisanship accounts for that result, more than gender identity or anything else. On average, white voters in 2016 were more likely to be Republicans than Democrats. Gender identity, like partisan identity, is more cross-cutting than race or geography, but the distinctly political facets of an election tend to make voters think about their partisan identities more readily than their gender identities. Thus, in 2016, we saw gender identity play a more typical role than one might have anticipated given the candidates who were running.

Even when gender identity recedes into the background in terms of voting influence, it plays a foundational role in shaping the information environment. An appeal to a primordial way of organizing the social world, gender identity enjoys a particularly powerful hold over how we understand and apprehend the world. Many other identities and sets of cultural and political values are associated with and shaped by it. For example, partisan identity is certainly shaped by gender dynamics. That the number of political parties matches the (culturally contingent) number of genders may reduce the complexity of this interaction in the American context. Supporting the wealthiest Americans, who are usually men, may be perceived as masculine, while enacting policies that assist the poor may be considered feminine. Pursuing an isolationist foreign policy may be perceived as masculine, while cooperating with allies and rivals alike is often perceived as feminine. And in general both of these examples line up with partisanship. Gender identity matters, but not in a straightforward way, in part because of its complex relationship to other salient identities.

## Conclusion

Over the past decade, the concept of identity has become an important and prominent part of explaining voting behavior. When they become salient, voters’ multiple, overlapping identities loom large in the information environment, both as pieces of information in and of themselves and as filters that shape the perception and processing of political information. The act of voting for one party or another has also gained currency as an expression of identity. While partisanship has long been recognized as a kind of identity that aided a voter’s task in processing political information, increasing polarization between Democrats and Republicans has led to other kinds of social identities, such as racial identity, to increasingly align with partisan ones. And identity becomes most powerful when multiple identities align, making it more cognitively challenging for a voter to vote against what he or she perceives to be in the interest of his or her identity. Indeed, a Democratic voter may come to feel threatened by Republicans, so much so that a loss in an election will feel like condemnation of an entire way of life. And because distinct ways of life are tied to geographic areas, partisan identity is also tied to everyday lived experiences.

[^6]: To be sure, while we are in some ways taking advantage of a well-documented caricature of a Trump voter, these voters exist on both sides of the aisle. Alternatively, we might think of recent college graduate, Howard, from northern Virginia. Over the years, he began to think of himself as a Virginian first, a Democrat second, and an Obama supporter third. Howard, rejecting the nativist appeals of the Trump campaign, identified himself as a member of a global community of people celebrating difference and diversity, and striving to make the world a better place. As a member of this group, he responded to Clinton’s overtures that “Love Trumps Hate” and voted accordingly. After the election, Howard participated in rallies against the Trump agenda; his commitment to a cosmopolitan worldview did not go away simply because the election was over.

Whether or not Howard actually thinks “Love Trumps Hate” is not at issue. Rather, he takes the position of people with whom he identifies as part of his group, in-group, identity category, cues from identity groups as to what positions to take, and who to vote for. He identifies as someone who likes people from all kinds of backgrounds, and these people tend to support Democrats. As such, the identity voter does not need to know much information about Clinton and Trump’s policy platforms to make a correct decision. If his “team”—whether it be party, class, community, gender, or ethnicity—takes a position on an issue or fields a candidate for office, then he believes he must also agree with that position or candidate on values and policies that affect his identity. Voting for Clinton fit accordingly with his worldview. An appeal to primordial or tribal ways of organizing the social world, identity enjoys a particularly powerful hold over an individual’s way of understanding and apprehending the world—and this includes voting.

# 7The Intuitive Voter]]

It should be pretty clear by now that the idea of voters as cool, calculating, rational information processors does not stand up to even a cursory look at reality. Few voters have the capacity or the motivation to become well informed about politics. As we have already seen, some of the ways voters might address their limitations include simplifying the choice they have to make by becoming a Model 3 fast and frugal voter. Such voters focus only on a small set of what they presumably see as the most important candidate attributes. Alternatively, some voters are driven by partisanship and identity (Model 2) more than careful assessments of even a subset of the issues at play in any given campaign. Both of these approaches are simpler than Model 1, and so both are already more realistic examples of how voters make decisions. Still, they are probably not realistic enough, particularly because they give limited attention to the cognitive and resource limits we all face. So we turn to the Model 4 Intuitive Voter.

## A More Realistic Approach

It is uncontroversial that people have biases. But beyond this, the cognitive processes—what goes on inside our heads—are (unfortunately) much more complicated than can be allowed for by an ideal model of rationality. This is not to say that humans are always irrational or regularly do a poor job of making decisions. Rather, we are not wired like robots; our brains are meant to help us to survive a harsh world, where our instincts, predispositions, biases, and emotions have important functions. It is next to impossible to completely wall-off these other aspects of our cognition when it comes to voting or any other decision we must make. Instead, we may more realistically think of voters—and humans generally—as **boundedly rational** processors who collect just enough information to assure that the alternative they pick is _good enough_, if not utility-maximizing. Model 4 applies the very real cognitive limits we all face to the task of voting. To win the vote of Model 4 voters, a candidate need only be judged as reasonably likely to do a good enough job on the issues about which the voter cares.

Even the most informed voters—those presumed to be most likely to be rational voters—make choices that do not appear to maximize expected utility. It is worth repeating that researchers have found that people are not wholly aware of what it is they believe. Individuals can change their mind simply based on how a question is worded, suggesting citizens often do not have fixed preferences to which they can refer when they gather information and vote.[^1]

In their classic book _The People’s Choice_, sociologists Berelson, Lazarsfeld, and McPhee demonstrate that voters frequently misperceive, or are wrong about, the issues themselves, their own positions on the issues, and the candidate’s positions on the issues. While the book was written more than 60 years ago, little has changed. Public opinion polls frequently reveal that large numbers of people, when asked questions about specific issues, selected “don’t know” or “don’t care” when given the opportunity to select such a response. Thus, the notion that voters are making fully rational choices looks like wishful thinking. One might say that the candidate he votes for will represent his interests precisely _because_ he has voted for this or that candidate.

This information deficit is important, but it generally describes what voters _are_, rather than what they _do_. One thing for certain is that they generally _are not_ rational. If this truly is the case, then how is it that they might actually go about making their voting decisions, usually making reasonably good choices in the end?

To answer this question, we must start by taking seriously the idea that the amount of time (and other resources) it costs to vote must outweigh the expected benefits of voting. In the mind of any particular voter, good enough is likely to be good enough. Voters do not need candidates to maximize their utility. Rather, they just need them to help them become better off, or at least not worse off. Thus rational decision-making mixes with the structure of the environment—the opportunities that people have other than voting. In situations outside of voting, people are regularly willing to do just enough to get by. So why would voting be any different?

Model 4 Intuitive Voters still want to do a good job, as we assume is a basic goal for all voters. But remember, voters face an inherent contradiction: They presumably want to do a good job, but they also want to make an easy decision. The Model 4 voter resolves this conflict by approaching voting like most of the other decisions we make every day. Unlike Model 1, Model 4 starts with a realistic view of what voters can do to learn and process information during elections campaigns.

Unlike Models 1 and 3, Model 4 is intended to be a descriptively realistic model, based on work in a field known as Behavioral Decision Theory. Model 2 can also be realistic; we know identity and partisanship color much of what we do in politics. But unlike Model 2 voters, who focus on confirming existing beliefs to make easy decisions without serious consideration of alternatives, Model 4 voters do not start with a preexisting preference they are trying to confirm. Instead, they vote with a goal of making the choice they believe will leave them better off, but without putting in too much effort. To see how this works, we turn to Herbert S.

## Herbert S.—Good Enough is Good Enough

You may recall from Chapter 2]] that Herbert is an African-American who used to live in the Washington, DC suburbs, but now calls Southern California his home. He’s enjoying his modest retirement there, even as costly as housing can be. He has a decent pension and did pretty well selling his house in northern Virginia. He and his wife’s Social Security checks supplement his pension and this means that he’s comfortable, if not well off.

Herbert voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, not because of his race (which would be identity politics, a Model 2 process), but because, once he looked at his choices, he determined that Clinton would be better than Trump, although he could not tell you if Clinton would maximize his utility. Indeed, Herbert says he usually “goes with his gut” to make a voting decision with the aim of getting it done without overtaxing his cognitive capacity. But we should not take this to mean he does not care about the outcome of the election. Like most of us, Herbert would like to be materially secure. His tendency to vote for Democrats is not about reinforcing his identity as a Democrat—in fact, if you ask him, he would say he’s more an independent than a Democrat. All he can really tell you about Democrats is that they’re for the “little guy” while Republicans tend to favor the rich. He’s not quite sure why he knows this. Probably, he thinks, because he’s heard it from the media, from campaigns, and from friends over the years. But he’s rarely looked into the specifics.

Still, this does not mean he never tries to learn some details, and 2016 was one of those years when Herbert decided he should try to know more about what was going on before he voted. It was clearly an unusual year. At the beginning there were too many Republicans who declared their candidacy for anyone to keep straight unless they spent a great deal more time than Herbert wanted to invest. The Democrats had “only” five candidates, with two of them dropping out almost immediately, and three actively contesting the early primaries. This, Herbert thought, was much easier to keep track of, especially when one of the candidates was a woman. If she was nominated, Herbert knew it would be something unique in American politics—the something “different” he’d always figured he’d hear about if it happened. Still, since Herbert thinks of himself more as an independent, he decided he would let the parties sort things out, and then make his decision based on who they nominated. So, he pretty much ignored the primary, and didn’t vote on primary day in California.

But, as the general election campaign heated up in September 2016, Herbert found himself paying more attention than he usually did. Both sides had nominated a candidate who represented a significant break with the past, challenging his tendency to assume nothing would change much. Hillary Clinton, as the first woman nominated by a major party, was certainly notable. And Donald Trump, with his brash, un-politician approach (not to mention what seemed like 24/7 media coverage of everything he said or did) was also enough to make Herbert pay some attention. Initially, he thought he might want to study both candidates in detail before making a decision. But for Herbert, real life intervened. He had a bit of a health scare and had to spend some unexpected money fixing his house after a particularly bad storm. Both events, and others, got in the way of Herbert becoming a Model 1 voter for the first time.

We certainly have cognitive limitations, but, in addition, limitations on people’s time are very real. Few of us can study politics day in and day out. So, in the end Herbert fell back on the strategies people have for making intuitive decisions when time doesn’t permit an extensive information search. These strategies can include simplifying the information environment by limiting the number of options considered, reducing the need for detailed political information (and thus resolving the knowledge problem discussed earlier) by tying experiences of daily life to politics, and making limited direct comparisons between the candidates even when information is learned.

Herbert’s strategy was to pick one candidate and learn just a few things while also relying on what he knew about politics already. If nothing he learned made him think the candidate was unacceptable, then he could stop studying and choose that candidate—he or she would be good enough, no matter what the other candidates might do for him. Herbert started by ignoring the third-party candidates. While he doesn’t know a great deal about politics, he did know they really had no chance of winning. While both major candidates were unusual, Clinton’s gender really caught his eye and drove him to start learning about her first. With very little effort (really, a quick Internet search), Herbert learned that Clinton supported the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which he liked, and also seemed to be in favor of higher taxes on the rich, something Herbert found reasonable. He also knew from his occasional look at the news and discussions with friends that the economy was much better than it had been in 2008 or even 2012, something that suggested “staying the course” would be okay. While he wasn’t completely sure if America was ready for a woman to be president, he decided that wasn’t enough to make Clinton unacceptable. At that point, Herbert’s gut instinct told him a vote for Clinton would be just fine, so that’s what he did. Notice that Herbert did not make any comparisons between Clinton and Trump.

## Model 4: Intuitive Voting

We call the strategy Herbert used **satisficing**, which put simply means finding an acceptable alternative without worrying if it is the best option available. For every attribute that matters, a satisficing voter sets a minimal acceptable level and seeks information to ensure that a candidate meets or exceeds that level across the board, by focusing only on that candidate. If a candidate fails on any attribute, he or she is dropped from further consideration. Once a candidate is found who meets the requirements, information search stops and no other candidates are examined. As a result, some candidates may not be considered at all. Satisficing is pretty easy, since the goal is simply to make sure an option is good enough, that is, making sure that the choice will not hurt you. It is also easy because it requires no attempt to compare candidates, nor does it require calculating tradeoffs such as when a candidate is good on one dimension and bad on another. In satisficing there are no tradeoffs: A candidate who is bad on an important dimension is simply dropped from further consideration. It’s also clear that Herbert’s search for information was very one-sided. What little he actively learned was about Clinton. He did not go out of his way to learn about Trump, though presumably he could not completely avoid knowing something about him as a by-product of daily life during the 2016 election campaign. So, Herbert’s search was shallow and highly non-comparative, two hallmarks of a Model 4 voter.

Like satisficing, the **Elimination by Aspects (EBA)** strategy also simplifies the decision task, but it does so in a very different way. Here, the voter starts by considering the attributes (like issues, experience, personal information, etc.) that matter for each candidate. Like satisficing, this approach is not about finding the best candidate, but simply finding one who is good enough on only the attributes about which the voter cares. With EBA, a voter starts by identifying the most important attribute, and then checking each candidate under consideration on that attribute. If the candidate meets the minimum requirement, then the voter assesses the next candidate on the same attribute. Any candidate found to be below the bar on the attribute under consideration is immediately dropped from any further assessment. After the most important attribute is checked, the second most important is next, with the process continuing until there is only one candidate left. That one then becomes the choice. Note that while candidates are compared on attributes, it is not a matter of who is better. The rule is instead to select “who is not below the bar.” This approach can mean examining only one attribute, if only one candidate is good enough, or, at the extreme, it might take many attributes to rule out all but one candidate.

Why are these labeled intuitive strategies? The primary reason is that they rely on limited information search and choice is more about going with what feels right than with what might be seen as objectively best. Intuitive voters are like Samuel Popkin’s “low information voters” who rely on “gut rationality.”[^2] They learn much of their political information incidentally. For example, if the price of a dozen eggs is going up, then shoppers have a cue that inflation might be a problem. Assuming they have a minimal amount of information—such as knowing which party has the presidency—voters can know who to punish for this, or who to support if they want change. Such voters may do some targeted political information search as well, but it won’t be very detailed. They do not seem like they would be well-informed voters, but Popkin argues they act as if they are.

Part of the secret is the idea of cues, or what political psychologists call **heuristics**. Heuristics are shortcuts, pieces of information that fill in for more detailed understandings. There can be some confusion in how the word is used. For example, party identification is often described as a heuristic for voters, since there is a lot of detailed information wrapped up in simply using the term Republican or Democrat. For knowledgeable voters, these terms are shortcuts for a wide range of policy preferences and perspectives on what makes for the good life and good government. But even for voters will little knowledge of American politics, knowing a candidate is a Democrat fills in for needing to know policy details. Essentially, the voter can just assume that a Democrat has one set of preferences and a Republican another. In this approach, partisanship is less about tribes and identity (Chapter 6]]) and more about an efficient way to categorize candidates.

## Why Use Intuitive Strategies?

Most voters usually need some way to simplify their decision, given the complexity of politics and the cognitive and time limits they face. Model 1 explains what a voter _should do_ to guarantee the greatest chance of making the best decision, but it is not very good at describing what people _actually do._ Model 4 is a more realistic descriptive approach to decision-making, based on research in **Behavioral Decision Theory (BDT)**. BDT takes as its starting point the cognitive limitations humans face and recognizes that those limitations mean that we probably cannot be “rational” in the way assumed by rational choice theories.

This research builds on Nobel Prize-winning economist Herbert Simon’s idea of **bounded rationality**. Using an interesting thought experiment, Simon considered the decision process of an organism that lives on a two-dimension plane. The organism needs food and water to survive but cannot see far enough ahead in space to know exactly where to find it. The key point is that as long as an organism makes decisions that allow it to survive, it doesn’t matter if it maximizes its utility by making the best decisions. In fact, Simon shows that utility maximization can strain cognitive abilities to the point that the decisions become suboptimal and the organism dies.[^3]

In earlier chapters, we have briefly touched on various cognitive limits and strategies to overcome them. They focus on two general categories of cognitive limits: limits on retrieving information and limits on processing it.[^4]

Humans process information initially through the senses; there are many more potential stimuli than we can pay attention to at any one time. Attention is serial, not parallel, meaning that if we are paying attention to one thing, we will miss others. This is why your teachers have said you cannot both study and watch YouTube videos at the same time and expect to gain something from the studying. You will inevitably miss things either in the video or in your book. If you don’t believe us, and you have never encountered the “basketball game” example, you should go to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo](https://www.youtube.com\) and follow the directions carefully. What did you learn? We’ll not tell it here, but suffice it to say, for most people, this is a powerful example of selective attention.[^5]

So, the first cognitive limit is that we cannot pay attention to everything. Next, the things we do take in for cognitive processing must first enter short-term (or working) memory.[^6] Short-term memory is severely limited; the classic understanding is that humans can maintain about seven bits of information at a time in short-term memory.[^7] This very real bottleneck may be the most important limit on “rational” processing.

Both limits on attention and the short-term memory bottleneck have serious implications for processing information. Once information gets into short-term memory, it can then be stored in long-term memory, where it may be available for future retrieval. There is no guarantee that it will be encoded permanently, however. Imagine trying to remember an email address that you just looked up long enough to write a one-time email. Once you’re done, the email address becomes unnecessary so may simply be discarded rather than stored. But some information does go from short-term to long-term memory.

Long-term memory is thought to be effectively unlimited, with humans able to encode new information throughout their lifespans. Often, the bigger challenge is recalling that information, especially as we age. The typical model of long-term memory sees it as a network consisting of nodes and links between them. To recall a memory, the node must be activated, and the concept restored to working memory for processing. The process can be full of pitfalls, leading to significant cognitive limits on retrieving information. Retrieval depends on a whole host of circumstances, including how the stimulus was processed in the first place, what else was processed at the same time, the extent to which the connections between one node and another are reinforced by regular use, what was already in the memory when the stimulus was encountered, and how recently it was experienced. This model is known as the associative memory model and seems to do a good job of explaining why when we bring one idea to mind we can often very easily bring some others as well. But we can do so only if the multiple ideas are linked to each other in our memories.[^8] Retrieval from long-term memory is not at all perfect and can be subject to a wide range of biases.

The structure of memory suggests that we are unlikely to have clear fixed preferences for many attributes in politics. Instead, people may construct opinions when they are asked for them, rather than carrying them around fully formed. Taken together, all of these cognitive limitations combine to make Model 4 intuitive decision-making simply easier than attempting to be a Warren M. or Teresa C. when it comes to voting.

## Hallmarks of Intuitive Strategies

Recall that one of the guiding principles about voter decision-making is that voters generally want to make good decisions. But doing so is hard given our cognitive limits. Research suggests that to overcome these limits, people have developed a set of mechanisms that adapt us to the environment in which we live. This is an evolutionary process, not something of which we are conscious. And these methods for getting around cognitive limits are general in nature, not just for voting. Scholars have focused on the use of heuristics as the most common way voters simplify their decision-making. We have already introduced this idea—heuristics is a fancy name for “shortcuts” that we automatically use to make decision-making easier. As political psychologists generally use the term, the hallmark of a heuristic is that it limits the need for detailed information, allowing us to make decisions quickly, with less cognitive effort, and, in many cases, almost automatically. Discussing the full literature on heuristics would take a book all by itself, so here we will focus on a few key ideas that political psychologists have connected to voting behavior in considering whether heuristic use does, in fact, lead to good decisions.

There are clearly some risks in doing anything that substitutes limited information for more detailed information. Some researchers adopt an evolutionary approach, arguing that the human tendency to use heuristics must be adaptive. That is, it exists because heuristics work much of the time. If making decisions through heuristics didn’t work, the argument goes, our brains would not be wired to do so, since those who used heuristics would not have had a lower survival probability than those who did not use them. Thus, the use of heuristics survives rather than becoming extinct. Of course, evolutionary time is measured in eons while humans have had to make the kind of decisions we do in a technological world for only a very short time. Perhaps what worked to assure survival in a pre-technological age no longer works today, or at least does not work well when it comes to making a voting decision.

## What Can Go Wrong with Heuristics?

There is significant debate among political psychologists as to the extent to which heuristics work to allow voters to make good decisions regardless of limited information. Popkin’s argument that voters can “reason” without full information was based on the idea that everyday life provides information that can translate into making good political decisions even if a voter does not carefully study the campaign. Certainly, if you learn that the economy is not doing well because you lose your job, and you use that information to electorally punish those in charge, you are probably using heuristics with some accuracy. Paul Sniderman and his coauthors suggested another kind of heuristic, which they called “likeability,” which essentially means that if you like an organization and that organization does the hard work of learning details in order to make an endorsement, you can transfer your liking for the organization to the candidate it endorses.[^9] Again, this sounds potentially reasonable.

But potentially reasonable is not enough. Another prominent scholar—Larry Bartels—argues that evidence points in a different direction, namely, that heuristics do not reasonably fill in for detailed information.[^10] His evidence is that voters who were presumed to be using shortcuts, defined as those less informed about elections and candidates, did not do as well as those who were more informed. The best-informed voters can be presumed to do a good job, he says, because they are more informed. So, if less informed voters cast different votes from the best informed, they clearly are not doing as good a job, and heuristics are not helping them. This argument also seems reasonable, but given his data, Bartels could not actually know if voters were using heuristics, or were simply voting with no information at all, which would be a very different story.

To look at this, Lau and Redlawsk carried out an experiment that allowed them to track whether and how voters were using heuristics.[^11] What they found was complicated. First, nearly every voter used at least one of a set of five political heuristics: party identification, endorsements, candidate pictures, ideology, or viability (the likelihood of winning the election). But, second, using heuristics did not result in better vote choices for low information voters, supporting some of Bartels’ claims. However, when the political environment was typical (a liberal Democrat and a conservative Republican), _better_-informed voters could use these shortcuts to vote correctly without learning all of the detailed information about the candidates. But sometimes the political world is not what you expect. For example, like Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, a Democrat might be pro-life rather than pro-choice on abortion. In those cases, using heuristics actually reduced the quality of decision-making by informed voters. The takeaway here is that heuristics can sometimes help, but often can steer voters in the wrong direction, especially if the assumptions about the political environment on which they are based do not hold in a particular election. As Redlawsk and Lau summarize their findings on page 29 of _How Voters Decide_, “heuristics can lead to systematic biases when the reason the heuristic is generally effective (e.g., more frequent occurrences really are easier to recall; numerical anchors provided by the decision context usually are reasonable) is not true in some particular instance.”

There are two broad views on the value of heuristics in decision-making. Nobel Prize-winner Daniel Kahneman and his collaborator Amos Tversky carried out a long-running research program on “heuristics and biases” that focused on the errors that heuristics can create in our thinking.[^12] In this view, the use of heuristics inevitably leads to non-optimal decision-making; rational decision makers cannot rely on them to fix the problem of limited information. Thus, heuristics are to be avoided, and making people aware of them is necessary to illuminate where they go wrong. The problem is that we use heuristics automatically, so it is not at all clear they can be avoided even if we know about them.

Tversky and Kahneman’s research focused on three common heuristics that we all employ but can lead us away from rational decisions. The first is _availability_, which takes advantage of the associative memory structures that we have in our minds, causing us to judge frequency, probability, and causality by how available examples are in our memories. It always seems, for example, that the line we get into at the grocery store is the slow one, and we find that frustrating. But in reality, that’s probably not true, we just tend to remember events that catch our attention, even when they are not typical. So, when the slow line happens, we recall other such examples rather than the many times we whizzed through the line, and we judge that all lines we get into are slow. Availability is also influenced by how easy it is to create a plausible scenario from the information we receive. Availability can go wrong when the examples we draw from memory to compare to the new information are rare events, rather than typical ones.

The second of these heuristics is _representativeness_, the degree to which we judge something we encounter as similar to categories we already have in our heads. If we encounter a very tall person wearing size 13 shoes, we may easily make a quick judgment that the person is a basketball player since most players are much taller than average. We will categorize the person that way if we know nothing else, even though the odds are against any given tall person being a basketball player. Representativeness allows us to quickly fit something or someone into our preexisting expectations, for example, when we say, “that’s what all Democrats are like” even when it simply isn’t true. Obviously, if the categories we use are accurate, representativeness will not degrade our decision-making. But what if they are not? We may encounter a Republican candidate for office and simply assume she holds all the typical Republican positions. She might, but if she does not, we will fail to accurately assess her in making a voting decision unless we learn more about her.

The third heuristic Kahneman and Tversky highlight might be the most pernicious of all. The _anchoring and adjustment_ heuristic starts by forming a tentative judgment and then adjusting that judgment by reviewing relevant data. That actually does not sound so bad, and wouldn’t be, except that we seem to automatically allow non-relevant factors to serve as the anchor from which we adjust. In one of our classes, we regularly survey students on a number of questions, including one asking how many countries there are in Africa. Since most American students do not know the answer, they have to guess. Half the class is asked, “is the number of countries more than 20?” while the other half is asked, “is the number of countries fewer than 60?” The two numbers serve as anchors. Those for whom the initial anchor is 20, guess much lower on average than those for whom the anchor is 60. Other studies have found anchoring effects when people are asked to write the last two digits of their Social Security number and then asked to estimate a quantity. Those with lower numbers generally provide a smaller answer than those with higher numbers, even though the final digits of Social Security numbers are essentially random. Presumably you can see how anchoring on a random number can bias a decision. Now imagine how that could be used in politics to mislead voters.

While not strictly heuristic decision-making, Tversky and Kahneman also proposed **prospect theory**, which argues that how a decision is framed in terms of gains and losses influences the degree to which people will take risks in making their decisions.[^13] Imagine you have a choice between protecting what you have or potentially getting more, but that there is a risk that in trying to get more you will end up with less. In other words, you have to gamble. We place decisions in the realm of “gains,” where we are feeling good (and don’t want to risk feeling bad), or the realm of “losses,” where we’re already feeling bad but would like to feel better. It turns out we are less likely to take risks when we are in the realm of gains than when we are feeling like we’re already losing and want to do better.

Perhaps this is one of the factors that led to electing Donald Trump. Trump’s campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, suggested that America was currently “losing,” something Trump reinforced regularly with his rhetoric. When we feel we are losing, we are more willing to choose a risky option that might result in doing better, even if there is a risk that we will actually end up worse off. But when we think we’re doing okay already, we’re less likely to take a risk that might result in doing better. For incumbent officeholders, it might be important to get voters to think they are in the realm of gains so they don’t take a chance on a challenger. But if you are the challenger, you probably want voters to think things are not going well so they will be willing to take the risk of electing you. This framing effect matters in politics, especially when voters like Herbert S. are doing limited information searches and simply looking for candidates who are good enough.

## When Do Heuristics Work?

Kahneman and Tversky’s work sees heuristics as feeding into failures of rational decision-making. Others have a different take, suggesting that heuristics are adaptive and allow us to make myriad decisions quickly and without great effort. But this perspective requires that we abandon the idea that a rational decision is the goal, and instead take up bounded rationality and the good enough is good enough position. If we do so, Gerd Gigerenzer and his colleagues suggest that the use of heuristics can support “fast and frugal” decision-making.[^14] They see the satisficing approach as used here by Herbert S. as providing the framework for their “adaptive toolbox.” The Toolbox is a set of heuristics people apply across a wide range of decisions that often allow them to make adequate decisions rather than steering them wrong. In this view, heuristics are efficient and evolutionarily adaptive.

For Gigerenzer and colleagues, the satisficing strategy can be considered a heuristic. Satisficing edits the decision to a couple of key factors. But other fast and frugal heuristics work even better, if the goal is to do an adequate job while expending few cognitive resources. What makes it work is that we can adapt a set of heuristic tools to the environment we are in at the moment, making adjustments as we go, just as Simon described with his organism trying to find food and water. Gigerenzer and his colleagues suggest another heuristic called “recognition” which simply lets us recognize how something new in the environment links to something we already know, without needing to think deeply about it. In politics this could be like Popkin’s idea of gut rationality, knowing, for example, that inflation is going up because the price of eggs keeps climbing.

There are many other heuristics in this “adaptive toolbox” but those that might be the most closely connected to voter decision-making are the “one-reason” heuristics. These facilitate fast and easy decisions by using the most accessible (potentially) relevant information to make a decision. One of these, Take the Best, has been shown to apply to how voters use their most important problem to assess candidates and choose a preferred one (much like a Model 3 voter, but also relevant to the Model 4 intuitive strategy).[^15] In effect, voters “take the best” candidate on one particular issue. The research shows this predicts election outcomes as well as complicated econometric modeling. Thus, heuristics can “work” by connecting the decision maker to the specific information environment in which the decision is being made.

Model 4 voters like Herbert S. rely on limited information search, heuristics that match the information environment, and avoidance of complicated tradeoffs between positive and negative attributes of the candidates. Especially when satisficing, the outcome may be wholly determined by the order in which the candidates are considered. If a first candidate is examined and meets the bar for each attribute that matters, no other candidates will ever be considered, even if they might be better for the voter. Imagine that two candidates are both above the bar on whatever matters to Herbert S. Whichever candidate he starts with will be the one he picks, without ever considering the other. Note, too, that the use of EBA may result in a different outcome than satisficing, even given the same two candidates, again depending on the starting point. Is this a problem? It might be if we believe Herbert ought to get the best possible candidate. But it is not a problem if the goal is simply to do good enough without making a lot of effort.

So, can we say that Model 4 voting “works” if voters cannot be assured of having chosen the very best candidate? Asking if an information search strategy “works” means asking if using a given strategy leaves a voter worse off than if they had chosen one of the alternatives. We will come back to this in Chapter 9]], as we summarize the voting models and consider what we now know about the political psychology of voter decision-making.

## Conclusion

It is hard to be a Model 1 voter. In fact, it is so hard that most political psychologists would say it is impossible in a real election environment. Model 3, while meant to describe a type of constrained rationality, still requires voters to make tradeoffs, to assess information accurately, and to attempt to maximize expected utility. But it is much easier than Model 1, since being a fast and frugal voter does not require sorting through all possible information. Most voters, though, are either identity voters (Model 2) or intuitive voters (Model 4). Model 2 voters are motivated simply to reaffirm an existing identity—often partisanship, but also race or geography—choosing the candidate they think best represents them, as they see themselves. Under all of the other models, information search is in the service of trying to do a good job. For Model 2, it is in the service of confirming that the candidate who by default seems like the right one (the right party, the right social group) is in fact what she or he seems to be. Motivated reasoning processes, which cause us to automatically challenge information that opposes our preexisting preferences, work to support this. Motivated reasoners who encounter new information may simply ignore or otherwise fail to process it or to update their preferences accurately. In politics, this process may reinforce preferences tied to identity or partisanship.

In many elections we suspect Model 4 is the best description of what voters do. It is hard to collect a lot of information either because it does not exist in any easy to access format or because of the time and cognitive limitations that define most of us when it comes to politics. Model 4 decision-making is relatively easy, requiring some assessment of whether a candidate is above the bar on all the attributes that matter, ignoring unimportant attributes, and simply trying to avoid making a serious mistake. Intuitive strategies recognize cognitive limits and bounded rationality. While the result cannot be guaranteed to be the best possible outcome, as long as it doesn’t hurt, it’s good enough.

Notes

[^1]: John Zaller and Stanley Feldman described this process as one in which people have a set of “considerations” in their minds about issues. These considerations are the memories created from exposure to information. When asked to answer a question like “where do you stand on gun control?” people come up with whichever thoughts are easily accessible, and it is the mixture of those thoughts—pro and con—that define their response.

# 8Emotions and Voting]]

A significant limitation of the cognitive approach to voter decision-making is an unspoken assumption: However voters acquire information, the process of evaluating that information is primarily about “thinking.” Voters learn about candidates and then compare the information they have learned to their own personal preferences, ultimately attempting to identify the candidate who best represents them. _Thinking_ is at the core of assumptions about what makes a good and competent democratic citizen. Voters may use any one of a number of strategies for learning about their options, but equally important is the question of how they process the information they have learned. For the cognitive models we have been reviewing, identifying whether new information makes a voter more or less positive toward a given candidate is as simple as seeing if the candidate position (if it is an issue) is the same or different from the voter’s position. If it is the same, the voter should feel positive toward the candidate. If the candidate takes a position opposed to the voter, the voter should feel negative. The ultimate evaluation, then, is created through comparing candidate attributes and voters’ existing preferences. As Stanley Kelly and Thad Mirer once called it, this is the “simple act of voting.”[^1]

Up until now, this book has examined voter decision-making through various analytical lenses of human cognition. But as political psychologists, we cannot ignore the emerging consensus that emotions matter when it comes to cognition. Understanding how voters “feel” is an important aspect of understanding how decision-making processes actually _work._

We intuitively understand that emotions are important for _everything_ we do. We notice that we wake up in the morning in different moods that seem to stick with us throughout the day, and that we desire to do some things more than others for no good reason. **Emotions** constantly figure in our sense of what the future will be like, what the past felt like, and how we experience the present. We listen to particular genres of music, eat certain foods, and pursue relationships with others in part because they make us _feel_ the way we want to. The choices we make every day allow us to balance our emotions, which, in turn, enables us to cope with our hectic modern lifestyles. Emotions can be an aid or an impediment to our brain’s desire to achieve cognitive equilibrium, and, importantly, to make decisions that are too complicated or perhaps not important enough for the rigorous requirements associated with the rational choice deliberation described in Chapter 4]].

In an important way, our emotions can bias us. Our emotional commitments to preexisting information may shape what we do with new information—no matter what kind of model voter we are or aspire to be. We feel a particular kind of way about the political world, and this colors the way we process the information about candidates that guides how we decide to vote.

## Two Models of Emotions

Scholars of emotions and politics have come to appreciate that multiple emotions are important when it comes to political activity. While political psychologists have always acknowledged that _feelings_ play a role in decision-making processes, they have often simplified them into the basic categories of “good” (positive) and “bad” (negative). This is known as the **valence model** of emotion. The valence model underlies the idea of hot cognition, which we introduced in Chapter 6]], when we considered how motivated reasoning works to support identity preferences. Hot cognition simply suggests that our thoughts about the world are infused with emotion: We feel good or bad about something or someone and this feeling then influences how we interact with new information about the person or thing. We bet, for example, you cannot think of an apple pie without having some feeling about it—maybe you like apple pie, maybe you don’t, but you probably have some feeling about it if you have ever encountered one. The same is true of politicians and parties. If you are an American reading this book, we would be shocked if simply mentioning the president’s name doesn’t bring up feelings. In fact, those feelings probably came to mind even without reading the actual name.

More recent research grounded in neuroscience suggests that we must go beyond good and bad and consider a wide range of **discrete emotions**.[^2] These are the specific emotions we commonly identify as anger, fear, anxiety, contempt, hope, pride, and many others. Some have a positive valence and some negative. There is an ongoing debate about whether emotions matter in a general sense (i.e., how intense is the emotion?) or if different emotions work in distinct ways (i.e., which emotions matter when and in which ways?). This debate has led to new approaches to emotions and politics as scholars have begun to examine how different and distinct emotions exert particular effects on the cognitive processes used in voting decision-making. This chapter aims to discuss how emotions alter our decision-making processes in different ways.

This being said, we want to underscore one point. We do not mean to suggest that, although we have this chapter dedicated strictly to emotions, they are walled-off from the processes and mechanisms related to the cognitive political psychology of voting that we have been discussing until now. Rather, the most cutting-edge research into voting behavior shows that emotion and cognition overlap and interact, and that emotion may have a role to play in every one of the voting models we have discussed. It is easier for us to talk about emotions in their own chapter, but we do not want to lose sight of this simple fact.

So, we will first consider some ways emotions may have played a role in the 2016 election, and to illustrate this we’ll talk about our last voter, Bethany A. We then turn to the debate over how emotions interact with cognition, highlighting the theory of **affective intelligence**, which considers how three specific emotions—enthusiasm, anger, and especially anxiety—influence political decision-making. Lastly, we consider other explorations of the behavioral effects of experiencing anxiety and the ways in which it might contribute to a fuller explanation of the contemporary American political environment.

## Emotions and the 2016 Election

Of all the emotions that could be relevant to voting, anxiety has probably received the most attention from political psychologists. (Perhaps this is because political psychologists are among the most aware of the consequences of elections, and simply feel anxious themselves around election time.) More likely, it is because anxiety turns out to be a key emotion in modern discourse and because it has been shown to have very clear consequences for political decision-making. Moreover, as the information environment becomes more and more complex during modern campaigns, voters attempting to pay attention may also find themselves anxious about the outcome of the election. And why not? The campaign environment is chock full of claims that “this is the most important election of our lifetime.” Television advertisements regularly try to make voters feel afraid about what might happen if the “wrong” candidate wins the election—the apocalypse will be upon us! Thus, it is reasonable to expect that voters may become anxious during election season.

## Economic Anxiety

There was an increased awareness and appreciation of the emotional aspects of the 2016 election on the part of the news media, relative to other elections in recent memory. Several different variants of “anxiety” got specific media attention, but the highlight was the use of “economic anxiety” to explain virtually everything. Countless stories talked about how Trump voters were expressing their “economic anxiety” with their vote. Immediately following the election this was considered _the_ valid explanation for the election outcome and was featured prominently in numerous stories from widely circulated publications. Unfortunately, the concept of economic anxiety was almost too slippery to grasp from the moment it entered the public conversation, but we can safely say it broadly refers to the notion that “white working-class” voters (remember this group from Chapter 6]]) were so anxious about their place in the new “Obama-led” economy that they would go against their ideological inclinations, partisan affiliation, and even class- and cultural identity to vote for a Republican candidate like Donald Trump.[^3]

Trump voters were ostensibly “anxious” about their current economic standing—so much so that they were projecting this anxiety into the future and onto the prospect of a Clinton presidency that would presumably double down on the Obama economy, in turn exacerbating their anxiety. They joined with other voters who had long been resentful of faraway big city centers where, it seemed to them, the game of politics was played and consequently rigged against them.[^4] They were said to be “left behind” by decades of neoliberal economic policies that, according to this rendition of the story, redirected wealth from the white working class to the urban poor, Wall Street executives and new immigrants—both legal and undocumented. It was time for someone to pay these voters attention, again. Whether or not this explanation has held up—and research suggests it is not as much an explanation as the media thought it was[^5]—the fact that a national conversation played out in the news media about how people _felt_ about something in relation to the campaign and their vote shows how far we have come in recognizing the importance of emotions in voting behavior.

Moreover, this particular emotional lens helps us to explain one of the most unique aspects of Trump’s candidacy—his populist appeal.[^6] By appreciating that emotions matter in voting behavior, we can understand ways in which he was able to gain leverage over “economically anxious” voters (or those made anxious in other ways) by promising to relieve them of this anxiety through economic protectionism and stricter immigration policies.

## Disgust and Outrage

In addition to anxiety, media reports also treated readers to various accounts of groups of voters that were especially outraged by Trump’s comments about women and underrepresented minority groups.[^7] Two major emotional themes—disgust and outrage—can be illustrated by Trump’s first set of public remarks he made as a candidate for president. His claim that Mexico was “not sending [the United States] their best people,” and instead sending “rapists” sparked the first of many waves of outrage over things that Trump and his surrogates said on the campaign trail.[^8] Some people were disgusted about Trump’s opinions about Mexico and immigrants from Mexico. But others sympathized with his view and were outraged at Mexico and Mexican immigrants. In doing so, Trump stirred up negative emotions that could have inspired enthusiasm or apathy from his supporters and opponents alike.[^9]

Second, there were Trump’s comments about women. In the context of the 2016 election, where one candidate was a woman—for the first time—it would seem that these comments were especially relevant. Of course, there were the remarks from Trump on the _Access Hollywood_ tape that constituted an “October Surprise,” as discussed in Chapter 3]], but there were others that preceded it. Several people became Trump targets, including Clinton. In the third televised debate, as an aside to the audience, Trump called Clinton “such a nasty woman” following her comments about his stance on the government retirement assistance program, Social Security. Before that, he said that Clinton did not have the “presidential look”—when asked what makes her unqualified to be president. Later, he said she lacked the “stamina” to be president.[^10]

Critics and observers believed these statements to be demeaning to Clinton because the wording implied she was not qualified to be president simply on the basis that she was a woman. These comments, especially when coupled with his retweeting of an image that unfavorably compared Republican Party presidential primary campaign opponent Ted Cruz’s wife to his own,[^11] his remarks that primary campaign opponent Carly Fiorina was ugly—“just look at her!”[^12]—and his propensity to dismiss allegations of sexual assault by arguing that the accusers were too unattractive to be assaulted by him—“just look at her, I don’t think so … no thanks,”[^13] established a pattern and identity for Trump. He was disgusted with women who opposed him, and this, in turn, caused many people to be disgusted and outraged by Trump’s treatment of women.

Feelings of disgust and outrage also came into play when other voters encountered fabricated stories detailing scandals and conspiracies allegedly perpetrated by Hillary Clinton and her associates. The most prominent example of this _very_-2016 phenomenon was the “Pizzagate” conspiracy, which posited that high-ranking Democratic Party officials were the principle organizers of a pedophilia and child sex-trafficking ring based out of the basement of _Comet Ping Pong_, a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C. The website WikiLeaks helped perpetuate this and other conspiracies by tweeting far-fetched theories inspired by selective and cynical interpretations of the emails authored by John Podesta that were acquired through illegal means. Regardless of their lack of grounding in reality, these stories certainly contributed to the large numbers of people who were disgusted by and could feel nothing but contempt for Clinton and the Democratic Party.

## Excitement and Resentment

The campaigns were also adept at generating enthusiasm—a positive emotion—and resentment, another negative one. Trump was able to effectively combine them, breeding enthusiasm by appealing to some supporters’ collective sense of resentment. Voters became quite excited over the prospect of a president who would build what he referred to in many tweets as “THE WALL” along the Mexican border (and make Mexico pay for it), reduce legal and undocumented immigration, institute policies that would favor rural and white populations over the urban, black and poor populations, and “lock up” his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for allegedly perpetrating undefined crimes. On the flip side, Clinton’s landmark candidacy caused enthusiasm among voters who were excited to vote for the first woman nominated for president by a major party. It could be said that they resented the fact that she and other women in politics had been treated poorly by political opponents and subsequently found little support from the political establishment over the years.

## Pride and Hope

So far, we have mostly noted the negative emotions that played a role in 2016. But what about positive emotions? Although they received less attention from the punditry than in 2008 when Barack Obama explicitly ran on “hope,” positive emotions like hope and pride played important roles in the emotionally charged information environment. For example, some of Clinton’s campaign advertisements explicitly appealed to people’s sense of pride about their country and the achievements of the Obama administration with which she and her supporters were closely associated. They should vote for Clinton, they were told, because of the pride in the multicultural and accepting country that Obama helped to construct over the previous eight years. They should celebrate their identities—black, Latino, liberal, urban, etc.—and keep the good vibes going for another four years. Clinton’s campaign tried to communicate to voters that if Trump won, they would no longer be living in a country of which they could be proud.

For his part, Trump tried to give hope to those who felt “left behind” during the Obama years. Promising to “Make America Great Again,” Trump gave hope to voters that the country they wanted to live in was not forever gone; it was, in fact, possible to (re)create what the country once was. This, of course, interacted with the same voters’ sense of resentment, but the positive emotional side to the appeal to lost greatness helped to motivate anxious voters to go out and actually cast their vote.

## Bethany A.: The Emotions Voter

You might recall that when Bethany A. was introduced back in Chapter 2]], we said that 2016 was her first election, and she certainly wanted to do as good a job as possible. She was in her first job as an actuary, which puts a premium on quantitative reasoning, the same kind of skills William R. tries to bring to his Model 1 decision-making. But it was not to be. As we already know, voters with William’s capacity for rational decision-making do not really exist, but voters like Bethany do. She found that politics is about feeling, even as she tried to make it about thinking. Her existing feeling about the candidates and the parties interacted with what she was learning to bias her decision-making. She just could not—nor can any of us—separate her feelings from what she was learning. Trump and Clinton—and their campaigns—seemed to play to and with her emotions. The 2016 campaign was made emotionally visceral (as noted above) in ways unexpected by Bethany. She felt like not only did she have to vote, but she even had to do more. Her anxiety motivated her to pay attention, while her anger at Trump and the enthusiasm she ultimately developed for Clinton made her not only go out and vote but to also try to convince others.

From the beginning, though, Bethany felt like Clinton was a better choice than Trump. Much of this was due to her preexisting feelings about Trump that came from having learned about his unglamorous side over many years. She had lived a portion of her life in New Jersey, and therefore, had more exposure to information about Trump’s history in real estate. Some of her friends told stories about how Trump, in their words, “ripped off” the many contractors that he had hired.[^14] As New Jerseyans, they held a particularly dim view of Trump, whom they blamed for the shrinking of Atlantic City. Bethany valued her friends’ perspectives and respected their resentment toward Trump. This experience turned into a personal predisposition to feeling disgusted by Trump. In essence, her **hot cognition** (Chapter 6]]) about Trump was negative and had the effect of making it hard for her to be even handed in her assessment, no matter how much she might have wanted to. She was motivated to see bad things about Trump while generally expecting to learn good things about Clinton.

And so, Bethany was also tapping into preexisting evaluations which were then reinforced by an information search that sought out the good for Clinton and the bad for Trump. Some of this evaluation naturally overlaps with partisanship and Model 2 voting: She was raised by parents who were long-standing and loyal members of the Democratic Party. But Bethany felt like she knew who the better candidate was even _before_ considering the parties they represented and the platforms on which they were running, and her information search was designed to support her existing preferences.

Bethany felt more than simply good about Clinton and bad about Trump. Indeed, she found a whole range of emotions engaged by the campaign, including her worry about what would happen if Trump won, with ever-increasing anxiety as Clinton focused on Trump’s clear violations of typical norms. Clinton and outsider supporting groups’ campaign ads played strategically selected portions of Trump’s remarks about women and underrepresented minority groups.[^15] Bethany couldn’t help but feel a bit disgusted. In fact, viewing the _resources/books//A Citizen's Guide to the Political Psychol - David P. Redlawsk of young children watching Trump began to spark fits of anxiety, in which her identity as a woman seemed to be under threat.

Interestingly, though, the more Trump made her anxious, the more she focused on learning about what might happen if Trump were elected president. Would his administration be so uncaring that the economy would worsen and her job would be at stake? Would women’s rights be curtailed? The critical rhetoric surrounding Trump that described him as a madman who wanted to deconstruct the administrative state,[^16] who would purposefully stir chaos in the foreign policy arena, and his mysteriousness in regard to a bevy of issues, made her even more anxious.

Her increasing attention to the campaign led Bethany to seek out more confirmatory information that Clinton was indeed the right choice. She spent a great deal of time on her “Politics” Twitter list learning about all the bad things about Trump while discounting negative information about Clinton in order to confirm to herself what she now believed. She tuned into Trump’s rallies on CNN, listening to him speak live until he said enough things she considered bad to further confirm her thoughts about him. She read any opinion piece she could get her hands on that criticized Trump for the way his campaign was run. Bethany’s preexisting evaluations about each candidate affected the way she acquired and processed new information about the candidates, essentially biasing her processing.

At times, Bethany found herself angered by what Trump represented for the future of the country and what he had done in the past. The anger about Trump and the developing enthusiasm for Clinton led her to seek out Clinton’s local campaign office in downtown Austin, TX, where Bethany then lived, to pick up a few voter canvassing routes in the affluent suburb of The Hills.

In 2016, the saturated information environment made it even more attractive to trust her gut and vote with her emotions. With so much (talk of) “Fake News” and negative information about both candidates flying around, Bethany wanted to throw her hands up and trust that she would know what the best decision was to make at the polls in her gut, somewhat like a Model 4 voter, but with more information and more emotional commitment. Her positive emotional opinion of Clinton rendered any rationally calculated assessments that voting for Trump would be against her interests moot and made it difficult for her to objectively assess the information she gleaned from the news. Indeed, she found herself motivated to find all the evidence she could to support her choice to vote for Clinton, rather than to evenly consider the two options and choose the one that would maximize her expected utility.

## Emotions and Decision-Making

While the research, concepts, and theories presented here offer a challenge to the information processing models that we’ve described in this book, it does not mean that citizens like Bethany A. are doing it (voting) wrong. But it is simply wrong to assume that we can think without engaging our emotions.

There is an important debate in political psychology about the political consequences of this intertwining of cognition and emotion. On one side are George Marcus and his colleagues who support a **dual process model** which views emotion and cognition as the products of different, yet interactive, systems. Emotion is processed more quickly in the brain, and thus, we essentially can feel before we think.[^17] In their groundbreaking book, _Affective Intelligence and Political Judgement_, Marcus and his colleagues focus on the two sides of the emotional coin. One is the **dispositional** subsystem, which, in essence, keeps us moving forward. Enthusiasm is the defining emotion for this subsystem; to the extent that voters are enthusiastic about a candidate, they will turn out to vote, probably applying existing knowledge and preferences without extensive effort to learn more. They call the other subsystem the **surveillance** system. Its job is to scan the environment for risks and unexpected challenges. When triggered, anxiety is the defining emotion, and we become motivated to learn more to address the problem and protect ourselves. More recently, anger has been included in this model, as an emotion that, while negative, drives us to try to respond to what causes the anger.[^18]

On the other side are Milton Lodge and Charles Taber, who argue that people automatically “tag” concepts with positive and negative emotion as we learn new information.[^19] As introduced in Chapter 3]], this computational model integrates the notion of **hot cognition** with long-term memory. People employ a tally system, sorting information they encounter in their lives into positive and negative boxes. These feelings are stored in long-term memory, which people will be able to recall even when they inevitably forget the specific details or reasons for feeling a particular way. The idea is that voters spontaneously generate an overall impression—a summary evaluation—of one or more candidates over the course of a campaign that enables them to make a decision in the voting booth.

According to this model, when a prospective voter learns something bad about a candidate he or she likes, it will _not_ necessarily motivate him or her to gather more information. For example, if you liked Hillary Clinton as a candidate in 2016, hearing that she had given paid speeches at Goldman Sachs in New York made you feel bad about her candidacy. You put that information in the negative box, but then (unconsciously) decide that you do not want to feel that way again, so you simply stop seeking out information about Clinton. Conversely, if you heard Donald Trump say he wanted to raise taxes on the wealthy, you put that in the positive box but, for fear of changing your mind, you resist seeking out other positive information about Trump.

This **online processing model** brings bias into the discussion. We said above that emotions may bias the functioning of our cognitive processes. But, according to the online processing model, bias comes into the picture when people are asked to specify what information they used to justify their voting decision. In other words, they are not able to recall the particular reasons why they favored one candidate over another, and will instead seek the nearest, most accessible reasons when put on the spot.[^20] While an influential model that underlies the concept of motivated reasoning—which seems to be used to explain nearly everything in partisan politics—Lodge and Taber’s approach to emotion is limited to valence and does not really address the many different ways we can feel about politics. For that we turn to **Affective Intelligence**.

## Affective Intelligence: Some Emotions Make You Smarter—Others May Not

Affective Intelligence addresses the question of whether particular emotions have distinct effects under specific conditions. One might say that this avenue of research seeks to revise the rational model of voting behavior by precisely determining the instances in which people will vote according to their usual (habitual) partisan preference and when they will engage in a search for more information to confirm or deny the anxiety, or another emotion, they have about the candidate they would typically prefer.

In developing affective intelligence theory, George Marcus, Russ Newman, and Michael MacKuen,[^21] focus on three specific groups of emotions that appear to have an effect on voting behavior: enthusiasm, anxiety, and anger. Enthusiasm is defined as a set of positive emotions that motivate voters to actually take the time to go and vote for a candidate. Anxiety is a discrete negative emotion that alters information processing. It motivates voters to pay more attention to the campaign than they otherwise would. Anxious voters learn relatively more about the candidates and the political environment than non-anxious voters; this is not to say they learn _more accurate_ information, however. Anger is a specific emotion that generates defensiveness. Angry voters are unwilling to reconsider their prior beliefs, but they are often willing to act to resolve their anger.

Surveys showed that some Trump voters were a particularly angry group, either because of their frustration with their own lives, with government, or even because of Trump himself. They also coupled their doubts about Clinton with anger, and they got angry when news media questioned the degree to which Trump really was a businessman competent enough to occupy the office of president and drain the swamp. The prior belief that the country needed a change from the Obama era held sway.

The ways in which enthusiastic and angry voters think and behave is quite straightforward. But let’s more closely consider the full spectrum of anxiety and its potential effects. As we’ve noted in previous chapters, partisanship is consistently the most reliable predictor of a voting decision. So how does emotion interact with and condition partisanship? First, research shows that when voters become more anxious about a candidate from their own party, they tend to seek out more information to confirm and deny the validity of this anxiety.[^22] Second, when people feel at ease, they will follow their positive emotions and vote their partisan preferences without much thought. Model 2 voters may look like this, at least as long as their information search doesn’t challenge them, and it likely won’t. Moreover, they will be _happy_ that the decision did not require much effort. Third, when voters feel uneasy due to a mismatch between expectations (about a candidate) and the reality (of the candidate), they seek out and pay more attention to whatever is causing the anxiety. This causes them to be more analytical in their thinking, meaning that, at the very least, they will seek out more information.

Perhaps unexpectedly, anxious voters look more like rational voters than voters experiencing different emotions.[^23] Thus, affective intelligence theory argues that people are likely to make better (i.e., more rationally rewarding) decisions when they are anxious or afraid. They will do so because they will seek out more information, especially about candidates and campaigns themselves, in the present context, as one strategy to alleviate anxiety and fear. The more they know about something that makes them anxious, the more confident they will be in making the right decision to deal with it—whatever _it_ is.

Experiencing anxiety—a negative emotion—about the candidate from one’s preferred party causes a prospective voter to proceed more carefully and ground judgments on more relevant and useful information for the task at hand. Anxious voters are therefore more likely to defect from their usually preferred party. This is especially true, if, upon further inspection, the candidate _not only_ causes anxiety, but they _also_ hold issue positions different from the voter’s.[^24]

Let’s get a little more concrete with an example. Maybe you (or someone you know) went through quite the arduous process when it came time to find someone to accompany you to the homecoming dance at your high school. This is a decision where you might have been afraid of making the wrong choice; the thought of being rejected weighed heavily on you. And thus, you were probably anxious. What did you do? You did your research! You asked your friends about the one you had your eye on, you asked his or her friends, you took mental notes about your own interactions with this person and their interactions with others. Perhaps, after a time, you realized your initial choice was the wrong choice. So, you start to think about asking someone else because it increases your probability for success. The purpose of all this research was to reduce your anxiety just enough so that you felt comfortable enough to take action.

What if you are extremely confident that your preferred date would accept your invitation? What if your preferred (dance) candidate was a really bad choice, and your overconfidence in him or her had given you blinders? Political psychologists Howard Lavine, Chris Johnston, and Marco Steenbergen argue that voters are reliant upon partisanship; it serves as a heuristic for making political decisions. But what happens when emotions get involved? If a candidate or party evokes negative emotions for a voter, she may become more ambivalent—that is, have mixed feelings—and move to a decision-making process that takes more effort. The effect that emotion has on political judgments is dependent upon whether the emotions violate expectations or confirm expectations. When emotions violate expectations, the partisan voter is more likely to make an effort to learn more about the candidates and the campaign.

This means that anxious ambivalent partisan voters are more objective and less biased when voting. They are more likely to know more facts about politics and give more attention to economic issues vis-à-vis cultural or social issues. Indeed, David Redlawsk and colleagues found evidence for a tipping point in a 2010 research paper. Voters may receive so much negative information about their preferred politicians that they go from rationalizing to becoming more ambivalent or anxious and therefore, becoming _better_ voters.[^25] Higher levels of information reduce the effect or occurrence of motivated reasoning (and motivated information search).

But anxiety’s effect on the decision-making process doesn’t always result in more rational voters. To extend the homecoming dance metaphor, you might have found yourself in the (all-too familiar) situation where the more information you gathered about your potential date, the more you felt threatened by others who were thinking of doing the same thing you were. This could lead you down a path toward a lose-lose situation where you lose focus of the task at hand, fail to see the information that actually matters, and ask the wrong person and experience rejection, or even manipulation, at the hands of cynically minded others.

Bethany Albertson and Shana Gadarian, in their book _Anxious Politics_, also view anxiety as a catalyst for people to seek out information. However, they argue that anxiety makes people focus on threats—especially to their identity and social standing/status—and the information they seek will not be unbiased. When it comes to voting, anxious voters are potentially open to manipulation by candidates, campaigns, media outlets, vocal friends, etc. In other words, anxious voters do not magically transform into better voters. Rather, they may be at risk of cynical manipulation by political campaigns employing a two-part strategy to induce anxiety and then focus on threat in order to attract votes.[^26]

What kind of threat decisively alters information search and processing? Social scientists like to call these _ontological_ threats. That is, there is something “out there”—an external threat—that seeks to end their current (real or imagined) way of life. We discussed this concept before when we addressed the role of identity in voting in Chapter 6]]. But here we are combining the threat with anxiety.

While affective intelligence suggests anxious voters will learn more, the twist is that citizens focus specifically on threatening information, which induces them to seek out threatening news. Thus, Albertson and Gadarian caution us that we cannot assume that the information that anxious people go out and find is necessarily true or helpful. They found that voters anxious about immigrants, who were then exposed to threatening stories about immigration, were more likely to increase their consumption of information about the topic. But people experiencing anxiety seem more likely to look for and retain threatening information in an attempt to make sense of what is going on. In their words, “anxiety biases the type of information that people prefer.” The normative implication is that politicians could (and do) take advantage of anxious people and threatening information to implement and justify increasingly extreme policies.[^27]

So, if you’re an anxious citizen, what can you do to get yourself out of this spiral of anxiety and threat? Are you stuck fearing Republicans, liberal fascists, illegal immigrants, or climate change, forever? Well, affective intelligence theory does see a way out of the anxiety trap. Anxious people may become so anxious that they are motivated to take action—including voting!—to alleviate the anxiety, rather than just continuing to learn. Anger may play a role in moving people to action. Once anger takes over, the search for more (potentially anxiety-producing) information is cut short.[^28] Research suggests that anger motivates people to go out and vote, more so than anxiety or enthusiasm.[^29]

Model 2 identity voters may be especially likely to act if they are thinking about identity while experiencing anger. Identity seems to matter, especially when voters are engaged in emotional politics. In surveys, voters who report that they voted the way they did because they were “angry” or because they were “enthusiastic” are more likely to strongly identify with particular social groups. The threat of losing an election—effectively losing power—tends to make identity-oriented voters _angry_, which in turns leads to action. On the other hand, the assurance that one’s party will win an election generates _enthusiasm_, which also leads to action. In this case, action can simply mean voting.

If threats and reassurances converge, taking action is even more likely. Thus, in the 2016 election, white working-class Republican-leaning voters may have felt threatened not only with an electoral loss, but also with a status loss. For example, there was a fear that conservatives would be defeated in apocalyptic fashion with the election of Hillary Clinton, decreasing their social standing relative to women and underrepresented minority groups. On the other hand, Trump’s use of symbolic grievances also caused Democratic-aligned groups to become angry, in turn exacerbating the gap between the Electoral College and popular vote percentages.

Emotions, of course, were not unique to 2016. In 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s anti-immigrant rhetoric during the primary contests generated anger among many Latino voters, increasing their political engagement and their enthusiasm for Democrats.[^30] Ahead of the 2008 presidential election, upwards of 30 percent of white Americans were worried about Barack Obama as the first black president, although other voters were enthusiastic.[^31] Voters can view losing elections as a threat to their social identity, and, in turn, feel hostility toward the opposing party.[^32] Such negative partisanship is similar to the parochialism associated with rooting for a preferred sports team. Fans not only root for their team to win, but for the demise of the other team. This way of thinking makes it more acceptable, especially from an emotional standpoint, to vote for a less than ideal candidate.

## Conclusion

What we attempted to do in this chapter is to emphasize the importance of emotions in conditioning the cognitive processes of voting. While we were not able to give justice to all the emerging political psychology research that takes emotions seriously, we highlighted some of the most visible strands, especially in the context of the 2016 election. That said, with all this literature and experimental evidence in mind, it seems clear that emotions matter when it comes to affecting cognitive processes. As Rose McDermott concludes, “[p]olitical science, too, can benefit from these discoveries by recognizing that rationality depends on feelings as much as on cognition.”[^33] Those interested in developing, for example, an emotional _model_ of voting behavior probably need to push further on the question, how do we go beyond saying, quite simply, that emotions matter—not only for existing models—but on their own?

One way forward is to start all research into voting behavior with the premise that emotions are a necessary part of decision-making—in voting and everyday life. Psychologist Antonio Damasio has prominently taken this position, arguing that emotion is foundational to decision-making. To make a decision, you likely have to be emotionally invested in doing so.[^34] In other words, you can’t make a choice without being emotionally engaged. This is as true for Donald Trump deciding which steak to order as it is for someone making a decision on who to vote for. But they also may be necessary for someone to make _any_ decision.

Additionally, psychologists agree that emotion is processed through a parallel independent system—one that works much _faster_ than the cognitive system. The jury is still out on the degree to which these systems are distinct when it comes to real-world political decision-making. But the fact that emotional processing is “fast” is why we like to call it “thinking with your gut” rather than “thinking with your head.” In this way, emotional thinking precedes any form of rational thinking and sets the stage for other cognitive processes. Cognitive and emotional responses to information emanating from a political campaign, of 2016 and beyond, condition the decision-making processes.[^35]

# 9So, What Do Voters Do?]]

What do voters do? This question has driven research in political science for many decades, and the answers become more and more complicated as we delve further into the details of what happens inside voters’ heads. In some respects, the answer to what voters do has to be a simple one: “It depends.” There really are no general covering laws that explain voter behavior. Instead, as these decades of research have shown, voters respond to an information environment created by the political campaigns and the media before, after, and during elections. How they respond is determined by a number of factors, including the type and amount of information available, the complexity of the choice (the task demands), and the ways in which voters process the information that they do encounter. Voters encounter (or search for) information that they evaluate in conjunction with their existing knowledge and interests, in order to make a choice. As political psychologists, we have been more interested in _how_ voters make their decisions, and how they interact with the information environment to do so.

Voters bring their own backgrounds and experiences, and their political sophistication (or lack thereof) to every voting decision. Candidates bring the campaign by preparing and delivering messages, while the media reports, analyzes, and provides opinions. The complexity of the campaign—its task demands—is defined by things like how many candidates are running, how distinct the candidates are from one another, and how much information they can provide (based on their resources). Some campaigns environments make it harder than others for voters to reach a decision. Primary elections, in general, are tough, because partisanship, the most important political cue in U.S. politics, does not differentiate the candidates. Elections with many candidates are harder than those with just two. And voters also have a tougher time voting correctly—that is, finding the candidate who best meets their expressed interests—when candidates take similar positions, or when one candidate can greatly outspend another one, and so, the information imbalance is large.

The “nature of the decision task” shaped by the information environment (Chapter 3]]), influences the ways in which voters can and do process the campaign. We’ve discussed the four models of voter information processing (first laid out by Lau and Redlawsk in _How Voters Decide_): the rational model (Model 1), the identity model (Model 2), the fast and frugal model (Model 3) and the intuitive model (Model 4). Each of these models is complex, and some have variants that may result in varied decisions. But these are models. By definition, models are simplifications of reality, designed to help us understand complex systems. Despite our personification of the models with our voters’ stories, in the real world, no voter follows the exact outlines of any one model, all of the time. The whole idea, here, is that the model a voter might appear to use to learn about choices will depend on the conditions of the information environment that may be different across elections, or even within them at different points in time. We use the models to help us understand the ways in which information is processed, given a particular information environment.

The ways in which people process information influence their evaluations and the choices they ultimately make, not to mention the quality of those choices. Voters have to balance two basic goals: to make a “good” decision and to make an “easy” decision. For many Americans, politics is not particularly visible to them during daily life; there are too many other challenges to pay careful attention to everything that politicians say and do. During election campaigns, voters’ awareness generally increases, at least for high-profile campaigns, such as those for president. Given the nature of the media environment, it is difficult for voters to not be exposed to at least some information from presidential campaigns. This is not true, of course, for many other elections. Often, there is little easily available information for local elections, and voters have to really pay attention and be motivated to learn much about their choices. With presidential elections, voters virtually have to go into hiding to avoid learning at least something.

In such an environment, then, voters must decide how much effort to put in. To what degree do they prefer to make an easy decision over ensuring the right choice? We put these in opposition to each other not because it is impossible to make a right choice that is easy, but because, from an information processing perspective, some approaches are harder but are more likely to result in a high-quality choice. Other approaches are easier but have a greater risk of picking the wrong candidate. Model 1 voters, for example, would presumably be fully informed about all of their choices, would accurately assess all information, and would have the highest likelihood of picking their utility-maximizing choice. But Model 1 voters may also be overwhelmed with information, perhaps to the point that it becomes too much to handle. Model 4 voters may find decision-making relatively easy, but can make very different choices depending on their decision rule and the order in which they encounter and process information. This suggests that the chances of an incorrect vote might be higher using this strategy. Model 3 voters may do well in difficult environments if they focus laser-like on the one or two things they care most about and make a choice based on those. But they may also fail by declining to consider many ways in which their chosen candidate does not maximize their expected utility. Being less informed than Model 1 voters, but aiming for the same outcome, it would seem they should fail often. As for Model 2, Identity voters are much less concerned with getting it right than they are with reinforcing their identity, no matter what.

Which model do voters actually use? The answer is, as ever, “it depends.” The complexity of the task demands of any election influence the strategies voters can use. In a relatively easy election with few candidates and limited information, voters may be able to be more like William R., and learn everything about everyone. But few elections are like this and voters who do so may actually make things difficult for themselves. As humans, we are “wired” to simplify decision tasks where we can and where the environment encourages us to do so. In high-profile campaigns, most voters cannot keep up with everything, so they turn to other approaches to make sense of their options. Model 2 seems especially compelling in an era of polarized politics where candidates are playing to our identities and our partisanship, making little effort to cross the aisle. Voters who then employ an identity strategy may find themselves satisfied psychologically, even as they vote for a candidate who does not actually have their best interests in mind.

Models 3 and 4 represent ways in which we often try to simplify an information environment while still wishing to do a good job, but do it more easily. These are adaptive strategies used to tame the information tide without giving up completely, and they seem to work quite often. Models 3 and 4 result in correct voting more often in both difficult primary elections and general elections than do either Models 1 or 2, although the partisan identity version of Model 2 can be a good approach in a partisan general election. Why do Models 3 and 4 work if they limit the information search to less than full information? Most often, the information environment is organized like it has been before: it is consistent, and consistency allows us to use shortcuts and simplify strategies effectively. However, when something is inconsistent—such as a candidate who goes against her party’s typical stands—then voters who fail to learn the details are less likely to vote correctly.

The idea of understanding what voters do takes us well beyond the questions of which issues matter, whether candidate personalities count, and the other usual suspects found in voting research. Instead, we seek to figure out what happens when voters encounter information about candidates and campaigns and how they process that information. Accordingly, in this book we went beyond the four basic models of information processing and delved into the exciting work on emotions and voting, which adds a new layer to our understanding. The cognitive approach to what voters do is important, and how information is gathered and processed matters, but without some understanding of the role emotions play, the cognitive models are lacking. It has become clear to researchers in recent years that voter decision-making operates both cognitively and emotionally. The two parts are intertwined. Emotional responses to candidates and campaigns can condition what we look for, how we understand it, and whether or not we accurately update our beliefs about candidates. Politicians have always known that politics is about emotion. Now, political psychologists are better understanding why.

As we write this final chapter, the 2020 presidential election contest is already well underway. While everything points to President Donald Trump being renominated by the GOP without much (if any) competition, the Democrats have a real primary battle on their hands. Where in the 2016 campaign there were 17 Republicans at the Iowa State Fair in August 2015, the Democrats had more than 20 in the summer of 2019. Democrats in 2020 faced the kind of complex information environment Republicans had four years before, and each Democratic voter had to come up with a way to make sense of the options in front of them.

Some likely tried to learn as much as possible about every option before settling on one, like William R., or Anne D. Others probably emphasized finding a candidate who comported with their own sense of identity, perhaps focusing on race or gender—the Democrats initially had lots of options along these lines. But in the primary, they could not use Warren M.’s partisan heuristic, since it only comes into play during a partisan general election. Alternatively, some Democrats may have narrowed things down to focus on only a few candidates, making Teresa C.’s fast and frugal decision. Or, given how complex this decision was for many, perhaps many Democrats searched for “good enough” like Herbert S. Maybe it didn’t matter if the candidate was perfect, as long as she or he was judged to be able to win. For Democrats in 2020, electability was key, and that may have meant focusing on gut feelings (and perhaps polling) to tell them who would be able to beat Trump.

We argued early in this book that while there were new twists and turns in the 2016 presidential election campaign, the information environment faced by voters was not dramatically different than that faced by voters in prior campaigns. While social media played a newly prominent—and not always beneficial—role, voters still faced an information environment that brought the same challenge they always face: how (and whether) to seek out information to make a good decision. In the era of the Internet, the tools may be different, and we may be able to access more information than ever imagined by previous generations in the wink of an eye, but voters still bring the same capacities and limitations to the task. We still have limited cognitive resources, we still need to simplify and use shortcuts, and we still probably cannot be the all-seeing calculator necessary to be a Model 1 utility-maximizing voter. Yet, it remains the case that most voters in American presidential elections manage to choose the candidate who best meets their expressed preferences. Whether or not we would normatively agree with those preferences, there is at least some good evidence that the strategies voters use, when matched to the information environment, let us do at least a “good enough” job most of the time. And sometimes good enough is simply good enough.
