## Nonduality will not fix your mental problems

> Do you think that the moment you realize you are Brahman, you will completely abide as this still love that we all long for?
> 
> It’s a good fantasy, and honestly, I fell for it too. My mental state was likely far worse than 99% of people, and when I finally came upon this realization, I almost ended up killing myself because I can hardly take it.
> 
> Hell, I still have weeks where the body is really activated and it’s hard for me to function, let alone live my life and get anything done in the real world.
> 
> The irony is, you will realize the totality of your suffering. And if you really suffered (ie: mental illness) you may even wish you never realized your true nature in the first place.
> 
> But that’s why I think it’s so important to get into therapy as soon as you can WITH a focus on nonduality. I don’t think typical therapy is of any value, but as long as the therapist is realized themselves, they can really do some magic.
> 
> Unfortunately people will say “but there is no person and there is nothing to do!!” But I’m speaking solely from my own experience, and several others who’ve come to realize that this understanding can come with some caveats.
> 
> Yes it’s beautiful and amazing and whatever. But the relative is still there even after awareness realizes itself. And my god, knowing the entirety of your suffering if there was a lot of suffering can take the wind out of you.
> 
> My advice? Get into therapy sooner. Stop listening to anyone that discounts emotional work and therapy. Yes, it hardly has anything to do with nonduality, but that fucked up mind will still be a fucked up mind, there just won’t be a person experiencing it anymore.
>  
> And for some medication may even be necessary. But leave that up to your therapist to decide. Take care of yourself, because it’s either now or never

	Agree to disagree.

	"Most people tell you that they want to get out of kindergarten, but don't believe them. Don't believe them! All they want you to do is to mend their broken toys. "Give me back my wife. Give me back my job. Give me back my money. Give me back my reputation, my success." This is what they want; they want their toys replaced. That's all. Even the best psychologist will tell you that, that people don't really want to be cured. What they want is relief; a cure is painful." - Anthony De Mello
