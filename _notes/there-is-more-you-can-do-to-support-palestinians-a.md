## there is more you can do to support Palestinians and stop the genocide

1. buy e-sims to help Gazans connect to internet. check @mirna_elhelbawi’s account for information and instructions. if you need support with the process, reach out to me and i can help you.
2. Anera (anera.org)is an org that is delivering food and hygiene kits right now in Gaza. They keep a log of their work so you can see where their donations go. 
3. Queer Mikveh Project @queermikvehproject is in direct contact with a mental health clinic in the West Bank that is also serving folks in Gaza right now. You can donate at paypal.me/queermikvehproject, with a note “for Palestine Mental Healthcare Clinic.” 
4. You can send free faxes to congresspeople at faxzero.com!  I sent art I made demanding a ceasefire to multiple offices of my congresspeople. To find fax numbers, google “[your rep. name] fax number” and it will come up with a list of their offices. Some have fax numbers and some don’t. Send to as many as possible! 
5. I offer these options assuming you are already reading, learning, sharing, having conversations, calling your congresspeople, boycotting Israeli goods, showing up to protests, and generally doing everything you can. Thank you for continuing to pay attention and speak up.
6. CEASEFIRE NOW

I know it is shabbat when I am posting this, I have been sick and wasn’t able to get this out earlier in the week. please bookmark and come back to take action as soon as you are able.
