The “slate” of incumbent top officers of the AFL-CIO running unopposed (unopposed! At this moment in history and the labor movement!) for re-election has a twitter account and the first person they followed is Joe Biden and I couldn’t have said it better myself



I have said this a million times and I know it feels niche or parochial but a core unavoidable task is a cross-union leadership challenge to the decades-long failed status quo. There’s an elegance to the Labor Notes Conference coming immediately after this sleepy coronation.

The most common response to this is: different leadership wouldn’t get different results — this is actually something I’m totally open to. The forces arrayed against the union movement are way bigger than whoever holds office.

But maybe \*the\* biggest lesson from Bernie is that, under the right conditions, a challenge to the status quo can cohere a movement that \*can\* change things. Building a \*base\* (not just finding a leader) that will fight for a new direction for the labor movement is the task.

so the million dollar question: where's that base, and where are those leaders, and how do you cohere them into an actual new direction for the labor movement?

are they the unions that strike, that organize? the radical teachers who fomented the massive RedForEd strike wave? the reformers challenging incumbents in the Teamsters & UAW? the local and national unions that endorsed Bernie, that are willing to challenge the Democrats?

I thought I heard Sara Nelson might challenge the incumbent president. That not happening?

"The election is in June, and when I asked Nelson recently about her plans she replied that the job is “not a position that I want.”"

Sen. McConnell is resigning. The most important fact about his tenure? "...his status as a peerless practitioner of the dark art of money-driven politics, which served as the indispensable foundation for his hold on the Senate machinery,"

Can't find the Twitter account. Can you point me to it?

obviously i agree with you but im also not sure how we get to a place where we can run a slate against leadership and win - alternative feels like losing and being blacklisted, and what does that help

Did you think about running?
