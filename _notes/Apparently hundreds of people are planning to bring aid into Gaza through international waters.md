## Apparently hundreds of people are planning to bring aid into Gaza through international waters, previous attempts have often ended in illegal murder and kidnapping of participants by IDF Navy forces. What are y'alls thoughts on the effectiveness and outcome?

	A party comrade and close friend is a ship captain that has sailed Ship to Gaza for the Freedom Flotilla seven times, and going this year as well.

	I'm always scared for him and all the others participating, even more so now, but at the same time I'm so impressed and in awe over their commitment and bravery. The first time he went, 10 people were killed by the IOF and many more wounded, one of them was shot to death by a helicopter sniper before the stormtroopers even set foot on the ship.

	After that luckily no one's been killed, but they've had all the goods seized (stolen), been assaulted and injured, and either deported or kidnapped and put in jail (luckily all released eventually). 

	The ships have never made it through the blockade, yet they never give up and keep on trying.

	Here's an article from our party paper back in august if anyone's interested:

	And here's another from the state media back in 2015:

	They're both in Swedish so you might need to use some translating tool if you don't speak it.

		Oh wow, thank you for the links and all the best to your comrade. Insanely brave to still go after witnessing the murder and mistreatment. Heroic actions
