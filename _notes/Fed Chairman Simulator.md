**Welcome to the Fed Chairman Simulator!**

You must last your 4 year term (1460 days, or 25 real life minutes) as Fed Chairman while maintaing the reputation of the Federal Reserve.

In order to achieve this it's critical you stick to your mandates as much as possible, which are to keep GDP above $40k per capita and CPI Inflation between 0-3%.

Every day these GDP & Inflation targets are met you gain reputation, and every day they are not met you lose reputation.

The two main levers you control are Interest Rates and Quantitative Easing/Tightening.

Gaining enough reputation will allow you to "spend" some of it by calling in favours from the Fed Board or politicans.

If your reputation falls low enough you will be removed from your position as Fed Chairman.

If you manage to make it to the end of your term you'll be added to the [Fed Chairman Hall of Fame.](https://fedchairsim.com/halloffame.php)
