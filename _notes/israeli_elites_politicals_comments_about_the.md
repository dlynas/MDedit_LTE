	Holy shit.

	These people should be tried for war crimes. Encouraging genocide

	Absolutely sickening. I don't think the English language has words strong enough to described this unhinged and deranged hatred.

	How does any rational human being celebrate children and babies being killed? 

	Those with the ability to stop this insanity need to act now. Enough with the hang-wringing and virtue signalling. Step up and enforce the International and Humanitarian Law you claim to represent. 

	History will not be kind to those who not only failed to stop this genocide, but enabled it.

		You sure about that? That part about how the future won’t be kind to them? Because, So far it has been, and they have had the world by the balls with every atrocious act by the victors of history. Maybe it’s time to acknowledge that humanity advances through evil as a measure of fitness because in this indifferent existence there is no God, and justice is a manipulated construct like every other thing you’ve ever been brought to believe in. 
		
		I’ve been screaming about this for decades and now that white fucks find it fashionable it’s getting attention in the 11th hour. People are even selfish and evil in how/when they care about things like this…..

			I try to remain hopeful. I believe the spotlight on the Israel-Palestine conflict is the brightest it's been. Thanks to social media awareness is spreading faster than ever. 
			
			TBH I think the establishment of Israel was fucked up from the start and things have only gone from bad to worse.

		Those who believe in absurdities are willing to commit atrocities. 
		
		Belief is a helluva drug.

	israelis: What the hell is wrong with Palestinians? Why dont they load themselves into boxcars like our ancestors did?

				Like I get why you're reacting like this, I didn't mean to derail the conversation I was just initially a little shocked, because I've found it to be important to remember
				
				sorry
				
				but yeah this genocide is obviously horrible and like i've grown up hearing "Never again" all the fucking time but apparently most people forgot what that means

	How representative is this?

	I see fascist, fundamentalist assholes, ruling their people with fear.

	They dance on the graves of Gazans and Israelis alike.

	This is so good. So effective, so real. 

	I've seen all those clips over the past months and some even years. But putting them back to back like that realy emphasizes how real all of this is. 

	How intentional it is.

	I hope there's an alternate universe where Jerusalem gets nuked for their country's behavior. Absolutely disgusting.
