As previously reported by Forbes, the U.S Navy is looking at ultra-short laser pulses [which create glowing plasma in mid-air](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2020/05/11/us-navy-laser-creates-plasma-ufos/?sh=ebdecee10746 "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2020/05/11/us-navy-laser-creates-plasma-ufos/?sh=ebdecee10746") to decoy missiles away from aircraft. This might explain some of the “UFOs” described in the recent Pentagon [report on Unexplained Aerial Phenomena.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2021/06/25/why-you-cant-always-believe-what-the-pentagon-says-about-ufos/?sh=222f568c1985 "https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2021/06/25/why-you-cant-always-believe-what-the-pentagon-says-about-ufos/?sh=222f568c1985") It turns out that interest in this technology goes back further than you might think — and not just in the U.S.

Back in 1966, commentators were trying to make sense of a previous report on UFOs, the Air Force’s [Project Blue Book](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/UFOsandUAPs/proj_b1.pdf?ver=2017-05-22-113513-837 "https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/FOID/Reading%20Room/UFOsandUAPs/proj_b1.pdf?ver=2017-05-22-113513-837"). Like the modern version, this concluded there was no evidence that UFOs were extraterrestrial craft, but was thin on explanation. Philip Klass, avionics editor at Aviation Week and notable UFO skeptic, wrote his analysis with the added perspective of a background in electrical effects. He concluded that some UFOs were “luminous plasmas of ionized air, a special form of ‘ball lightning’ generated by electric corona that occurs on high-tension power lines under certain conditions.”

[Ball lightning](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/ball-lightning "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/ball-lightning") can occur naturally during electrical storms or from shorts in high-voltage electrical gear, a little-understood cousin to the better-known [St Elmo’s Fire](https://www.livescience.com/st-elmos-fire.html "https://www.livescience.com/st-elmos-fire.html") which lights up masts and aerials before a storm. Klass, an expert on electronic warfare, clearly appreciated the potential to sow confusion among observers, although the technology to create such effects at will did not exist at the time. (Whether the mysterious Foo Fighters – [glowing balls of light seen by allied bomber crews](https://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/what-were-mysterious-foo-fighters-sighted-ww2-night-flyers-180959847/ "https://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/what-were-mysterious-foo-fighters-sighted-ww2-night-flyers-180959847/") in WWII – were a secret weapon, natural phenomenon or misreporting remains unknown).

Modern [ultrashort-pulse lasers](https://www.pulsar-photonics.de/en/about-us/ultra-short-pulse-laser-technology/ "https://www.pulsar-photonics.de/en/about-us/ultra-short-pulse-laser-technology/") provide a reliable means to create plasma remotely. Pulse duration is measured in femtoseconds – 10<sup>-15</sup> or millionths of billionths of a second. In 2005, two research scientists working for French defense giant THALES published a paper looking at the [missile defense potential](https://novel%20applications%20of%20femtosecond%20laser%20in%20missile%20countermeasures%20(spiedigitallibrary.org)/ "https://Novel%20applications%20of%20femtosecond%20laser%20in%20missile%20countermeasures%20(spiedigitallibrary.org)") of this effect, in particular for countering heat-seeking missiles . In addition to other possibilities they suggested “_plasma that can be used as active decoys against IR homing electronics,_” just like the U.S. Navy work from 2018.

THALES is a world leader in short-pulse lasers. NASA’s Curiosity Rover uses a THALES laser to [zap rocks into plasma](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/supercam/for-scientists/ "https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/supercam/for-scientists/") and analyze their chemical composition from the light they produce. But while they talk freely about scientific and commercial uses, the [THALES laser web page](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/market-specific-solutions/lasers "https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/market-specific-solutions/lasers") does not mention military applications. Perhaps the idea was not pursued; or they do not wish to discuss it.

A 2010 Chinese paper on [Femtosecond Laser Applications to EO-countermeasures](https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-GJDX201012004.htm "https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-GJDX201012004.htm") also discusses the potential for short-pulse lasers in confusing missile guidance, but there do not appear to be any other Chinese open-source papers on this topic. Again it may have been a crazy idea which went nowhere, or it may be that research is not carried on openly.

One of the most interesting stories in this field was the rumor which New Scientist journalist Justin Mullins heard about a bizarre new weapon supposedly being developed in the New Mexico desert back  in the 1980s. It was called the [Voice of God](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16422184-300-and-the-voice-said/ "https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16422184-300-and-the-voice-said/"):

“_Researchers working with high-power laser weapons discovered that they could create a glowing ball of fire in the sky by crossing the beams of two powerful infrared lasers. The beams were invisible to the naked eye, but where they intersected, their electric fields became so intense that they ripped apart_

_molecules in the air, creating a plasma…By moving the laser beams around the sky, the researchers found they could shift the plasma ball back and forth at very high speed_,” Mullins wrote in 2000.

So far so strange. What makes it stranger is that by pulsing the lasers they could modulate the crackling sound produced by the plasma to carry coherent speech: in effect, a talking fireball. The idea was that the device would be used for psychological operations, with a seemingly divine voice commanding opponents to flee or surrender.

Mullins never succeeded in finding out whether there was any truth behind the rumored experiments. Talking to various scientists he concluded that the Voice of God would be “possible in the lab but very difficult to produce in the sky.”

Taken on its own sounds like a crazy and unsubstantiated story. However, in 2018 the Pentagon’s Joint Non-lethal Weapons Program [released a video of short-pulse laser](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2018/03/us-military-making-lasers-create-voices-out-thin-air/146824/ "https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2018/03/us-military-making-lasers-create-voices-out-thin-air/146824/") creating an actual talking plasma fireball relaying barely-comprehensible speech – “[the creepiest thing you’ll hear all week](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/a19565020/pentagon-mimicking-human-speech-with-lasers/ "https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/a19565020/pentagon-mimicking-human-speech-with-lasers/")” according to Popular Mechanics. While this does not confirm that scientists were playing with laser fireballs in the sky in the 1980s, it suggests that the Voice of God project was not a complete fantasy.

Academic and commercial researchers have demonstrated [laser-plasma for 3D aerial displays](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8778-3d-plasma-shapes-created-in-thin-air/ "https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8778-3d-plasma-shapes-created-in-thin-air/"), but have not succeeded in maturing the technology enough for commercial use. (Video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNoOiXkXmYQ "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNoOiXkXmYQ") showing the state of the art in 2014).

Someday glowing plasma zipping overhead may be as unremarkable as a neon sign, and will probably advertise the same things on a grander scale. But for the mean time, this technology looks likely to give rise to reports of UFOs and those who know most are giving little away.
