	You hold your breath if you run out of air while scuba diving.

	Wrong, your lungs will explode as you'll float upwards with a lungful of air (and you probably will try to surface anyway) and the air inside them expands.

	The proper procedure is to scream all the way up to make sure your airways are open. AaaaaAaaaAaaaAAAaaaAAAA

	When I worked in spectator event safety, we learned (sport stadia) that when an evacuation is happening, the safest place to go to is the playing field. As it is usually open air and therefore low risk if it is a fire evacuation.

	However common sense takes over crowd dynamics and people try leaving the way they came in (from the other side of the building), so this common sense trait results in thousands of people flocking into burning buildings.

	An example of this was the Bradford City stadium fire, a huge chunk of the crowd headed back into the burning stadium looking for exits despite open air (the pitch) being metres in front of them.

		Sometimes, planning and training can count against you.   
		
		Look at the [Piper Alpha Disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Alpha) in the North Sea.    
		
		They were trained to muster in the fireproof accommodation block and await rescue.   
		
		The only people that survived broke training and jumped over the side.   
		
		Edit: Of course they were trained to go to lifeboat stations. The fallback option they were trained in if they couldn't get to lifeboat stations was to muster below the heli-deck and await rescue.

			Grenfell Tower Fire, UK. 
			
			“Any residents of the tower who called the fire service were told to remain in their flat unless it was affected, which is the standard policy for a fire in a high-rise building, as each flat should be fireproofed from its neighbours.” (wikipedia)
			
			Many survivors told how they ignored this advice. 
			
			72 people died from that fire. Who knows how many would have escaped had that advice not delayed them while the fire spread.

			My best friend is vegan. My best friend is also a big curvy woman. My best friend cannot roll her eyes hard enough when she hears people ignorantly proclaim that fat vegans don't exist because "vegan = healthy = thin." 
			
			I can give you a list of candy and junk food that's vegan. Vegan does not necessarily mean "healthy." Vegan just means there's no animal byproducts or ingredients used to make the food. 
			
			Edit: RIP, my inbox. I'm working on reading/replying. 
			
			Edit Pt2: There are lots of high calorie foods that happen to also be vegan friendly. It's a common misconception that vegans typically eat "clean" and lower calorie foods. Not true. The whole point of my comment is to point out that there is a lot of junk food that most people don't realize is also vegan. 
			
			As others have pointed out, there is a sort of Venn Diagram crossover between people who eat healthy diets and people who eat vegan, but the two do not have to intersect. My best friend happens to be vegan for the ethical reasons: she doesn't want to support the inhumane meat industry or animal testing/use of animal byproducts in beauty and body products.

Taco Bell can make vegan friendly burritos. 
					
					There's a bunch of not healthy food that just happens to be vegan.

	The harder you brush the cleaner your teeth get. All you're gonna do is cause gum recession.

	EDIT: I guess this is a good platform to share dental hygiene tips. Brush with a soft bristle brush for 2-3 minutes. Don't do side-to-side motion - make small circles on the surfaces of the teeth, flick away from the gum line with short strokes, and vibrate the toothbrush near the gumline at a 45 degree angle from the tooth. Electric toothbrushes are great - they're less technique sensitive and you just hold it over a tooth for 5-10 seconds without back and forth motion. Don't stick your toothbrush near your toilet for obvious (yet never thought about) reasons. &lt;-- To minimize poop ingestion, stick it in a drawer or get a cover for your brush.

					My teeth basically just don’t have protection from anything. I get a lot of cavities (have had multiple silver teeth since a young age) and my teeth are also incredibly sensitive to hot and cold things.

							It's called enamel strengthening b/c it has a lot of the necessary minerals and stuff to support healthy enamel, and can give enamel like benefits to those without. It strengthens the teeth and helps build a protective layer, sort of like a stalactite or stalagmite forming in a cave, slow build up of minerals in the toothpaste.

	Running hot water to pour grease down the sink drain. That water always cools eventually, and usually the same distance down the drain, where it solidifies, creating a blockage. Although IT’S BEST TO NEVER PUT GREASE DOWN THE DRAIN, if you run cold water, and run the garbage disposal, the grease will solidify when it hits the cold water, the disposal will chop it into tiny pieces, and it will float down the line, creating no blockage. 

	Edit: Highlighted an important part and thanks for the gold!

		Municipal water and sewer worker of 15 years here.  Pouring grease down the drain is never a good thing, for your pipes or the system.  Grease passes through the body the same way it goes in, relatively speaking.  As a young man, working fast food, loading up the fryers with fresh oil after cleaning and changing, it starts as a huge 50lb, white block of oil.
		
		As a sewer worker, one of the main system problems is grease buildup, in customer laterals and system mains.  It clings to the walls, a sticky white, globular substance, that is difficult to remove.  Over time it solidifies into a rock like substance, similar to the hardness of weak shale stone.  Many times high pressure water is not enough to remove it, and the application of chemicals that create a thermal reaction are needed to dissolve it and move it down to the lift station where it can be vacuumed out.
		
		Pouring grease with soap or detergent, with hot water, while running a garbage disposal, does nothing for the grease.  Any action it has, the grease will reform.  Hot water liquifies the grease, soap does break it up, but dissipates.  And breaking it into smaller pieces, it only congeals and clumps back together.
		
		Garbage disposals in general are horrible devices and, in my experience, are a leading problem, second to tree roots, as a cause of blockages.  They give the impression that as long as you can emacerate anything, it can be flushed down a drain.  If you think you need to add hit water, detergent, or run the garbage disposal, to flush something down the drain, you shouldn't put it down the drain.
		
		If it does make it past your pipes, it's only going to jam up somewhere else down the line.  While I'm not sure, there are better ways to dispose of grease than rinsing it down your pipes.

		I was told a story by my forensics teacher a few years ago. It’s been some time since I’ve heard it so some details are fuzzy.
		
		My forensics teacher was going out with friends one day. After a day at the mall, their car was only one of a few in the parking lot. It was late(ish) at night, so they all hurried to the car. As they were about to drive away, a drunk guy came up to the car and pulled a gun on them. Keep in mind that they all saw the dude’s face. They got away fine, and reported the incident to the police.
		
		When asked to describe the perpetrator, all three of them gave a different description, despite the fact that they all saw the same guy, at the same time, from relatively the same angle. 
		Human brains are weird.

					I'd like to encourage everyone to look at the story of Ronald Cotton [(60 Minutes Piece)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2oDRfj0vME). He was convicted for rape on eyewitness testimony combined with a bad alibi, and later exonerated with DNA evidence after serving 10.5 years in prison. The victim claimed to have focused all of her energy during her attack on remembering the details of her attacker's face, yet still picked the wrong person in a lineup. 
					
					The state of North Carolina only compensated Mr. Cotton $110,000 for his wrongful 10.5 year incarceration. These days, both he and the victim have become friends and outspoken advocates for eyewitness testimony reform.

		I once ran across the street to help a woman who was lying on the ground.  She got up and ran away after being assaulted and a few minutes later police showed up and I told them which way she went.  They asked me for a description.  
		
		A few minutes later I passed her again while walking up the block.  The only thing I got right was her hair colour and that she was wearing a dark shade.  I thought she was wearing a winter jacket but she really just had a hoodie on - thought she was wearing jeans and winter boots but it was black leggings and sneakers.  I was kneeling beside her and had my hand on her back before she ran off and I still couldn't accurately tell what she was wearing.

	A lot of nutrition "common sense" is based on nothing, and/or has never been proven. I chalk it up to the fact that the human body is more adaptable than anyone gives it credit for, and that goes for diet as well as a lot of other things. That, and people think they can find solutions through dietary inclusions/exclusions, or they look toward those things as something to blame health problems on.

		It also doesn’t help that literally anyone can call themselves a ‘nutritionist’ and write articles about nutrition. The average person sees that and thinks it implies credibility. But that would be a registered dietitian.  Instead there are tons of ‘nutritionists’ out there spewing their own anecdotal experiences or personal beliefs as fact. When in reality, as you sort of alluded to, everyone’s body is different and beyond the incredibly obvious things, there are very few nutritional practices that will suit everyone best.

	When you see an emergency vehicle with sirens on behind you, you should always slow down and move to the lane or shoulder to your right.

	 This is exactly what you should do on city roads, but on the highway, you should never brake for an emergency vehicle unless they're pulling you over or you're slowing for a stopped vehicle. Braking in front of an ambulance just slows them down and creates traffic jams. Maintain your speed and get your signal on and merge as soon as you can. And for God's sakes, stop slamming on your brakes to avoid a speeding ticket when you see a cop. Just take your lead foot off the gas and slow naturally. Driving with y'all is scary.

	"if youre in a relationship but develop feelings for someone else, break up with them because if you truly loved them, you wouldn't love the second person"

	Bull shit. Don't cheat, don't have an emotional affair, but figure out what's going on in your heart and your head before throwing away a loving relationship over a crush. One size does not fit all

	Editing to include some good points of clarification made by other peeps: the point of this post is to say that before you started dating your SO, you had a crush on them. You didn't know where it was going, but you started dating to find out, and it turned into a relationship. Interest is not the same as a relationship. But it's totally possible to have interest in people even when you're in a relationship, and it doesn't mean you should 100% end the relationship when this happens, because it could mean literally nothing. That's for you to decide.

	Also talking to your partner is important. That's what I did when it became too confusing, and I wish I'd talked to them sooner. Theyre human too (right? Or aliens, I don't know you) and even if they haven't experienced it, they should understand it.

	Yes, it sucks to be the SO in this situation, but it would suck more if you insisted your girlfriend of 2 years leave you because she thinks the new guy at work is cute.

	What you do about your feelings is vastly more important than your feelings themselves.

	Also, just so I stop getting this comment: polyamorous relationships are a thing.

It feels like a betrayal to her, and like it isn’t fair to whoever comes next, idk, the few people I have said this to dismissively say “it’s not time for thinking that” or “you know she would want you to be happy” or something similar... sorry to just drop that on you

				All I can really say is that if you never meet someone again that's also fine, you don't have to go out and find someone else if you don't want one just because other people tell you, and if you do find someone, maybe that's fine too. Ask yourself if the roles were reversed and she found someone that made her feel how you feel would you be okay with where things are going.

	>It is rarely necessary to wait 24 hours before filing a missing person report. 

	-

	>Despite being referenced commonly in culture[184][185] and society at large,[186][187][188] the idea that Victorian Era doctors invented the vibrator to cure female 'hysteria' via triggering orgasm is a product of a single work[189] rejected by most historians.[184][188][190]

	>When a meteor or spacecraft enters the atmosphere, the heat of entry is not (primarily) caused by friction, but by adiabatic compression of air in front of the object.

	-

	>There is no such thing as an "alpha" in a wolf pack. An early study that coined the term "alpha wolf" had only observed unrelated adult wolves living in captivity. In the wild, wolf packs operate more like human families: there is no defined sense of rank, parents are in charge until the young grow up and start their own families, younger wolves do not overthrow an "alpha" to become the new leader, and social dominance fights are situational.

	-

	>Drowning is often inconspicuous to onlookers.[322] In most cases, raising the arms and vocalising are impossible due to the instinctive drowning response.[322] 

	-

	>Exercise-induced muscle soreness is not caused by lactic acid buildup.

	-

	>Water-induced wrinkles are not caused by the skin absorbing water and swelling.[340] They are caused by the autonomic nervous system, which triggers localized vasoconstriction in response to wet skin, yielding a wrinkled appearance.[341][342] 

	-

	>~~Alcohol does not necessarily kill brain cells.[361] Alcohol can, however, lead indirectly to the death of brain cells in two ways: (1) In chronic, heavy alcohol users whose brains have adapted to the effects of alcohol, abrupt cessation following heavy use can cause excitotoxicity leading to cellular death in multiple areas of the brain.[362] (2) In alcoholics who get most of their daily calories from alcohol, a deficiency of thiamine can produce Korsakoff's syndrome, which is associated with serious brain damage.[363]~~ Edit: I'm striking this out for now. It's true that the notion that "every time you have a beer you lose brain cells" is false. However, the two ways they listed are not exhaustive, and chronic alcoholism does lead to nerve cell loss and I'm worried people may interpret this comment as thinking that chronic alcohol consumption is fine for your brain.

	-

	>Pregnancies from sex between first cousins do not carry a serious risk of birth defects:[380] The risk is 5–6%, similar to that of a 40-year-old woman,[380][381] compared with a baseline risk of 3–4%.[381] The effects of inbreeding depression, while still relatively small compared to other factors (and thus difficult to control for in a scientific experiment), become more noticeable if isolated and maintained for several generations.[382][383]

		The drowning one is a very important one. I once almost drowned in a pool when I was like 5 or so. I made a step from the shallow end to the deep end, and suddenly it was too difficult for me to keep my head above water. You know when I realised when I was drowning? When I was 19 or something like that, the first time I actually read a drowning description warning you of the signs, and I was like, wait a minute.
		
		&amp;#x200B;
		
		And it isn't like I wasn't conscious or too young, I can remember that moment clearly, and I remember my thought process as well. I never felt like I was drowning, I felt like I screwed up, and I just needed to make a step back to the shallow end. Either by moving my feet to the floor, or grabbing the floating line that separates the shallow and deep end of the pool and pulling myself back. At the same time I didn't float. My head kept bouncing underwater, so, more frantic movement to keep my head above water. But, I did manage that, so, I wasn't drowning, I was keeping my head out of the water usually. But, I didn't have enough movement to do something about moving back to the shallow end without losing momentum and keeping my head above water. I could do one, or the other, but not both. But I wasn't drowning, I was still just busy unscrewing my fuck up.
		
		&amp;#x200B;
		
		So, yeah, I can definitely understand those weird and ironic stories of how a pool celebrates a year of no drownings, and someone then drowns at that party filled with life savers. If you drown you are not busy making big movements to warn others of your peril. Most likely you don't even think you are drowning, and you need all your strength and momentum to keep your head above the water, which are small and irregular movements. If the head is bobbing, that is a bad sign.

				Jesus. I knew already that drowning doesn't look like what a lot of people think it does, but in the first video that came up the child drowning was SURROUNDED by people within arm's reach, including adults and people with floaties, looking right at him. One woman wouldn't even move her floaty out of the lifeguard's way.
				
				I had a near-drowning experience in the ocean when I was a teen, but I was so far away from everyone that I couldn't expect someone to just save me (thankfully an off-duty ocean lifeguard saw me, and rescued me). The thought of a child drowning inches away from multiple people who could easily just lift his head out of the water... horrible.

				Mom jumped in and saved me. This is actually really important I didn't mention, but despite being literal centimetres or even millimetres away from safety, an outside source had to save me from drowning. I am not even sure if you can even save yourself when you are drowning without outside help. Keep an eye out when the pools or beaches are busy, you can very realistically save lives. I was in a relatively crowded pool, but nothing absurd and there was definitely room and space, and I think there should have been life guards present, but it was my mom when she returned to the pool who jumped in and saved me. Of course, she would have more reason to look out for me specifically compared to some random stranger, but still.

					I was a BSA and ARC certified lifeguard as a teenager.  One of the things they teach you is to never expect someone to call for help.  The first sign of a potential drowning victim was wild splashing, the second was seeing a head bob under water twice.  If one or both of those things happened, go immediately.  If it's someone playing, it's better that you were on your way to helping than being behind the ball if it's a real emergency.
					
					They also teach us methods to distance ourselves from drowning victims.  A lot of people won't be able to hear you and will grab you and push you down to push themselves up.  It's better to have 1 drowning victim go unconscious while you're very near than to have 2 drowning victims because the first made you one too.

		As for the cousins thing, it's important to note that the relatively low risk of birth defects applies to the first pair of cousins to have a child. If it's a commonplace practice and a family has generations of cousin marriages you do start building up the odds of more serious birth defects. It takes a while for things to get really inbred and bad but it will happen eventually if a particular family group has frequent cousin marriage.

We always say no to those people, and usually save the coupons for those who are here out of inconvenience eg. exchanging a defective item, waiting for their computer to be repaired, but also if they didn’t ask for it. I tend to find that the coupon/freebie is appreciated much more by those who weren’t expecting it.

	They're not, the caffeine gets cooked out the longer you roast the coffee bean. The lighter the roast, the higher the caffeine content.

	Astronomer here! In honor of the equinox today, the seasons are *not* caused because of our distance from the sun. (In fact we are slightly closer to the sun during northern hemisphere winter over summer!) Instead it is caused by the fact that the Earth is tilted on its axis, and we get more direct sunlight in summer over winter (aka like how the sun sets earlier in winter over summer). 

	There is actually a depressing video where some reporters [went to graduation at Harvard and asked people what caused seasons. ](https://youtu.be/p0wk4qG2mIg) Most people didn’t know, citing the “closer to the sun” thing

	Edit: for those who are saying “people believe this?!” there are multiple people in the replies saying their teachers and textbooks in school stated the “closer to the sun” thing for the seasons. Many people do in fact believe the falsehood, and that’s why this is a huge example of issues in science literacy our society faces.
