[#HoldUp](https://x.com/hashtag/HoldUp?src=hashtag_click) This past week when I read about the fact that hundreds of bodies were found executed on the hospital grounds in Gaza I was deeply disturbed. But then, when I read that many of the bodies were of children with their hands cuffed behind their backs and many of the dead were hospital staff still in their scrubs and many of the dead had been patients in the hospital who still had IV tubes attached to them, I felt like I was reading a horror story. But it got worse. When I read that many of the victims of the bloodthirsty IOF were buried alive, I finally realized I’d heard the worst thing ever. And the most disturbing part is it’s really not on our media in America and our president is not speaking out against these atrocities which are extreme. They cannot be more extreme!! What does this mean? I guess Biden is OK with burying people alive, murdering children with handcuffs behind their backs, murdering medical staff and murdering hospital patients still attached to their IVs. What kind of madness is this? How are we all getting up today and going into work like it’s another Monday?



Ready to remove the resist hashtag now? Join those of us who fully realize our government is corrupted beyond repair & both parties are fully complicit.

Oh, indeed I am right now. Thank you for reminding me!!

No, sorry to tell you, but it’s the truth — just ask the survivors who lost family in this despicable way.

There has been very little coverage if this on the BBC. Had anything remotely like this happened in Ukraine, you can bet that there would have been wall to wall coverage. Why is this?

Racism. Brown people aren’t thought of as like “typical” Americans - which is complete BS.

You carry on. The most important thing is that you don’t let truth get in the way of a good story

You carry on as you have for 75+ years with the lying in order to steal peoples homes and lands and livelihood and lives out from under them. You carry on.

Are you sure you're not getting played?

Are you sure you know who you are talking to? I don’t get played buddy. I’ve been in this game way longer than you have and you can take your mansplaining and keep it to yourself.

it’s total madness. Sadly I’m no longer under the illusion that we have actual news reported to us from mainstream \*anymore.\* I’ve seen media go around stories completely

See Democracy Now and Al Jazeera

And what is the difference with the other candidates?

would condemn Israel and allow the ICC to issue arrest warrants for the main Israeli leaders guilty of genocide? What about

?

So what are you saying? That just because two other candidates would not do anything then Biden shouldn’t either? Makes no sense.

oh please. More than likely Hamas did it to get rid of witnesses.

Oh, please, why would Hamas kill the doctors and nurses that care for their on people? Why would Hamas handcuff children behind their backs and execute them midpoint blank range? They wouldn’t and you know it, but you were in such denial that you will make up the most fabulous

We are shamed, doxed, spit on for our protests of such horrors. Our students are punished for standing up against such depravity, getting kicked out of school and beaten and arrested by cops.

The university students who are speaking up across this country have nothing but my extreme respect. 40 years ago in the 80s when I was an undergrad, we were speaking out against the Israeli occupation of Palestine and I assure you we received zero support from the average

Every Monday and every other day of the week for weeks on end, this massacre haunts so many of us. The powerlessness is like a chokehold.

Yes, it’s forcing us to be party to a literal genocide.
