## Want to Run for Local Office? Here's a "Guide" Based on My Experience in 2017

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/7bxfhz/want_to_run_for_local_office_heres_a_guide_based/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/7bxfhz/want_to_run_for_local_office_heres_a_guide_based/)

> I apologize in advance if this seems a little disorganized; I typed this up in a hurry yesterday and edited it to be less Lenox-specific this afternoon after work. If you have any constructive criticism, or any questions about my experience running, please let me know; I'd hope this could serve as a set of guidelines for progressives to run local races in their towns!
> 
> #***The Preparation Phase***
> 
> **1.** The first step is to assemble a team of folks to help you. They may come from the Town committee or they may be other friends who want to help you. Consider who will serve as the campaign manager, fundraising coordinator, volunteer coordinator, and treasurer. You may end up filling one or more of these roles yourself; for small races, it doesn’t need to be formal, although some endorsement forms ask about a campaign manager. Once you’ve found the folks who will help you, schedule a meeting to plan out everything.
> 
> o	Come up with three reasons to vote for you. This is meant to be concise, but comprehensive; something you can expand on, but stands on its own. What are your strengths and experiences? What do you bring to the table? What will you do when you get elected?
> 
> o	Plan when to send postcards. Typically, you’ll want to send them two or three at a time (spaced out by at least a couple days) in case they get “lost” in a stack of mail that gets tossed out.  Important times to send mailers can include the two-week period before absentee ballots arrive, mail to newly registered left-leaning and neutral voters, and GOTV postcards to registered left-leaning voters and/or voters who have indicated support reminding them to vote for you on the following Tuesday. 
> 
> o	Create a calendar of local community events to attend as the candidate and plug yourself, ask how the town can help them, and let them know you are a friend.
> 
> o	Schedule meetings w/ local organizations to meet people and seek endorsements
> 	EMTs
> 	Volunteer Firemen
> 	Police
> 	Public library
> 	Labor Organizations
> 
> o	Schedule meetings w/ local businesses to meet people and seek endorsements
> 
> o	Schedule meet and greets at local businesses or homes
> 
> o	Schedule fundraising events (RSVP, $X admission, food and drinks, talk about campaign, include other entertainment like local band or perhaps an upballot candidate)
> 
> o	Schedule 1 letter to the editor each week from friends, family, or local figures you’ve met and connected with
> 
> o	Plan any big ad-buys – Facebook/Newspapers/Radio/TV? A video to share on Facebook, promoted for a while, can get a lot of attention for little money and help with name recognition.
> 
> **2.** Take professional photos for materials and social media. Get a high-res headshot and take a few more around town. Get creative!
> 
> **3.** Set up social media for yourself as a public figure. Set up an email and website, too, so folks can research you.
> 
> **4.** Design all the materials you will use in the campaign; this means door hangers, yard signs, etc. If this is difficult, professional printshops can do it for you. Be sure to include your name and the date of the election on both the front/back of the door hanger; some folks will only ever look at one side, so you want the major info to be redundant. Include your “three reasons” on the lit, a headshot, and maybe any scheduled meet and greets.
> 
> **5.**	Write thank you notes to all the community figures that endorse you, along with donors, and take pictures at every event and meeting for social media
> 
> **6.**	Apply for an EIN and use that to open a separate checking account with a bank. Create an online donation service through something like Crowdpac.com. Make social media posts requesting small donations, ask friends/family/local Dems for a small $5/10/20 donation.
> 
> **7.**	Order the campaign materials as soon as possible (from either a local or a union printshop). You can lend your campaign money, although I believe you will need to file a form if you do so and proceed to raise more than 1,000 dollars; see the campaign finance handbook. Keep all receipts. You will need them if you raise over $1,000 for campaign filing. (Anecdotally, 50 signs for my 2017 race were ~300 and change, 2500 palm cards were ~300 and change, and mailers were about .35 cents a postcard or something similar. Keeping it under 1,000 was difficult.)
> 
> **8.** Plan an event to announce your candidacy. Invite friends in town and tell them to invite friends. Have a “suggested” donation of $5, but the main thing is to spread the word. Announce your candidacy and why you want to run. Then, using that language, make a press release announcing your campaign and share the article on Facebook with commentary. Use ad revenue for 7 days before petitioning. At the event, have a sheet where people can sign up to help make phone calls, go petitioning, or go canvassing, and whether they are comfortable doing it on their own or would rather with a buddy.
> 
> 
> #***Petitioning:***
> 
> Average the odd-year turnout over the last three or four elections. That is your estimated turnout. If voters are instructed to vote for one candidate or you have a running mate, your goal is to get at least 52% of the votes. If voters are instructed to vote for two candidates and you have no running mate, you need 68% of the vote, which is a taller order. To get a list with at least that many people (hopefully more unless you expect to convince 100% of people to vote for you) start with left-leaning odd-year voters, independent and no-party odd-year voters, and then right-leaning odd-year voters who do not vote in primaries. If that isn’t sufficient, add left-leaning and neutral voters who voted in the recent midterms. If that isn’t sufficient, add left-leaning voters who voted in the Presidentials, then neutral voters that voted in the Presidentials, and then right-leaning mid-term voters. 
> 
> The reason you focus on left-leaning voters and odd-year voters is because it’s easier to convince odd-year voters to vote for you *or* left-leaning voters to vote in an odd year than it is to both convince folks to vote in an odd year *and* to vote for you. Best practice would be to use VAN, or the Voter Activation Network site on Votebuilder to make these lists. The county chair can set you up with the site. The Board of Elections can also provide some voter lists.
> 
> Organize into turfs by: party, then geographic location. Folks “sign out” turf packets w/ voter info and places to indicate whether they signed your petition and then, for each visit, when the visit was, whether it was successful or not, and how supportive they seemed of the candidates you describe on a scale of 1 to 5.
> 
> **1.** Work as a team. Every committee member is responsible for a full 20 signatures for each candidate on the ticket for each line they pursue; remember to bring a witness or notary as needed.
> 
> **2.** On the first Saturday of petitioning after they open in June, have a big meet-up at a local diner; eat as a team, then go forth. Recognize the first person to complete petitions & the person w/ most petitions, perhaps with some sort of reward.
> 
> **3.** When passing petitions, pass lit as well. Give info on the candidates’ strengths and ask what the voter think about them. Then, ask if they would be willing to sign a petition to get them on the ballot this year. Successfully meeting a voter counts as visit #1; record the data and their reaction. This might sound like:
> 
> *“Hey, my name is John Smith and I’m letting folks know that Smithy John is running for Town Council. He’s a local guy that runs a restaurant, Smithy’s Eats, over in Wampsville. He’s got a good head for business and he want to put it to work to help save some taxpayer money and run things more efficiently. What do you think about a guy like Smithy running for Town Council? I was wondering: would you be willing to sign a petition to help get Smithy on the ballot? He’s a great guy, he’ll make a great town councilperson, and he’d really appreciate your support.”*
> 
> **4.** When you knock on a door, wait ~15 seconds. If no one comes, leave a doorhanger and move on to the next home. 
> 
> **5.** File the certificate of acceptance by the appropriate date at the BOE. 
> 
> NOTE: Your town may caucus, which is more risky if you want to have the line, but is ultimately less work overall. Rules for caucuses should be available at your local BOE.
> 
> #***Post-Petitioning***
> 
> **1.** As the new Dem candidate, send a letter to Dems that voted in at least 2 of the last 3 odd-year elections and to newly registered Dems. Introduce yourself, give them a way to contact you if they have questions or if they want to help, and let them know that if they want to make a small donation of $5, $10, or $20 dollars, they should send cash by mail or make the check payable to the name you selected for your campaign account. Include the schedule of meet and greets and fundraising events.
> 
> To less reliable voters in the 2500, send a letter of introduction asking that they remember your name and you hope to be able to meet with them. Include the schedule of meet and greets.
> 
> **2.** Organize a few phone banks to call constituents and let them know who will be on the ballot.
> 
> o	Left-leaning parties: call all registered w/ phone numbers. If they answer, let them know about the new Democratic candidate, give the 3 strengths, and ask them if they plan to vote; let them know you’d appreciate their support and let them know about the next meet and greet. If no answer, leave a message. Call back the next day; if no answer, leave no message.
> 
> o	Neutral/right-leaning parties: call all odd-year, no primary voters w/ phone numbers w/ the same message.
> 
> **3.** The candidate should try to knock on every door in the target universe at least once personally. At each door, introduce the candidate, pass out the doorhanger, explain why you think they’re a good choice (three reasons again), ask if they plan on voting this year, and say that you hope they’ll consider voting for our candidates. Also ask if they have any friends or family that might need to register to vote. The ideal length of a conversation with a voter should be about two minutes, but if a constituent has a lot on their mind, it doesn’t hurt to take an extra minute or two to hear them out. 
> 
> **4.** If the person isn’t home, leave a doorhanger with a “sorry I missed you” note on it. We will return to these houses.
> 
> **5.** The goal is that every voter will meet with either the candidate or a surrogate at least once in this time in person, have a successful phone-call if they have a valid number on file, have their support rated, AND receive at least one successfully read mailer for a grant total of three contacts. Each door should have at least one successful human interaction and one knock from the candidate, whether it is successful or not. The candidate should ensure that they have a successful knock with newly registered voters. To hit all these doors successfully, you will need help from some volunteers. Start by inviting folks to canvas with you; then, ask if they’d be willing to try doing the houses on one side of the street while you do the other. If they are comfortable with that, ask if they can do a turf packet by themselves.
> 
> **6.** When a turf packet is completely done (every door knocked on at least once by the candidate, or twice with a knock from a surrogate and a second knock from the candidate), enter the data into the Voter Activation Network. If there is no data, it didn’t happen. When everyone’s had at least one knock, if somehow there’s more time left before GOTV, cycle back to the doors that haven’t had a contact yet.
> 
> **7.** On October 1st, signs go out. Start with high-traffic locations, then add offering a sign into canvassing script. All signs should go out by the end of October when we complete canvassing and move onto GOTV.
> 
> #***GOTV***
> 
> **1.** Send 2 or 3 postcards to left-leaning voters and to right/neutral voters who seemed friendly/receptive to our candidates reminding them to get out and vote for our candidates on election day.
> 
> **2.** Organize a phonebank on the Sat/Sun 12-8pm before election to call all left-leaning voters and the right/neutral voters who seemed friendly/receptive to our candidates. Call once to remind them that the election is imminent and, if no one answers, leave a message. Call again and, if no one answers, leave no message; they’ll check their messages or they won’t. Call one last time and, if no one answers, call it quits.
> 
> **3.** Call/message friends and family in town asking them to vote and to remind their close friend and family to do the same.
> 
> **4.** Have a “Don’t Forget to Vote” lit drop to odd-year left-leaning voters and friendly neutral/right voters
> 
> **5.** Organize poll watchers. This will give you info to make calls from that evening reminding folks to go vote.
> 
> **6.** Go to a central location at 9am to collect the first poll-watcher info. Keep the lists updated so that we can begin calls at 5pm to remind folks today is election day. 
> 
> **7.** At 8pm, call it quits and head over to a watch-party to see how you did!
