	I share the same sentiment. I simply called it the new paradigm for about a decade, but in the last year I have shifted to calling it the **ecological paradigm**, and cybernetics is definitely one of its cornerstones. 

	I have sadly learned over the years that the mainstream is at least fifty to one hundred years behind the cutting edge of science, and even then the general public only has a tentative grasp on it.  For example, Quantum Leap premiered in 1989, about 60 years after the Copenhagen Interpretation was introduced, and thirty years after Everett's many-worlds hypothesis.  Or the Scopes trial nearly 70 years after Darwin published his work.

	We were heading towards the ecological paradigm in the 1970s with the development of ecology, complexity and chaos theory, systems engineering, network theory, and of course cybernetics, but just as it looked like the various components were about to gel, the zeitgeist took a hard right turn in the late 70s/early 80s. I saw rumblings again in the 90s with the rise of multiculturalism and transdisciplinary initiatives to foster a broader and more holistic perspective, along with the revival of environmentalism with the Rio conference and the Kyoto Protocol. But then another hard right turn happened with the War on Terrorism, and the 'End of History' BS.

	We are approaching another possible tipping point. Will the third time be the charm?

	I see three or four aspects this time that I didn't see previously. First is the increase in climate change is indisputable regardless of reactionary politicians, and is one of the main motivators of the Global South to seek a new paradigm. Along the same lines, what I am tempted to call **ecological governance** is being developed. ESG reporting, stakeholder management, stewardship ethos, collaborative governance, deliberative democracy, nonviolent conflict resolution and arbitration, etc are all facets. No one has quite consolidated it into a coherent framework yet, but I see a few [articles](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40984102) that suggest one. 

	The other two major aspects I have seen are the development of industrial ecology, the application of ecological principles to industrial processes through the use of life-cycle assessments, environmentally-extended input-output models, and social accounting matrices; and perhaps more critically, the development of [relational value](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2018.09.005) as the foundation of ecological ethics. [Cybernetics](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02604027.2019.1568796) plays a key role in that along with every other subject mentioned above, either explicitly or implicitly.

		The New Paradigm and The Ecological Paradigm are both cool names for it! I've just been calling my notion database for all these different topics and how they relate to each other "interconnection". I've got a list of like 70 things probably, big and small ideas that I see overlapping and interconnecting to build this larger idea that we're discussing. 
		
		Holisitic is also a really good way to put it.
		
		Can i ask, why do you call it the 'ecological paradigm'? It seems to be relevant in a lot of places, more than just ecology, but I'll admit, ecology is (kind of) where my fascination with this started. I though the idea that we are made of cells, which make up tissues, which make up organs, which make up organ systems, which make up organisms, was an absolutely fascinating idea. But then I had the idea, *what if we, as people are just the 'cells' of a much larger system?* I've been diving through countless subjects since then, trying to understand this thought that's been bugging me. 
		
		Not sure where your politics lie, but if it lies towards the left, I have found that there is still a ton of discussion in this field, in the realm of 'Dialectical Materialism'. I've seen enormous overlaps between the rules of Systems Theory and the rules of Dialectical Materialism, and you might find some of that interesting! I really do think a lot of the 'hush-hush' over transdisiplinary science in the contemporary scientific world, at least in the United States, is due to the close connection to left-wing political philosophy that is seen by the west as a threat. I have a reading on that specifically, if you're interested. Would love to discuss it more with you in general if you're interested, because that's where the bulk of my knowledge lies. 
		
		On the topic of ecological governance that you brought up, would you say that decision support systems, such as Walmart's Retail Link, Amazon's RAP system, or even Project Cybersyn, fall under that category? Or would you say that's firmly in cybernetics territory? I know were talking about fields with lots of overlap, but generally speaking?

		* üüß **[Agnosticpagan](https://www.reddit.com/user/Agnosticpagan)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2023-07-06 21:54:08)_

			I began calling it the **ecological paradigm** after seeing the convergence of four separate areas that all labeled themselves 'ecological', i.e. ecological humanism, ecological governance, ecological economics, and industrial ecology. Then it was a very short leap to describe sustainable development as 'ecological industrialism' and the rest clicked into place. The end result would be an 'ecological civilization' based on the new paradigm. Underlying all of it is a holistic, systemic, and synergistic perspective that applied to each area. They were all just different facets of the same gem.
			
			Four further aspects helped solidify the framework. In no particular order, the Eastern view of harmony as the cultivation of mutually beneficial relationships, in contrast to a utilitarian conformity or confluence of individual interests that underlies the Western concept; the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead and its phenomenology (which I find aligns almost perfectly with Buddhist phenomenology; the relational values framework that transcends either materialist instrumentalism or atomistic intrinsic value; and cybernetics with one slight change from the original, instead of 'control', I prefer coordination which implies a very different dynamic, i.e. a multiplicity of 'pilots' that work together rather than submit to any particular one. 
			
			I personally view ecology as the culmination of the natural hierarchy of natural world, i.e. ecological processes rely on biological and geological processes that rely chemical processes that rely on physics and quantum mechanics.  Cybernetic processes are interwoven throughout that determine the natural constraints of the overall environment. Equally important is that the processes are evolutionary and non-deterministic, and also non-teleological. Life is simply an accident, which makes it even more 'sacred' in my view. The question for me has not been 'why we should' do this or that, but 'if we could do this, then what? Does it help us flourish or does it diminish us?' Why the preference for flourishing over diminishing? Because why not?

	I tend to consider it the science of understanding. (Among other things.) 

	I think trying to look at smaller *particles* isn't exactly the way to derive what is most fundamental. Whereas looking at smaller (simpler) *concepts* is more worthwhile.

	Sort of related to Hume's is/ought.

		Isn't everything an ought from the observer's perspective? I'm not saying objective reality isn't real, I'm asking - How many times do I repeat this observation(experiment) before it becomes true?
		
		How does the observer know if the next observation will contradict previous observations? The only way to identify what objectively "is" is to model reality 1:1 which is impossible from within the system itself. We can't build a 1:1 model of the universe from within the universe.
		
		Every human, AI, and decision making system uses a simplified model of reality to describe the world and make predictions. From this perspective, isn't everything an ought?
		
		***
		
		On a related note, do the two modes of thinking, system 1 and system 2(Daniel Kahneman), reflect the is/ought divide within decision making systems?
		
		For example, system 1 represents the "is" simplified model of reality and system 2 represents the error correction by asking "what if"(ought).
		
		Does anyone have any thoughts on this or recommend further reading. I'd love to learn more about this perspective. Happy to discuss.

		* üüß **[Samuel7899](https://www.reddit.com/user/Samuel7899)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2023-07-06 06:24:16)_

			Good questions. I don't think there's enough consensus anywhere. I think I agree though. 
			
			When you look at all that *is*, it's difficult (impossible?) to derive any idea of what *ought* (ought from is). But if you begin with what *ought* (roughly: if life is defined as that which "does something", and what is selected for over time is life that tends to "persist" aka, *live*), (pseudo-) intelligent life benefits significantly as it builds an organized model of what *is*. 
			
			I tend to think of consciousness as essentially the *ought* model in narrative form, which is relatively simple, and the *is* model exists within it.
			
			It's been a while since I read Kahneman, but I'm not sure if I'd say that it reflects system 1 and 2 directly. I might say that system 1 is that which is in ram, and often it's a default and can rely on heuristics. It's also often what less intelligent animals are predominantly capable of.
			
			System 2 would be an additional layer, and not necessarily a separate system, but more of an overlapping system. We can take a belief that we have held since childhood (imagine an optical illusion that we have a quick and easy judgment on, but that is ultimately demonstrated incorrect, such as the parallel lines with arrows at the ends)... We can take this heuristic belief from our ram, analyze it slowly in system 2, apply slower logic, and then, with time and practice, amend the version in our ram (system 1).
			
			So I don't necessarily think system 1 and 2 are directly correlated to our models of what *is* and our narrative model (which starts with a pretty simple idea of self, and evolves as more information comes in and becomes more organized/compressed more efficiently.

			* üü¶ **[HTIDtricky](https://www.reddit.com/user/HTIDtricky)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2023-07-06 09:21:26)_

				Yep, we're in agreement on is/ought but I'll expand my thoughts a little more on system 1 and 2 and how it might be related.
				
				An example Kahneman uses in the book compares a veteran(system 1) and trainee(system 2) firefighter. The veteran uses intuition from years of experience to assess a situation and make quick decisions versus the trainee who methodically goes step by step remembering all of their training. Now, imagine a situation where the veteran makes a mistake. Presumably, they would be sent back to the classroom to receive more training and prevent them making the mistake again.
				
				System 1 is constantly trying to simplify its model of reality with simpler heuristics. System 2 is doing the opposite by expanding concepts, looking in more detail, and correcting errors when system 1 fails.
				
				How many times do I repeat an observation before it becomes true?
				
				System 1: Once is enough, what you see is all there is.
				
				System 2: Ad infinitum, we can't be certain of anything.
				
				Broadly speaking, I think consciousness kind of emerges as a balance between these two systems in a way that minimises maximum regret.

				* üü™ **[Samuel7899](https://www.reddit.com/user/Samuel7899)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2023-07-06 09:46:07)_

					> How many times do I repeat an observation before it becomes true?
					
					This concept itself is subject to the process as well. And it'll be applied subjectively. An average adult with experience rebuilding engines might appreciate the complexity and variability, and "know" that there are lots of little factors that influence the results, but might also still hold a very rudimentary racist generalization.
					
					I think even many relatively smart people don't fully grasp the concepts of probability and chaos. It's only been about 100 years that we've been slowly shifting from what will always happen to what will happen with overwhelming probability.
					
					I will add that I think there's a bit of a resolution to the inability for us to be certain of *anything*. While accurate, it's not *useful* information. Which is to say that if someone actively believes in their day-to-day life that there is nothing that is 100% absolute, their model won't be any more able to predict the future than an alternate model.
					
					Whereas if someone believes in a world/universe/reality in which there is no inherently contradictory information (fundamental paradoxes), they will have a better predictive model of reality. Even if there *is* inherently contradictory information, it is, by definition, unpredictable, and therefore it is of zero value.
					
					I do think that we can believe in this contradiction in particular, constrained ways... Such as at a potential boundary condition of scale (below quantum physics perhaps... I don't know). But not in normal reality.
					
					I'd also add that system 1 isn't necessarily using heuristics to simplify their model, it's just favoring compressed information. The universe, I think, is relatively simple, and we can often find lossless compression in our understanding, to replace more primitive lossy compression that we glean from daily life, our peers, various belief systems, etc.

			I have something i think might be related! Apologies if not, but If I'm understanding correctly. I read a book called 'Noise' by Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony and Cass R. Sunstein. There's a key idea in the book that ***We can cancel out noise by averaging multiple, independent judgments on a single question***. 
			
			Basically, it talks about Wherever there‚Äôs human judgment, there‚Äôll be noise and, sometimes, that noise can have alarming, life-changing consequences.
			
			So, that naturally leads to the question: What can we do about it? How do we turn down the noise?
			
			To answer this, back in the early 1900s, a dude named Francis Galton visited a county fair. He came across an ox-weighing competition. Galton, who among other things, was a theorist of intelligence, listened with curiosity as close to 800 villagers gave their best estimates of the ox‚Äôs weight. No one got the correct answer: 1,198 pounds. When the competition was over, Galton asked the organizers to lend him the tickets for statistical analysis.
			
			When plotted on a graph, the estimates were scattershot. Over here and under there by variable, unpredictable amounts. The villagers were noisy. But, when Galton calculated the mean of the villagers‚Äô estimates, he noticed something surprising. **It was nearly perfect, only off by a single pound.**
			
			Galton had stumbled across a phenomenon now known as the **wisdom-of-crowds effect**. In hundreds of different circumstances, getting independent judgments from multiple judges and then averaging their responses has been shown to bring you close to the truth.
			
			When you ask people to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar, the distance of a randomly chosen city, or the temperature a week from today, their answers will vary. They‚Äôll be noisy. However, when averaged out, the noise in one response counteracts the contradictory noise in another. The noise cancels itself out.
			
			Hopefully that's relevant to what you meant there! The idea that the more you repeat an experiment, especially involving subjective observational perspective, the closer you get to the correct answer (not accounting for potential bias!)

			* üü¶ **[HTIDtricky](https://www.reddit.com/user/HTIDtricky)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2023-07-07 03:10:31)_

				Sure, multiple observations will reduce noise but I think the wisdom of crowds is a little misleading.
				
				My thoughts on the WoC isn't based on any research, this is just my personal opinion. It's certainly something to look into but take my comment with a pinch of salt.
				
				I think WoC is partly right but still gets a few things wrong. For example, imagine asking a group of people to look at the [M√ºller-Lyer illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller-Lyer_illusion) and guess which line is longer. The majority of participants will guess one line is longer versus few people who will guess they're the same. The average here will be skewed away from the correct answer.
				
				The problem also occurs with many types of cognitive bias. A scientifically rigorous experiment will try to account for these biases and reduce them where possible.
				
				WoC is correct, in that multiple observations will reduce noise, but on its own is only part of the solution. Sometimes even a large group of people can be tricked by illusion or bias.

		When we are looking at stuff at a systematic/philosophical level, what is the difference between a "particle" and a "smaller concept"? Are you talking about literal universal particles?

	since you mention dialectical materialism i take it you've read at least some marxists.I am personally kinda sad that marxists never really managed to cohere around more modern understandings for their basis for "materialist" analysis and seem stuck in the 19th century physics and metaphysics.

	Like there's huge potential for someone with actual cred in cybernetics and information theory to come in and swap out the dialectics in marxist thought with a more modern, less esoteric basis that can be taken seriously in the 20th and now 21st century without seeming like a cult.

	mind you I'm not saying dialectics is bullshit, but what marxists mean by it is kind of hard to understand to the outside and often specifically used as a vague term to shield themselves from criticism. I "get" what they mean by it but it's a worldview that is rooted in a 19th century understanding of the world that they just cling to religiously

		* üüß **[Chabamaster](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chabamaster)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2023-11-07 03:30:34)_

			okay so I'm not a pro, I haven't read primary literature on most of this and I'm basically an interested layman but in general as far as I understand it:
			
			Hegelianism was one of the main schools of thought influencing 19th century german academics. Hegels use of dialectics presupposes an eternal spirit that has a tendency towards freedom and this pattern of dialectics (moving forward through contradiction and negation) is the way both "ideas" and thus the universe overall tends to move.
			
			Marx takes this and inverts it basically to say "yea but what if the spirit/idea is actually material circumstances instead, and the contradiction in material circumstances moves us forward". This is cool and the way he argues that material circumstances shape society is foundational to a lot of thinkers going forward.He also takes this to say there are primary contradictions in history and overcoming these moves us forward -> class struggle.
			
			This serves his political goals quite well, but attached to it are a few things that imo lead later marxists into a bit of a philosophical/ideological trap, namely:
			
			\- the "stages" concept of history, which seems true at first glance but doesn't really stand up to what we now know about older societies. Especially since even in marx it only applies to europe and brackets out whole chunks of the world.
			
			\- drawing a clear forward momentum and seeing yourself as fulfilling the hingepoint of history, which is bound move to an end point (telos). Even if you were to overcome capitalism now, there's a clear "endpoint" where the assumption is that there are no new contradiction in whatever socialist society we form. Marx (and marxists) basically thought that "now must be the moment" multiple times since the 1840s, and it still hasn't happened yet.
			
			\- Overly focusing on the worker &lt;-> bourgeois contradiction. This was perfectly sensible in a time where society tended towards more and more people emiserated in bigger and bigger factories but has really been muddled and complicated since, and many marxists struggle with this.
			
			\- Supposing that resolving contradictions is a linear process in time (as in thesis emerges -> antithesis emerges -> resolution) instead of a constant tugging of forces moving between equilibriums
			
			this reached increasingly bad levels in the soviet union where the state propaganda was basically "we are the agents of history, thus what we do is by definition for the worker" and basically using dialectical materialism as self justifictation.
			
			Imo after having read up a bit on both cybernetics and marxism it becomes fairly clear that if control theory, information theory and feedback loops had been a thing Marx surely would have used those concepts to build a very similar body of theory as he did and come to similar conclusions, just with less emphasis on duality and a broader understanding of interconnectedness that is actually rooted in physically explainable things.

	Along with what you've mentioned, I add to the mix Taoism, multiverse, quantum. (Personally I also find the concepts - and images - in alchemy riddled with complexity science)

	I think there is a pattern of concepts like these becoming mainstream. For example, Disney's Elemental. Everything Everywhere, All At Once.

	If you haven't already, look into **Spiral Dynamics** might be worth your time.

	In it, it moves between individual and collective movements. Systematic (systems thinking) is followed by Holistic (interconnection). I found it helpful to add to my language base.

	Cybernetics and systems theory (systems science) are two very closely related academic disciplines arising in the post-war environment dealing with the nature and evolution of complex information systems. Where systems science puts more emphasis on formal (mathematical) models of complex, hierarchical systems in an interdisciplinary context, cybernetics puts more emphasis on philosophical models of communicating and semiotic systems involving circularity, self-reference, and recursion. Many practitioners do both, or don't distinguish them. Over time, many of the other ideas mentioned by the OP above have been considered in the cybernetics/systems orbit: fractals as recurrent patterns, chaos theory in terms of complex systems generally, etc.

	I am currently at the point of agreeing with Bogdanov, who foresaw most of that in it Tektology. 

	All your examples are historically contigent attempts to arrive at a general science of organization. 

	Abstract from the field where you make a discovery and focus on the interplay of elements involved. You will more or less automatically end up with these kind of categories that have evolved (sometimes redundantely [redundancy is such a category, just saying]) in the different systemic fields.

	The odd one in there is dialectics, and it hints at the foundational act when doing organizational science - what it gives birth to is rules how categories logically behave. Or, more precisely, what makes categories appear, stabilize and decay in the first place. Hence the universal processism you described.
