## This is brilliant. “Held hostage,” not open air prison. “Threatened,” not “evacuated.”

"Today's copyright lesson is going to be a bit different. We're going to look at the words that have allowed us to witness this genocide in real time
There's a million reasons to focus on words
But I want to tell you this because I actually get paid to write people pay me to write the words that convince you to buy stuff
It's called being a copyrighter. So I read crap like this
To influence you and to buying stuff slightly emotionally manipulating you to think you're inadequate until you have a product or a service
That's my job
To do my job the most sought after
qualification is not English or writing or it's being a journalist
By virtue of you being a journalist what you've been doing is you've been emotionally
manipulating people on mass to either believe something think something feel something
Every day. So it's actually very good training
The first word we're going to look at is evacuate now when you hear the word evacuate
Yes, you think there's a little bit of haste but I want you to really think about what the hell that word means
Getting loads of people out from one place to another place now. How do you do that with a million people?
Because if we visualize what it looks like to evacuate one stadium worth of people
It's a lot of people now multiply that by a whole city and take away all the roads and infrastructure
But now imagine that every single person in that scenario has been told to leave because they're going to bomb their house
So the best analogy for this is what word would you describe if a school shooter showed you their gun and said you've got a few seconds to escape
Are they evacuating you? Is that the word you would use someone is telling you either get out of this place in a
unrealistic space of time down a road that's impossible to go down or your life ends
Are they evacuating you or are they threatening you with death?
Most people are agreeing that that's closer to a death threat
Then it is in evacuation now if you threaten
1.1 million people of a specific race with death that's called a genocide
So what you've got there is the conclusion that you evacuate is actually too neutral a term for the active violence that's going on
And once you start neutralizing violence you start numbing people to the reality of what's been happening
Let's deal with this open air
Prison the moment I say someone's in prison you're gonna be like what did they do wrong?
An open air starts to sound like a good deal
Actually for someone who's done wrong and now with prisons usually there's some kind of sentencing or whatever that everyone agrees
But this state is unconditional not only is it unconditional
But the logic that we're supposed to try and follow through with this is that there are six year olds who were in prison for the 10 years that preceded their life
And now spend the six years they've been alive in prison right but they haven't done an uh-oh to land them in here
And if by virtue of reality you haven't done an uh-oh
To be in here and you are here against your will and your movement is restricted
So is your food so is your water so is your chances of education
You are not a prisoner you're a hostage
But they can't use the word hostage because then that makes them sound like they've done an uh-oh
Because to hold these people hostage here from birth until death
indefinitely is actually doesn't sound good does it so open air prison sounds fine
Doesn't sound great, but it sounds fine for people who've done stuff wrong
So not not evacuate
actual death threat not open air prison
Actual hostage you've done active harm that's what's happened
You've done active harm and then you've got no we haven't
They're pitching this crap as consequences, but they're not
You're that active
violent actions when we look back at previous genocides
We don't look at the nuance of headlines
That's what's going to happen in decades to come
People are going to look at the facts and figures of this situation
Which are brutal and they're going to say how come there were people on the side of this genocide
How come there were people who were okay with it or even
Silent
When they heard this and these people later are going to be embarrassed because the constant bombardment of these language tricks are not
On them all the time so in hindsight just like Iraq people are going to be embarrassed that they fell for it
But the truth is they're not better at this and spotting this than the people who have spent decades
Perfecting the language of emotional manipulation. You're not smarter than that
It's built to outsmart you and so now we need to know what to look out for when it's violence call it violence
When it's active call it active these are not consequences to anyone's actions
Once you start believing that what's happening is a consequence to someone's actions
That's when you start thinking it's a neutral pain field. It isn't I can deconstruct this language for hours
But you need to do this for yourself to get the truth you can listen to people on the ground
People who are just showing you the situation that's where the truth is people who are fighting for the idea
And plainly in English saying no, we actually are here to kill civilians
That's the truth
Listen to the people who are not media trained that's where the truth is you should know that
When a journalist starts something with oh, this is a very complex issue when it goes back to and you immediately switch off
That's what they wanted you to do
They wanted you to think that this is above you
Mentally in your capacity to understand that genocide is wrong
That's how insidious this is
They know when they're asking you to switch off and they know when they want you engaged"
