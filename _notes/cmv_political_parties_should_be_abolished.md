## CMV: Political Parties should be abolished

Without this blind adherence to party, they'd be able to say what they feel and not be trapped in their cult.

But that organization is laid to waste with gridlock and sometimes even corrupted, with partisan gerrymandering being one of the most ridiculous things ever made (and another casualty of us having parties at all). As for galvanization, surely people would be more inclined to vote if they had more than two options? And the options weren't about red or blue, but actual character, history, and policy?

Nothing ever gets done in congress because everyone votes along party lines, instead of what they actually believe in or what their constituents voted them in for. If there were no political parties, something, ANYTHING, would actually be done. 

	That thing would be forming parties.

	Because in order to pass something you need 50 votes. So, you gather the people who more or less agree in one group, and then everyone of them promises to aid one another, promises to vote for each other's laws and sets up various systems to make it all work.

	Parties are an emergent feature of any kind of voting system that relies on multiple representatives coming to an agreement as long as that system goes on long enough.

	Why would you have any of that. 

	Far more likely is that you have even fewer options, because no one has any faint idea of what is politically viable, because you don't yet know what hte big power blocks are.

			A gridlock exists when 2 parties, or coalitions, hold the vast majority of power in a democratic body. But a 5+ party group where nobody has a majority is ideal for passing a variety of laws from different sides. Imagine the Red Party has a proposal, but only 30% of the voting power. The Blue party has 35% and will never vote for them as they're enemies. However, the Green party has 15% and the Yellow party has 10% and the Purple party has 5%. If you can convince two of them to vote with you, you pass your bill. And then those same two can vote for the proposal of the Blue party in another aspect of society. And then you can actually cooperate with the Blue party to vote on another thing that the Green, Yellow and Purple parties don't like. 
			
			If the US senate and house actually had some representation from the Green, Libertarian, Constitution, Socialist or whatever other parties, and the Democrats and Republicans had to appease those representatives you'd see things being done. Libertarians would vote with Democrats to legalize weed, Green Party would vote against the democrats more corporatist laws, Consitution party would only vote for GOP proposals that address their issues, etc.

			Ideally a nation would have several political parties, none of which even being close to a majority on their own. This would incentivize building broad coalitions based on actual policy concerns.

					Yes, because of the "first past the post" electoral system in which only the single "winner" matters. It is perfectly possible to have a different system, such as proportional representation, that promotes a multi-party government where it's not about who gets the most votes but rather - who is able to form a majority coalition with the other groups most closely aligned in policy goals.

					Well, yes and no. We do technically have more than two parties, but none of them hold seats at the Congressional level. 
					
					If a meaningful third party ever emerges in the US, it will be from the ground up. It’ll gain popularity at the local or state level, win some Congressional seats, maybe make its way into the Senate or a couple Governorships, and then it can run a viable Presidential campaign. 
					
					This is also just a pet theory of mine, but I really do think that when this third party emerges it won’t be as clear-cut as splitting the vote on one side. It’ll bring out a whole lot of habitual non-voters and jaded citizens on both sides. Maybe one side will take a bigger hit, but it won’t be a clean distinction.

			> In theory hat would make sense, but in practice t nothing gets done. Neither side wants to compromise, so no bill ever gets passed, or it's passed with such restrictive measures that it has little impact. So with or without political parties, nothing would happen.
			
			That's the point. Societies that change rapidly because the government can pass and implement sweeping reforms at the drop of a hat not only tend to be highly autocratic (a la Stalin's Five Year ~~Genocide~~ Plans) but also highly unstable. It's important economically for a country to have consistent and stable laws if you want to have any semblance of a free market. Why take a risk and invest in something when you don't know if that industry you're investing in will be banned tomorrow?
			
			The political gridlock that you see in Congress today essentially means that the only things that get passed are things *everyone* agrees on. You know, forcing compromise.

	And how do you propose we do this? There's no law that created political parties, nor is there any law that requires them. They began as informal coalitions and simply adopted greater structure as they evolved. They aren't contrived, they're a natural development in a political system that relies on coalition-building, and this is particularly true in the U.S. with our first-past-the-post election system, which requires that coalition-building happen *before* elections.

			> How it would be done is different than if it should or not
			
			The problem with this argument comes when the proposed legislation, while it could be 100% benevolent in theory, becomes a nightmare or impossible to implement.
			
			Let's say that we should make being a jerk illegal. Like, we all agree that being a jerk is bad, and I'm not saying that jerks should be executed, maybe just a small fine. How do we implement that? What constitutes as being a jerk? Where is the border between being a jerk and a norma human emotional response to an stimulus from another party? How do we prove that a person was a jerk to someone else? What about the likeness of the inequality created by that law? Certainly rich people could continue being jerks and pay their fines without any issue while poor people (who might even be innocent of being a jerk in the first place but end up victims of having bad lawyers versus the lawyers of someone wealthier) might get destroyed by the small fine (and also the crime in their permanent record ends up harming their professional careers). Will all of the extra hurdle placed on society (both the need for judge, juries, lawyers and bureaucrats to dedicate a good amount of their professional time to deal with jerk accusations and normal people both needing to fill cases and pay fines due to being found guilty) outweigh the pros that it creates (the theoretical would-be-jerks that were deterred from being one due to the law existing)?
			
			This is a real argument against these kinds of similar views which might be 100% benevolent from OP's side but the reality is that we are either better off without them or even trying to apply them would be impossible. Common views like that are like "people should need a license to parent a child", "people should pass an exam to vote", etc.

			I disagree. The means are an essential part of the ends. The only way to abolish political parties, as far as I'm aware, is to adopt a one-party system, which I'm fundamentally against. That, or a restriction of free association, which would be unconstitutional in the U.S. "We should live in a utopia" is not a serious CMV.

		* 🟧 **[AusIV](https://www.reddit.com/user/AusIV)** ⬆️ 6 _(2021-08-10 18:30:09)_

			Here's how:
			
			Political parties are a mathematically guaranteed outcome of first-past-the-post voting. Say you have six candidates for a single office. If everyone gets to vote for exactly one person, each candidate gets about 16% of the vote. Someone comes out a little bit ahead and wins. On the opposite site of the political spectrum, people who are especially unhappy with this win get together and decide that instead of running two candidates with moderately different opinions, they're going to run one candidate that represents those two factions reasonably well. Next election you have 5 candidates, 4 of whom get about 16% of the vote and one of whom gets about 30%. Now the people on the opposite side of the political spectrum freak out and do the same thing. One of those candidates drops out and throws their support behind a candidate with reasonably similar views. Now you have two candidates at 30% each and 2 candidates at about 20% each. The two remaining candidates know they don't stand a chance against the bigger candidates, so they drop out. Now you have a two party system.
			
			We don't have to use first-past-the-post voting though. Ranked Choice Voting is an option. People can go in and rank the 6 candidates based on who they liked best and who they thought was an acceptable compromise, down to who they really don't want to see win. There are different ways of tallying Ranked Choice ballots (which I'll go into in another comment if you're interested), but the gist is that you can arrive at the candidate most preferred by the most voters, rather than having to form coalitions prior to the election to have any chance of having your views represented.
			
			This also has a side effect of making elections a lot less hostile. In a first-past-the-post election, candidates are incentivized to villainize their opponent. Yes, their opponent's followers will be mad at them, but they were never going to get those votes anyway, and villainizing their opponent rallies their base. With a ranked choice voting system, a candidate can accept that they're not going to be the first choice for a particular demographic of candidates, but still try to appeal to them to be ranked #2 or #3. Villainizing the candidate they really like might get you dropped from their list, while explaining why you still align on a lot of issues might get you ranked just behind their preferred candidate.
			
			If you outright ban parties, people will still find ways to organize around a small set of candidates. First-past-the-post voting demands it. If you change from first-past-the-post voting to ranked choice voting, the need for parties largely goes away on its own.

			* 🟦 **[parentheticalobject](https://www.reddit.com/user/parentheticalobject)** ⬆️ 2 _(2021-08-10 21:41:06)_

				Parties absolutely still exist in places with ranked choice voting. It makes it slightly easier for a candidate from a smaller candidate's supporters to give them some votes that will eventually go to a larger candidate, but parties still exist, and they would mostly be the same parties in the short run. Who do you honestly think would have won the 2020 presidential election if it had been ranked choice?

				* 🟪 **[AusIV](https://www.reddit.com/user/AusIV)** ⬆️ 2 _(2021-08-11 07:58:07)_

					That probably depends on what mechanism you use to tally votes.
					
					Ranked choice describes how people cast votes, but there are multiple ways to tally ranked choice votes. 
					
					The most common is instant runoff voting, where you count up everybody's first choice vote, drop the lowest choice candidate, reallocate the dropped candidates ballots to the remaining candidates based on their next choice, and repeat until you have a candidate with more than half the votes.
					
					But this has kind of pathological case that eliminates moderate candidates in early rounds. Suppose you had three candidates, a Democrat with 49% of the vote a Republican with 49% of the vote, and a moderate independent with 2% of the vote, but the independent was the second choice for virtually all of the Republicans and all of the Democrats. Under instant runoff voting, the moderate gets eliminated first, and their votes get real located between the other candidates, even though 51% of voters ranked the moderate above the winning candidate.
					
					Condorcet voting fixes this. It simulates races between each pairing of candidates, and the candidate that wins the most races is elected. Using the same example as above, in the moderate v republican race the moderate wind 51/49, moderate v democrat the moderate wins 51/49, republican v democrat is a toss up, but the moderate won 2/3 races (every race they were on), so the moderate is elected.
					
					If we used instant runoff voting, I think it would take a long time to see a significant shift, and that shift would probably come up in congressional and senate races sooner than presidential races.
					
					If we used Condorcet, I think there's a decent chance that we'd see a moderate independent emerge as a very popular second choice, and which may be enough to win the first election cycle.

					* 🟥 **[parentheticalobject](https://www.reddit.com/user/parentheticalobject)** ⬆️ 1 _(2021-08-11 11:07:36)_

						It's a bit of an unanswerable philosophical conundrum if the candidate produced by Condorcet voting is really better than one produced with instant runoff or other methods. Imagine you have, say, 20% radicals and 28-30% moderates on either side and 2% centrists. Is it better to have a result where 2% are happy, 58% are slightly unhappy, and 40% are very unhappy, or a result where 30% are happy, 22% are slightly unhappy, and 48% are very unhappy or extremely mad? You could rationally argue that either is better.
						
						And that's before getting into the much more complicated question of what a "moderate candidate" even is in modern America. There are a plethora of issues where making *any* solid statement will make you politically unpalatable to some 30-45% of Americans. Any actual platform a moderate independent candidate comes up with will be hated by the center left, center right, or both. Strategic voting is still possible in such an election; Even if you're allowed to mark preferences 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, if you believe the candidate you support is likely to win without the existence of the moderate, you don't *have to* rank them as higher than the other people you really dislike.

					It’s less a matter of how we vote people in but the fact that group cooperation requires forming groups to get support. It doesn’t really matter what form of government you have, whether it is tribal hunter gatherers led by the dominant male of the family and his friends or the modern USA and its democratic constitution or the Chinese one party system or the Russian government mostly controlled by Putin or the King of England ruling the British empire or the Pharoah ruling ancient Egypt or Kim Jong Un officiating as the God of North Korea. They all have something akin to political parties. And even when there is only one dominant political party it creates its own form of political BS.
					
					Ultimately it takes a group of people to influence the behavior of a large group. Larger coalitions do it better than any single individual or a smaller coalitions. Circumstances change the exact nature of the coalitions.
					
					The BS comes down to human nature. We’re all self interested dumb animals. Coalitions form and compete, and hard as it may seem to believe, on average over time they tend to get better. That may seem hard to believe with recent politics in the US, but at least all we had was a Trump insurrection with half a dozen deaths and not World War 3 with tens of millions of deaths or another invasion of the Middle East or Vietnam War, and we only had a brief economic recession due to Covid rather than a 1930s Great Depression.
					
					I’m optimistic for the future, but there is a lot of BS that needs to be worked out in the meantime, and it will take generations or centuries to get there. Progress matches on slowly.

	What is your alternative? Just individual people running for congress and discussing things there? The nature of humans as social species would suggest that some form of fractions, movements or political parties would arise naturally among people who have similar views. Additionally, one person can‘t be an expert on every single thing that‘s discussed in congress. Having a party with experts on different issues seems like a helpful thing.

	It also seems like your grievances lie more with the two-party system in the US or their specific policies than anything else. Just because you don‘t like the parties, that doesn‘t mean they are useless in general. And with changes to the election system, more than two parties could play a relevant role as you can see in other countries.

	It is impossible to eliminate political parties in any kind of democratic or representative form of government. Even in non-democratic systems you still get political parties. Even in authoritarian autocracies or old-style divine right monarchies you had analogs of political parties (albeit under different names).

	Political parties are just the natural result of any decision making process, especially deliberative bodies, with a sufficient number of different people.

	Say you have a hypothetical legislature with no political parties. Every single member got their on their own merit, solely supporting their own ideas, etc. Now put that legislature into action. Individual members will introduce bills/motions they want to pass. They'll then try to convince other members to support them. Maybe Jones has a bill she really wants to pass and Williams agrees to support it, but only if Jones will also support Williams' bill. Now the two of them go around and get support from more and more members, each of whom has their own priorities they want the others to support in exchange for their votes. Now maybe this coalition gets big enough that they're only a handful of members shy of passing everything every member wants, but they can't convince anyone else to join them. However, there's an election coming up. So they go to the district of one of the members who won't support them and find someone who *will* support their coalition. They donate some money and give support to help that person defeat the uncooperative member. Now the coalition has 1 more vote on their side. Pretty soon they're doing this same operation in every district to get as many votes on their side as possible.

	A political party has just formed spontaneously. There's no way to avoid it.

	I used the following argument in another CMV about the same subject.

	In order to eliminate political parties, you would have to stop ALL POSSIBLE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POLITICIANS. You would also have to stop them collaborating too. Here is why.

	Let's say you make political parties illegal. No more democrats, no more republicans, no more communist party. You would think it would prevent politicians from forming a power block right? Nope.

	Instead, they'll just make a club that is totally not a party and keep working the same way. They can even pretend to play bowling in order to go around the no political party rule.

	And let's say you stop politicians from belonging to the same club. Well now they'll just talk with each other. Say Bob and Alice are on board with the group to vote for that policy and so on. And you're back with political parties again.

	Prevent them from talking? Hand signs or written letters.

	Political parties are a consequence of people associating with each other, not the cause.

	Remove political parties and the ex-party members will do exactly the same thing as before, just not "officially".

	>Nothing ever gets done in congress because everyone votes along party lines

	Nope, it has nothing to do with that. "Nothing gets done", because there is not enough people who care enough for that topic to make it a party focus. Take away parties and not only not much changes, because people will still vote for people representing similar policies.  

	If a certain policy is unattainable now because of "party line" it would be unattainable without parties, as it's too fringe to get a voting capital on it.  

	So instead of few blocks with clear ideas that will vote as a group and work on laws as a group, you will have hundreds of individuals trying to agree on a topic. It not only guarantees that nothing will get done, but will also guarantee that less gets done when compared to current party system.  

	Not to mention the clusterfuck which would be choosing who to vote on. You can market one idea and not say something that would be unpopular, to pass your agenda. Elected could also be swayed easier by lobbying, as now it's not possible to just buy some people, you have to buy whole party.

	That's like saying "money is evil, we should abolish money." Politics is politics, if you ban parties nothing will change - politicians will still form coalitions, and play political games to achieve political goals. 

	If you don't believe me, you can look at other countries where the standard is to have many parties, and not just two or three big ones, and it's all backroom coalitions, drama, and lies.

	There is no for or against political parties. They are an inevitable construct of a voting system with first-passed-the-post voting and simple member districts. This is known as Duverger's Law.

	There is no abolishing political parties because they are merely a form of association. Because our system incentivizes it, they are a primarily binary form of association.

	You could change the voting system, but that wouldn't get rid of parties, it would just allow more to compete. 

	There simply isn't a way of getting rid of political parties without curtailing free speech, assembly, and association. Is that what you want?

	The problem is that when people are put together in large numbers, they naturally congregate into like minded groups.  

	Even if you abolished all political parties tommorrow people would still have differing view and find like minded individuals.  

	There is no way to effectively stop or prevent political parties activities, as they arise from human nature.

	This stance is brought up often, and frequently seems rooted in a certain degree of naïveté about how the world works.  People will always inherently organize themselves into alliances to achieve their goals, and even if you attempted to ban parties they would form as de-facto but unofficial organizations.  

	To achieve such a ban you'd have to ban pretty much any for of human interaction or communication with each other, as otherwise such factions would form. That's obviously not tenable.

	Political parties have a very, very important function in the US today: limiting the number of people on the ballot. 

	Plurality voting works best when there's 2 candidates, because of vote splitting.  If you had a presidential election that was Biden vs Sanders vs Warren vs Buttigieg vs Rubio vs Cruz vs Trump vs Fiorina vs etc etc etc, the winner would likely have 10% of the vote.  The winner would also be highly dependant on which "side" ran more candidates.

	If you want to get rid of parties,  a very important first step is replacing the voting system with something that scales well to very wide fields of candidates, like Score voting, STAR, 3-2-1, Approval or the Condorcet methods.

	Freedom of association. Parties are free speech protected by the constitution as a human right. To ban parties would be simply to ban people who think alike from talking with one another. 

	Second, I think your understand if party in politics is born out of valid frustration, but it’s fucked up and fairly uneducated. It’s popular to shot on parties on social media, but people forget that a political party is an engine of democracy. George Washington was wrong, democracy cannot exist without party.

	You didn’t respond to any other comments yet, so I don’t know if any of them managed to persuade you, but just in case they didn’t let me try a different tack.

	Even putting aside things like how like-minded people will form groups and alliances regardless, let’s look at the process of getting into political office itself- over 90% of the time, Congress seats are won by the candidate with the most money to spend. Without political parties and the support they provide, the people who would be capable of raising this much money on their own would be almost invariably wealthy, or somehow otherwise well-known. Assuming this effect trickles down to any extent, and I’ve seen no evidence that it doesn’t, then even state level elections would end up largely being won by those who have the most money. If corruption is a worry, I can’t imagine that essentially taking away the chance for people who aren’t upper-class to reach any government above local would be a good thing.

	Why do you think more will get done without parties? People will still have to settle for a mediocre candidate if they want them to win. The real problem is we don't have a majority voting system, but rather, a plurality one. We could fix the problems you are talking about by using a ranked-choice voting system.

		Ranked choices leads to representatives which better reflect the population, but doesn't necessarily lead to less gridlock. 
		
		You need 51 votes to pass the Senate. If there are several parties, and no coalition of parties can ever reach 51 percent, then nothing happens. You get gridlock. 
		
		Having 60 people who all agree with each other, helps prevent gridlock, though may not accurately reflect the will of the people. 
		
		Or are you proposing that legislation itself somehow also be ranked choice in addition to how elections are run?

	> Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Green Party, etc. They should all be annihilated from the face of the planet.

	How on earth are you going to annihilate voting coalitions in a democratic system?

	> Political Parties are tools of oppression and gridlock.

	Parties are a coalition of mostly likeminded people.

	> Nothing ever gets done in congress because everyone votes along party lines, instead of what they actually believe in or what their constituents voted them in for. 

	Not true. Things do get done, but flashy populist stuff gets stalled. That is a feature, not a bug.

	> Not only that, but we as voters would have more flexible options on what to do on certain issues. Instead of a binary, all or nothing approach towards triggering topics like abortion, gun control, immigration, and so on, we'd have comprehensive solutions that actually address the issue, instead of political catchphrases that hold no water and are dead on arrival.

	No.

	> Not only that, but parties often become centered one person or ideal, with anyone not toeing the party line seen as a traitor. 

	So first you argue that nothing gets done because everyone votes along party lines, but then immediately after you admit that individuals do vote against their party?

	Do you not see your own contradiction here?

	> The argument FOR political parties is that they help organize people and galvanize them towards action.

	Political parties are inevitable in a democratic system. A single vote cannot do anything in a democracy, it requires a voting coalition to get something done; and likeminded representatives are going to help each other out because it benefits them to do so.

	So even if you abolished the current political parties, their dopplegangers would spring forth immediately in their wake, because *thats how things get done in a democracy*.

	> The argument FOR political parties is that they help organize people and galvanize them towards action. But that organization is laid to waste with gridlock 

	[In the American system, gridlock is a feature, not a bug.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggz_gd--UO0)

	>  As for galvanization, surely people would be more inclined to vote if they had more than two options?

	Citation needed. In my experience most non-voters simply don't care what happens.

	> Political Parties have always frustrated me to no end, and any way you slice it, I don't see what little good they do isn't massively overshadowed by the damage to democracy they make.
