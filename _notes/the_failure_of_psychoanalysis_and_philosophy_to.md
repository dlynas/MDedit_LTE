	Just because Freud negated certain philosophical beliefs and traditions does not mean psychoanalysis is distinct from philosophy, does it? As far as I understand it, psychoanalysis is an extension of philosophy.

	* üü® **[vikingsquad](https://www.reddit.com/user/vikingsquad)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 10 _(2024-05-08 13:41:53)_

		It seems to me that the article isn‚Äôt posing psychoanalysis as a rupture with philosophy, but a lamination on or extension of philosophy and that they‚Äôre both implicated within one another: 
		
		> The attempts of psychoanalysis to distance itself from, or even directly negate, philosophy appear to inevitably fall short. Philosophy at the same time seems to presuppose the psychoanalytic method. Thus whilst psychoanalysis may reveal to philosophy what it has yet to comprehend about itself, philosophy provides a frame, a method of reasoning, a formally comparable logic, by which the problematics and inconsistencies of psychoanalysis can be formulated.

			Isn‚Äôt this just true because philosophy provides a frame/method of reasoning/logic by which anything and everything can be formulated?

			* üü¶ **[conqueringflesh](https://www.reddit.com/user/conqueringflesh)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2024-05-09 09:23:12)_

				Or is it that philosophy and psychoanalysis (and others) draw from the same frame that belongs to neither?

				* üü™ **[redditaccount001](https://www.reddit.com/user/redditaccount001)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 3 _(2024-05-09 13:37:03)_

					I don‚Äôt think so, because philosophy includes the study of such frames in general. Philosophy isn‚Äôt just limited to the study of reasoning or the study of methods of reasoning, it also contains the study of the conditions of the possibility of reasoning in general. I think the OP is not totally accurate in describing the motivation behind psychoanalysis‚Äôs ‚Äúnegation‚Äù of philosophy. With psychoanalysis, Freud was not trying to come up with a way of reasoning that transcended or could be thought of outside of the bounds of philosophy, he was trying to generate an empirical account of how the mind works in order to treat people with psychological problems.

					* üü• **[conqueringflesh](https://www.reddit.com/user/conqueringflesh)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2024-05-09 14:01:58)_

						But then this would or could render anything and everything 'philosophical' (and for that matter, non-philosophical). It still begs the question. Philosophia perennis et perniciosus.
						
						
						I also disagree with the reduction that Psa, including Freud's Psa, is exclusively or even primarily therapeutic in intent or by nature.

						* üü´ **[redditaccount001](https://www.reddit.com/user/redditaccount001)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2024-05-09 14:20:53)_

							Everything is ‚Äúphilosophical‚Äù in that philosophy literally is the study of the basic questions that underly everything. If by repudiating or escaping philosophy you mean going outside of philosophically rigorous systems then I agree but it‚Äôs not possible to think in a way that is more fundamental than the objects of philosophical inquiry. Even if you take the route that what Freud was doing was closer to historical or literary interpretation than philosophy of mind or empirical psychology, that doesn‚Äôt mean that it is some kind of reasoning that is not known or practiced by philosophers.
							
							I don‚Äôt mean that Freud‚Äôs work was exclusively therapeutic, what I mean is that the clinical aspect of his mission is one of the primary reasons why he distanced himself from philosophy.

							* ‚¨õÔ∏è **[conqueringflesh](https://www.reddit.com/user/conqueringflesh)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2024-05-09 19:42:39)_

								I think what we have here is an axiomatic disagreement (agree to disagree). I don't think philosophy is primary. It's one way of looking at and existing in the world, no more, no less - like anything else. A philosopher is no better or worse at understanding the universe than a plumber (actually, in many ways and certainly in my experience, worse).
								
								
								To your other point though, it does get me thinking: is Psa in competition with philosophy? For...happiness? And to flip the argument around, was philosophy the original therapy, the lyceum the OG clinic? If so, the question becomes: not what's philosophical in the non-philosophical, but the non-philosophical that 'nevertheless persists' in the most rigorous philosophy.

								* ‚¨úÔ∏è **[redditaccount001](https://www.reddit.com/user/redditaccount001)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 4 _(2024-05-09 20:58:05)_

									Yeah I think we just disagree on the definition/domain of philosophy. For me, anyone who thinks about these fundamental questions is doing philosophy (whether plumber or professor).

* üü© **[conqueringflesh](https://www.reddit.com/user/conqueringflesh)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 7 _(2024-05-08 11:16:17)_

	I think the issue really comes down to not just ontology, but ontological commitment. Does Psa have an ontology? Probably. An ontological commitment? Not really.

	* üü® **[vikingsquad](https://www.reddit.com/user/vikingsquad)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 5 _(2024-05-08 13:38:53)_

		Could you say more about the distinction between having an ontology/ontological commitment? Without knowing more about how you‚Äôre distinguishing, I‚Äôm tempted to say there‚Äôs ontological commitments that are at least *latent* in any given analytic framework whether they‚Äôre thematized-foregrounded or not. This is a clarification question, not a dispute question (just to be clear!).

		* üüß **[conqueringflesh](https://www.reddit.com/user/conqueringflesh)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 6 _(2024-05-08 14:05:29)_

			Ha! Are there unconscious ontological commitments?
			
			You're on the ball. I suppose I can clarify also by invoking the ontic and ontological distinction, but that would situate the question too much on the side of philosophy (or a kind of philosophy).
			
			Using Lacanian language (would this situate it too much on the side of a kind of Psa?), we can say Psa is concerned with not being, but subjectivity. (In this sense Heidegger is right, 'psychoanalysis glimpses from Dasein only the mode of fallenness,' sub-jectum.) But for Psa being is already already a perversion, a pathological relation of man to subjecthood. Maybe it's better to say Psa is not necessarily non-ontological, but anti-ontological?

			* üü¶ **[vikingsquad](https://www.reddit.com/user/vikingsquad)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2024-05-08 15:03:50)_

				The ontic-ontological language helps, a bit, though my familiarity with Heidegger is limited to people responding to him rather than direct knowledge. It sounds like what you‚Äôre saying is that psychoanalysis is incapable of providing us with an account of the fundamental or transcendental structures-conditions of existence and is only able to yield these through inflected (subjectivated, subjectified, interpellated, etc?) forms and that, for the former, we‚Äôre necessarily turned to philosophy rather than psychoanalysis?

				* üü™ **[conqueringflesh](https://www.reddit.com/user/conqueringflesh)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 3 _(2024-05-08 16:24:51)_

					Not incapable, but seeing it as at best irrelevant, at worst mystifying. Moreover, that there is no meaningful or non-operational distinction between said structures and forms.
					
					
					Sounds a lot like de-construction, ana-lysis, doesn't it? Also like science (in a Feynmanian sense), which ironically was Freud's original project.

* üü© **[rafaelholmberg](https://www.reddit.com/user/rafaelholmberg) (OP)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 7 _(2024-05-08 09:56:52)_

	The breakthrough of the Freudian subject was its irreducibility to established metaphysical and ontological milestones. He unapologetically inverted and twisted established doctrines on (for example) time and negation, much like Oscar Wilde perverted and distorted an English middle-class 'common-sense' wisdom. Yet the break between psychoanalysis and philosophy remains obscure. The formal reasoning utilised by Freud to 'move beyond' philosophy is reproducible within philosophy itself. Philosophy seems to presuppose what is inarticulable for its own discourse. It appears that psychoanalysis is only 'independent' of philosophy insofar as it is constitutively bound to the latter's operations.

	* üü® **[redditaccount001](https://www.reddit.com/user/redditaccount001)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 6 _(2024-05-09 00:29:16)_

		Did he not just say that psychoanalysis is separate from philosophy because he was so staunchly committed to the idea that what he was doing was empirical scientific research?

	Sorry this might be off topic - but most of the bellow comments talk about Freud and his version of psychoanalysis. I‚Äôm a huge Jung and Campbell (and most of other post-Freudian heroes) - does the Jungian framework still derail from philosophy like the Freudian framework does?

	* üü® **[conqueringflesh](https://www.reddit.com/user/conqueringflesh)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 4 _(2024-05-09 09:21:12)_

		As a post-Jungian (post-post-Jungian?), I feel that Jungian analysis 'derails' from philosophy in the other direction - toward religion.

		Jung was deeply read in Western philosophy and his work was profoundly inspired by and in conversation with  various eminent philosophers (including, I think, Nietzsche)... I'd love to hear peoples' insights into Jung's engagement with or contributions to various philosophical traditions!

		How does such strict disciplinarity serve us? While early psychoanalysis and contemporary psychology *do* integrate the more physical aspects of psychology (whether neuroscience specifically or not) it doesn‚Äôt seem to me that they‚Äôre strictly neuroscientific practices much like the social sciences straddle the quantitative methods of science and the more hermeneutic or interpretive strategies of the humanities.

				But this is not true. The medical profession absolutely does not conform to one approach to mapping neuroscience and psychoanalysis, the genetic links between ASD and schizophrenia are tenuous at best, psychoanalysis cannot be said to have simply split from the rest of the medical profession, medicines are not used to treat autism although some people on the spectrum may take anti-depressants or anxiolitics to help with those issues rather than their autism...
				
				Doctors from multiple disciplines working together within an organization - such as a national health system or a large hospital - is not new or an innovation. Medical teamwork has been quite common throughout all of my 50-odd years of life - and illness.
				
				You're just exaggerating, imagining, and bullshitting. Pointless.

								I think it's probably prudent: (1) not to speculate on other people's life experience or relation to ability unless they've specifically made a point of bringing it up, (2) similarly not to presume you know more and subsequently condescend to others based on faulty assumptions mentioned in 1. Please and thank you. This is based in part on your comments in this specific thread and in recent others in the subreddit, for which you were also warned not to speculate on others' fitness or ability. Thanks!
