The **Macy conferences** were a set of meetings of scholars from various [academic disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline "Academic discipline") held in [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") under the direction of [Frank Fremont-Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Fremont-Smith "Frank Fremont-Smith") at the [Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Macy_Jr._Foundation "Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation") starting in 1941 and ending in 1960. The explicit aim of the conferences was to promote meaningful communication across [scientific disciplines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_discipline "Scientific discipline"),<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> and restore unity to science.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> There were different sets of conferences designed to cover specific topics, for a total of 160 conferences over the 19 years this program was active;<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> the phrase "Macy conference" does not apply only to those on [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics"), although it is sometimes used that way informally by those familiar only with that set of events. Disciplinary isolation within [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine") was viewed as particularly problematic by the Macy Foundation, and given that their mandate was to aid medical research, they decided to do something about it.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Thus other topics covered in different sets of conferences included: [aging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging "Aging"), [adrenal cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_cortex "Adrenal cortex"), biological [antioxidants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant "Antioxidant"), [blood clotting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_clotting "Blood clotting"), [blood pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure "Blood pressure"), [connective tissues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue "Connective tissue"), infancy and childhood, [liver injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_injury "Liver injury"), [metabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic "Metabolic") interrelations, [nerve impulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_impulse "Nerve impulse"), problems of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness"), and [renal function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_function "Renal function").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

## Overview\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macy_conferences&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Overview")\]

The Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation developed two innovations specifically designed to encourage and facilitate interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary exchanges; one was oral: the Macy conferences, and one was written: the Macy transactions (published transcriptions of the conferences). Macy conferences were essentially conversations held in a conference setting, with participants presenting research while it was still in process (rather than after it had been completed). These were more formal than conversations (papers were prepared ahead of time and circulated) but less formal than conferences. Macy transactions were transcriptions widely circulated to those who could not attend. These were far more informal than typical proceedings, which publish revised versions of conference papers, and served to invite additional scholars into the exchange. The explicit goal was to let a wider audience hear the experts exchange ideas and think out loud about their own work.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> But even participants themselves found the transactions valuable, as a way to prompt memories, and to catch comments they might have missed.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> A few comments were made explicitly referring to later publication of the conference discussions, so clearly participants took this into account. However, Fremont-Smith explicitly stated that actual discussion should always take priority.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

Participants were leading scientists from a wide range of fields. Casual recollections of several participants as well as published comments in the Transactions volumes stress the communicative difficulties in the beginning of each set of conferences, giving way to the gradual establishment of a common language powerful enough to communicate the intricacies of the various fields of expertise present. Participants were deliberately chosen for their willingness to engage in interdisciplinary conversations, or for having formal training in multiple disciplines, and many brought relevant past experiences (gained either from earlier Macy conferences or other venues). As participants became more secure in their ability to understand one another over the course of a set of conferences on a single topic, their willingness to think outside their own specializations meant that creativity increased.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

### Cybernetics Conferences\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macy_conferences&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Cybernetics Conferences")\]

The Cybernetics conferences were held between 1946 and 1953, organized by the [Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Macy,_Jr._Foundation "Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation"), motivated by [Lawrence K. Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_K._Frank "Lawrence K. Frank") and [Frank Fremont-Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Fremont-Smith "Frank Fremont-Smith") of the Foundation.<sup id="cite_ref-ASC_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-ASC-11">[11]</a></sup> As chair of this set of conferences, [Warren McCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_McCulloch "Warren McCulloch") had responsibility to ensure that disciplinary boundaries were not unduly respected.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> The Cybernetics were particularly complex as a result of bringing together the most diverse group of participants of any of the Macy conferences, so they were the most difficult to organize and maintain.<sup id="cite_ref-Macy_Foundation_1955_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-Macy_Foundation_1955-14">[14]</a></sup>

The principal purpose of these series of conferences was to set the foundations for a _general science of the workings of the human mind_.<sup id="cite_ref-summary_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-summary-15">[15]</a></sup> These were one of the first organized studies of [interdisciplinarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity "Interdisciplinarity"), spawning breakthroughs in [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory "Systems theory"), [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics "Cybernetics"), and what later became known as [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

One of the topics spanning a majority of the conferences was [reflexivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference"). [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon"), one of the attendees, had previously worked on [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory") and laid one of the initial frameworks for the Cybernetic Conferences by postulating [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information") as a probabilistic element which reduced the uncertainty from a set of choices (i.e. being told a statement is true, or even false, completely reduces the ambiguity of its message).

Other conference members, especially [Donald MacKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_MacCrimmon_MacKay "Donald MacCrimmon MacKay"), sought to reconcile Shannon's view of [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information"), which they called selective information, with theirs of ['structural' information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_information_theory "Structural information theory") which signified how selective information was to be understood  (i.e. a true statement might acquire additional meanings in varied settings though the information exchanged itself has not changed). The addition of meaning into the concept of information necessarily brought the role of the observer into the Macy Conferences. MacKay argued that by receiving and interpreting a message, the observer and the information they perceived ceased to exist independently of one another. The individual reading and processing the information does so relative to their preexisting internal state, consisting of what they already know and have experienced, and only then acts.

MacKay further muddled the role of information and its meaning by introducing the idea of [reflexivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference") and feedback loops into his thought experiment. By claiming that the influence of the original message on the initial observer could be perceived by a separate individual, MacKay turned the second individual into an additional observer which could be elicited to react just how the initial observer did, a reaction that could then further be observed by a nested doll of observers _ad infinitum_.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

[Reflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference") feedback loops continued to come up during the Macy Conferences and became a prominent issue during its later discussions as well, most notably in the discussions regarding [behavioral patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern "Behavioral pattern") of the [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind").

[Warren McCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_McCulloch "Warren McCulloch") and [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts "Walter Pitts"), also attendees, had previously worked on designing the first mathematical schema of a [neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron") based on the idea that each [neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron "Artificial neuron") had a threshold level that was to be reached, via excitation signals from incoming neurons, before firing its own [signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal "Signal") onto others. Similarly to how Shannon had previously proven with his work in [relay and switch circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication "A Mathematical Theory of Communication"), McCulloch and Pitts proved that [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network") were capable of carrying out any [boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra "Boolean algebra") calculations.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

At the Macy Conferences, McCulloch proposed that the firing of a [neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron") can be associated with an event or interaction taking place in the external world which provides sensory stimulus that is then picked up by the [nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system "Nervous system") and processed by the [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron"). But McCulloch also showed how a [neural network's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network "Neural network") [signal pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transduction_(physiology) "Transduction (physiology)") could be set up [reflexively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference") with itself causing the neurons to continuously fire onto each other in a 'reverberating' circular [feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback "Feedback") loop without any original 'firing' signal or any new additional incoming signals. McCulloch claimed this accounted for conscious phenomena in which individuals' world view, or the reaffirmation of their senses' perceived external stimulus, was [cognitively distorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion "Cognitive distortion") or all together missing as seen in individuals with [phantom limb syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_limb "Phantom limb") (claiming to feel an arm that has been amputated or lost) or [hallucinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination "Hallucination") (perceived sensory stimulus without an original external signal).<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Lawrence Kubie, another attending conference member and a psychiatrist, noted how repetitive and [obsessive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder "Obsessive–compulsive disorder") behaviors manifesting themselves in [neurotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis "Neurosis") bore a resemblance to the behavior enacted by McCulloch's 'reverberating' loops.

[Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon") had developed a maze-solving device which attendees of the Macy Conferences likened to a rat. Shannon's 'rat' was designed and programmed to find its marked goal when dropped at any point in a maze by giving it the ability to recall on past experiences, previous paths it had taken around the maze, so as to help it reach its endpoint - which it did repeatedly.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

Though goal-oriented, Shannon showed how his rat's design was prone to erratic behavior that negated its original function entirely via [reflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference") [feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback "Feedback") loops. If Shannon's rat encountered itself in a path in which its 'memory' failed to fire correctly, that is to recall the paths which lead it to its goal, it would get stuck in an endless loop chasing its tail.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Completely abandoning its goal-oriented design, Shannon's rat had seemingly become neurotic.

The Macy Conferences failed to reconcile the subjectivity of information (its meaning) and that of the human mind but succeeding in showing how concepts such as that of the observer, [reflexivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference"), [black box systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box "Black box"), and [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network "Neural network") would have to be approached in conjunction and eventually overcome in order to form a complete working theory of the mind.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> The Macy Conferences were discontinued shortly after the ninth conference.

Five annual Neuropharmacological Conferences took place from 1954 to 1959 with a skipped year in 1958.

### Group Processes Conferences\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Macy_conferences&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Group Processes Conferences")\]

The Group Processes Conferences were held between 1954 and 1960. They are of particular interest due to the element of reflexivity: participants were interested in their own functioning as a group, and made numerous comments about their understanding of how Macy conferences were designed to work. For example, there were a series of jokes made about the disease afflicting them all, interdisciplinitis,<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> or how multidisciplinarian researchers were neither fish nor fowl.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> When [Erving Goffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erving_Goffman "Erving Goffman") made a guest appearance at the Third conference, he explicitly prefaced his comments by saying that his ideas were partly speculative, and [Frank Fremont-Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Fremont-Smith "Frank Fremont-Smith") responded by stating that their goal was to discuss ideas that had not been crystallized.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy_conferences#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>
