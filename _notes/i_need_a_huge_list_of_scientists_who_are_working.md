## I need a huge list of scientists who are working on idealism, like Don Hoffman?

	Ian McGilchrist, Bernard Carr, and the Qualia Research Institute are those I'm familiar with. Bernardo has also come up with tentative conceptual models of dissociation himself, using graph theory. You can find those in his papers.

			Robert Lanza has proposed his version of mental reality theory - Biocentrism, at least two books out.
			
			Kastrup puts some of his theory out in the book The Idea of the World.
			
			Some of those scientists are working with Kastrup and can be found at the website for this theory. That webdsite is called T[he Essentia Foundation](https://www.essentiafoundation.org/).
			
			The other scientists are working as group, or as affiliate scientists, on a mental reality theory at their website, [Quantum Gravity Research](https://quantumgravityresearch.org/).

		Whose work is closer to AI?       Do you know AI scientists who harness AI  to support idealism research?

			What does AI have to do with idealism?

				Cognitive science/computational neuroscience use AI techniques. And Idealism can be supported by cognitive science/computational neuroscience.
