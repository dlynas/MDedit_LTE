	There’s a video essay detailing their political structure called Neighborhood councils of Rojova ( a method I’m societal self direction) bu the YouTube channel neighborhood democracy.  There’s also the road to Raqqa which is about the Kurdish women defeating Isis.

	There's a documentary 'Roza, between two rivers' about the system of Rojava. Also, maybe you haven't seen it yet, there's a documentary on Rojava called 'Commander Arian' which you can watch here: https://vimeo.com/330853056?ref=fb-share

	There's also this link to the book Stateless Democracy: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=47&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjXn-_ktMroAhXEyKQKHfQPC-I4KBAWMAZ6BAgIEAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jonasstaal.nl%2Fsite%2Fassets%2Ffiles%2F1180%2Fnwa5_stateless_democracy.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MCDUOIuEECXfzcrSn2qis
