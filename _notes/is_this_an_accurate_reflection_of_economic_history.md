	No.  I say this after reading The Dawn of Everything where the authors go to massive lengths to state this teleology and “progressions” of it are wrong.  History, especially economic, does not move in such easy, linear modalities but if this is easier for you to understand than use it! 

	Feel free to check out the book; it will state why this line of questioning is not helpful and will show why, as well as better ways to have this discussion.

		However, I recommend readers to be critical, I remember from r/AskHistorians that sometimes David wrote the opposite of the sources he used for his claims. Like, for example, one time he had [claimed that most Indian captives assimilated into Native American society and did not want to return.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wnwvlb/comment/ikk30ok/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)

			Sure. That stat only discusses New England captives but that is a small detail of the book that they do say but hardly a major theme of the book.  That is the standard for historians (to nitpick at inaccuracies), I would know as I am one but the book overall was desperate needed in many respects that really don’t have to do with this inaccuracy.

	No.

	Feudalism in the sense of a distinctive form of economic organisation looks to have never actually existed. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/s/Sot4quJXBP

	"Mercantilism" was Adam Smith's name for a bunch of economic policy ideas around his time that he grouped together and criticised (devastatingly criticised, in my opinion).  Many of those ideas are however still popular today. 

	"Communist economy": all self-declared socialist countries attempts at centrally planned economies wound up with something with a fair degree of market activity, of varying degrees of legality (see the USSR for an example) or basically collapsed (Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge).

		Mercantilism was mainly a French and British idea. They believed that society's wealth came from accumulating gold. So they wanted to encourage the accumulation of it while ensuring that the exports to other countries increase, thereby increasing gold deposits. This is similar to the protectionist policies or the ISI policies of the 60s and 70s.

						So the idea was discussed first in British and French courts. It was also called the Dutch puzzle. While I don't know if the idea had it's inception in the Netherlands but the earliest evidence of there being a discussion around this seemed to be from Britain and France. The main conclusion was that the Dutch could do so by maintaining a positive balance of trade. That to me gave birth to the idea of mercantilism. It was of course followed by passing of statutes or the equivalent of it in the British and French courts. I would be happy to hear if there are alternative views on this. Thanks:)

	Thats not a progression as much as it is a taxonomy or list of important terms...an incomplete one at that. Many of these overlap. Agrarian economies frequently mixed slavery and gift giving, as did hunter-gatherers before we domesticated animals.

	Its not even all that extensive. Take for example the rule of Chingis Khan. Where do the nomads in central asia fit in that grouping? The came in and dominated a large swathe of agricultural/fuedal economies, but not for very long. This is exactly why you can't take such a linear view of history.

	The idea of linear progression is a myth made up by communism to say that everything becoming what they want is inevitable.

	Different places had different economies going back and forth constantly. 

	That and trying to predict the future is usually a losing proposition

		Historicism is older than Marxism and was common among Enlightenment and especially German scholars in the 17th and 18th centuries. There's actually really a reason Marx picked up on it in the first place: his whole theory of history is an inversion of Hegelian dialectical history, which was a historicist theory of historical progression towards a final world spirit. It was in the water for a guy like Marx, so it found its way into communism as an ideology.

			More accurately, Marx was deeply influenced by Hegel's work. Still, he inverted the dialectic materialistically - whereas he saw economic and material forces as primarily shaping historical progress rather than the ideas or spirit of Hegel. However, he retained Hegel's dialectical, progressive sense of history which is how it got into Marxism.

			* 🟦 **[Mexatt](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mexatt)** ⬆️ 4 _(2023-11-23 20:10:03)_

				This is a repetition of what I said, so I don't know about 'more accurately'. Hegel was an idealist, Marx was a materialist, but they both had the sense of dialectical historicism.

				* 🟪 **[Rear-gunner](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rear-gunner)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-11-23 21:03:31)_

					Marx did not simply pick up on historicism. His dialectical historicism is very different to Hegel.

			* 🟦 **[idareet60](https://www.reddit.com/user/idareet60)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-11-24 01:30:28)_

				Yes, and I'd say the biggest contribution of Marx is the idea of conflicts that makes a society grow. Economic forces but these forces are inherently class driven.

				* 🟪 **[Rear-gunner](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rear-gunner)** ⬆️ 0 _(2023-11-24 10:58:25)_

					An associate of Marx, Moses Hess  challenged class as the major force.  Hess argued religious and cultural factors also played important roles. This shows Marx's theory was not universally accepted even among  fellow socialists/communists much less the rest of us.

					* 🟥 **[idareet60](https://www.reddit.com/user/idareet60)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-11-24 11:05:42)_

						Yes. There could be criticism of it of course. I merely stated that class was an important distinction.

								Hehe there are criticisms. But I am just saying that the historical dialectics play out through class dynamics in Marx. And class struggle is the driving force for social change. While Hegel had at it's heart the realization of ideas and class was in the background not the forefront.

								* ⬜️ **[Rear-gunner](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rear-gunner)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-11-24 19:29:08)_

									The fact it exists in Marxism does not mean it's  the cause in reality.

* 🟩 **[the__truthguy](https://www.reddit.com/user/the__truthguy)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-11-24 01:11:12)_

	According to Marx and Engels there is this "natural" progression and stages of economic development. 

	I don't agree with that view. In my opinion economies are a complex mix of genetic traits, technology, resources, and politics. It is true that certain technologies make certain economies likely, but it's obviously more complicated.

	* 🟨 **[idareet60](https://www.reddit.com/user/idareet60)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-11-24 01:34:50)_

		Actually Marx doesn't have a natural progression. It all depends on the institutions that support the existing class structure. In the manifesto he seems to have this deterministic view of societal progress but it was in fact Smith who has some of this deterministic belief rather than Marx. Smith believes through his hub and spoke model that through efficiency gains and people specializing in some methods of production we will see a rise in a 'capitalist' society. But production will always become more efficient and it'll never become less efficient.

	Very cursory treatment, no sources, not much discussion. The Wikipedia entry  

	[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic\_history\_of\_the\_world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_world)

	covers the same topic better. Its still not great, but its better than the Wikibooks entry, with at least some good sources.

	Generally, for any tertiary analyses like this (eg its not a primary source, its not even a secondary source, it appears to drawn from secondary sources) . . . giving references is essential.  

	**No references = pointless**

	The concept of progress in history is a result of the Christian conceptualization of reality. There is no line toward anything.
