## UPDATE 11/17/23: eSIMs have been confirmed to work only in some areas amidst communications blackout. 

Wonderful work from @mirna_elhelbawi around #ConnectingGaza and pulling this all together. And thank you to @bintmeetsworld for creating the slides!

1. Download one of these eSIM charging apps: Holafly, Nomad, Simly, Airolo 
2. Choose the location and number of GB you want to purchase. I’ve heared from multiple sources that over 30GB is great, but any amount is helpful 
3. Email a clear image of the QR code (not the link, but the QR code itself) to gazaesims@gmail.com and the @connectinghumanity_ team will distribute to folks in need on the ground in Palestine

"Sending an E-SIM to Palestine is one way to help Palestinians stay connected.
A few folks ask me what an E-SIM was, so just to explain, it's not a physical card,
like some phones have, but it's technology embedded in most modern phones that allows you to
switch providers and connect to different towers and services without the need of swapping out
physical cards. So by providing an E-SIM, you're essentially giving away for pre-paid text calls and
data to happen for essential communication. Egyptian writer and journalist Mirna Ehabewe started
a nonprofit organization called Connecting Humanity and their first missing is called Connecting Gaza.
And this all started because requests started coming in as she thought about ways she could help
and she started getting hundreds and thousands of requests. At first, she was trying to get E-SIMs to
journalists as well as healthcare providers, but she's expanded into everyone who needs one on the
ground. And she now has a team of folks who are helping her do this, distributing as well as
communicating with folks. And in the past two weeks, they've gotten over 600,000 US dollars worth
of donations for E-SIM cards and they've been able to activate at least 11,000 E-SIMs. So let's go
through how you can contribute an E-SIM to Palestine. Download one of these four apps. These four
allow you to provide E-SIMs to the occupied territories. In the app, you want to choose a location
of service as well as how many gigabytes you want to contribute. Now, unfortunately, when you choose
a location under a couple of these apps, you have to choose a name Israel, but just know that that is
a temporary colonizer name for what we know as Palestine. I've read from different sources that
sending over 30 is a good number, but whatever amount you contribute is welcome and received.
When you finish your payment, you will get a QR code. You want to email that QR code to only this
email address here. Make sure the QR code is fully in the image that it is clear that you're not
sending a link of the QR code, but you're sending the image of the QR code itself and then it's
not an already used one. Once you email it to that address, Mier and I and her team will make sure
that it gets distributed to folks on the ground who need it. Those apps even allow you to check on
the QR code to see if it's been activated. This is an example of screenshot of an activated
eSIM that was sent and activated in Palestine. Mier and I and her team have been super transparent
about how they've been distributing the eSIM. And she continues to post updates on Twitter,
X, and Instagram. So in addition to calling, texting, emailing, your representative constantly
attending protests, supporting protesters, sharing information about Palestine. This is just one
of the many things you can do to support Palestinians."
