And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes too near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness.

	"Did you know that on a biological level, you are nothing of the same person you were since you were born, or even a few years ago? Your cells die off and are being held together by a constant cycle of death and the birth of new cells, making up your body in a way where you can never tell the difference over any given day. But you are changing, and every human is the living embodiment of theseus's ship. And what that means is that regardless of who you were in the past, more than likely, and if you're succeeding at life, you've changed. Becoming older, living day by day, all that means moving on to becoming someone new, both physically, mentally, spiritually, and biologically. You literally can't expect your identity to be the same your whole life. A great example is if you were a picky eater at a child. Can you imagine just how little you'd eat at any time if you made that your identity? And attempted to hold onto it your whole life? Your life wouldn't have so much less richness and diversity to it, so little flavors and chances for new experiences... and just as a picky eater eventually learns to step outside of their comfort zone to find a new realm of amazing possibilities in food, we do this every day as we move forward to grow and become whole human beings who experience life on a grander scale than before."

	The plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers, and lovers of every kind. It needs people who live well in their places. It needs people of moral courage willing to join the fight to make the world habitable and humane. And these qualities have little to do with success as we have defined it

	This is the right time and I will risk everything because if I don't, we've lost. We march to victory, or we march to defeat. But we go forward. Only forward. Stannis the mannis

	This has helped me get over giving up if things are too difficult I tend to give up easily. And the resolve in this has helped me try harder
