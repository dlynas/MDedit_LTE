Germany's defense of Israel in the name of the holocaust is a striking example of what happens when history is taught with a focus on events and outcomes rather than processes. The same thing happens in the U.S. a  1/



Teaching history as events, as I was taught in grade school, and as I think a lot of people are taught, means that we isolate the actors as exceptional. Eg bad Germans mass murdered Jewish people. 2/

This precludes an understanding of structure eg the rise of fascism, how one group of people can systematically dehumanize another, how state brutality takes hold, and how it can become acceptable to systematically murder people; to commit genocide. 3/

In the United States we also see this in discourse around race. Enslavement becomes about bad whites, rather than a story of exploitation, colonialism, and white supremacy. Jim Crow becomes about a bad law, rather than an attempt to systematically disenfranchise people. 4/

From this vantage people claim that racism is over because the insitution of "enslavement" that they learned about or "Jim Crow" don't exist. Because they didn't learn that it was always about white supremacy and power. 5/

This is one reason why we need to teach the social sciences in schools. Because muting process means repeating it, with different proper nouns. Even in the name of rectifying past wrongs. 6/

I'm just starting to learn about colonialism and how it foreshadowed the Nazis. I'm horrified by the patterns that exist and how history repeats itself. I never learned anything about that.

Yes! its' wild. Teaching on that this week!

Did you see this thread? Speaks to your points.

There's something hard for us, children of the colonised, to articulate because the world is upside down. Europe and its descendants, can't differentiate between principle and episode. This is why Germany (and much of Europe) is doomed to be genocidal. Here is what I mean. 

While teaching the Nürnberg Trials here in Germany I had a supervisor in the classroom who, after me explaining institutional racism, told me I could not talk badly of the police... why does he think we learn about the Holocaust?

And what is the ultimate lesson, we should forfeit our wealth, prosperity, privilege & power because they are built on crimes?

It's also an example of when history (or any subject) is looked at in almost solely moralistic terms (the explanation loses much of its power because it's so tied up in judgment\[s\]).

And when the system of nation-states designed to produce and legitimize genocides is left intact and unquestioned…

Are there texts you'd recommend that take this approach to history?

slightly related my great-gran would get furious if someone brought up the Holocaust with no mention of nazi germany's 5-20m other victims (overt & other) she was ~13 when nazis put her in a forced labor camp digging graves she'd be so pissed @ germany today (awake ~62h ope sry)

Do they teach German children about Namibia in Germany's pantheon of genocides?

A good explanation of what's gone wrong in Germany. Despite the devastation, the defeat plus the info that emerged, post war, 30-40% of Germans agreed with core Nazi dogma. And 70% felt the public weren't responsible. Elites were the most resistant to denazification! 

The purpose of education is not to indoctrinate youth into an activist ideology that views the world in terms of power structures. At one time, even the social sciences remained rigorous; they were about studying human beings in a morally relative and dispassionate way...
