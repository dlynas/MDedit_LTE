What is ownership? The answer seems obvious, until you think about it. How is it possible for one person to ‘own’ a piece of earth? In truth, ownership is a thing we make up. It is a piece of paper. It is power. It is an invisible agreement, that shapes our lives, our landscapes, our economy and our society. It is the single largest form of wealth on the planet. It also underpins almost all of the crises we face today, from inequality to climate change.

But other forms of ownership are possible. In fact, they are already here. Many have been around for millennia. And right now, all around the world, communities and countries are designing new, fairer ways to own and steward land and buildings – and reviving ancient ones.

Redesigning ownership is crucial for humanity’s future. And the solutions are already here – we just need to understand them.

_“The ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently” – David Graeber_
