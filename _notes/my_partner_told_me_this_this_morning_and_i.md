## My Partner told me this this morning and I thought it would be helpful for someone else and wanted to share it.

> He’s pretty amazing on a regular basis, but said something so devastatingly clever today I wanted to share it. 
> 
> I was apologizing because I feel like a burden that I’m still dealing with Trauma/PTSD stuff and that I feel guilty that sometimes it affects my ability to be the partner I’d like to be and I start to feel like a burden.
> 
> He compared it to me trying to carry heavy baggage by myself. I’m always carrying it so to me it’s more noticeable and upsetting. 
> 
> Other people helping is like offering to hold something for me, or letting me know it’s okay to put something down. 
> 
> It’s not a burden because they aren’t offering to take something on unless they know they’re capable of handling it. It isn’t forced on them like it was on me.
> 
> And when I say I’m not up for something, it’s like, “Well, obviously! Look how many bags you’re trying to carry.” 
> 
> If I need a break to just not have to interact and/or rest, that makes perfect sense too, since I’m having to carry this heavy ass baggage around all the time.

	It is of the highest significance to me that in this universe, I *do* have extra, invisible baggage; *and* it is specifically extra-upsetting and a burden to *only* me; *and* that that still doesn’t make me a wuss or mean that the struggle is *my* fault.  Thanks for writing

	I think I'm still a burden because I keep selfishly asking if someone else can hold what I'm carrying when everyone is already carrying so much already

		Asking for help isn't selfish.
