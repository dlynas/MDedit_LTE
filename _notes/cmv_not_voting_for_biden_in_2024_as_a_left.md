## CMV: Not voting for Biden in 2024 as a left leaning person is bad political calculus

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1858lk8/cmv_not_voting_for_biden_in_2024_as_a_left/](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1858lk8/cmv_not_voting_for_biden_in_2024_as_a_left/)

> Biden's handling of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflicts has encouraged many left-leaning people to affirm that they won't be voting for him in the general election in 2024. Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates. It behooves anyone interested in either making positive change and/or preventing greater harm to vote for the candidate who is more aligned with their policy interests, lest they cede that opportunity to influence the outcome of the election positively.
> 
> Federal policy, namely in regards for foreign affairs, is directly shaped by the executive, of which this vote will be highly consequential. There's strong reason to believe Trump would be far less sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden, ergo if this is an issue you're passionate about, Biden stands to better represent your interest.
> 
> To change my view, I would need some competing understanding of electoral politics or the candidates that could produce a calculus to how not voting for Biden could lead to a preferable outcome from a left leaning perspective. To clarify, I am talking about the general election and not a primary. Frankly you can go ham in the primary, godspeed.
> 
> To assist, while I wouldn't dismiss anything outright, the following points are ones I would have a really hard time buying into:
> 
> - Accelerationism
> - Both parties are the same or insufficiently different
> - Third parties are viable in the general election
> 
> EDIT: To clarify, I have no issue with people threatening to not vote, as I think there is political calculus there. What I take issue with is the act of not voting itself, which is what I assume many people will happily follow through on. I want to understand their calculus at that juncture, not the threat beforehand.

	So the issue here is the 3 positions you list at the end of your post. "Accelerationism" or parties being "tge same" is a popular strawman coming from a position of ignorance.

	The point, which can be discussed at length, is that centrists like Biden and their failures directly lead to far-right popularity. This phenomenon has been studied exhaustively.

	Now if you're talking exclusively voting strategy, the left does not subscribe to your theory of change. The left fundamentally wants to end the current system before the current system inevitably leads to catastrophe and understands that voting, or acting within the system, cannot work to that end. The left believes, and I think with good authority, that a figure like Trump is an inevitable product of the political and economic system as currently practiced and voting for a Biden does nothing to really solve that problem.

		In response to the third paragraph, which could be summarized as the “revolution, not reform” mantra used by the left:
		
		Why does anyone think a revolution/collapse of state would benefit the left? The country is not even close to being primed for a leftist revolution. 
		
		What does the left have to counter the media machines, professional networks, financial capital, etc of the right? How can the left, disorganized as they are, believe they are in a better position than capital to take advantage of the collapse of the state?
		
		I honestly believe that the whole “revolution” framing is right wing propaganda, meant to foment political apathy and have leftists waiting for a day that will never come. 
		
		Seems to me the best path would be to keep implementing leftist policies at local levels, so that eventually a charismatic leftist candidate will have something to stand on at a national level. There’s no leftist revolution without leftist ideas in our national political discourse

			A leftist revolution in our country is so absurd. If you take a look around you and really consider who in this country is most capable of revolution, you would quickly realize it's armed militias, former military and police force, all of which skew rightward in their politics. Leftists by and large are not capable of leading revolution in this country, and to deliberately act to vote in a way you think would foment revolution is only going to destroy the left.

			The leftists not voting Biden are doing so to say "be more progressive if you want us to vote for you. Stay centrist and we won't"

		So, that would make sense both if you lived in a fantasy land and also if you knew no history, and also if you ignored the probabal consequences of a Trump victory in 2024
		
		It's like, basically, there are democratic governments and nondemocratic governments, you can draw the line fine or less fine, but that's the basic distinction. 
		
		Trump attempted a coup once already, it's a attempted coup  by any reasonable definition. So, as a person there are two choices in 24 if Trump gets the nomination, Trump= another coup attempt and Biden equals "not that." 
		
		Now, I'm no leftist, thank god for small favors, but it occurs to me that since 1788 we've made a lot of Democratic progress in this country, I'm saying progress that only happened because people could vote, and pollititions wanted to keep their jobs. So I'm talking everything from the income tax, to the eight hour day to ending slavery to lgbtq rights to women being granted, or getting the vote, to, oh seatbelt laws, highway funding, the list is literally everything we've done. Because if Trump successfully implements a coup, there is no more democracy, and that leaves every leftist in the same position as every other person who has a political ideology seprate from Donald Trump, namely fucked. So, if your argument is "as a leftist, democracy is not the path that gets us what we want, so fuck it, we're out," well, ok, fine, you're out, seeya, skin deep commitment to the American project, fine, fine. 
		
		If there is no democracy, you'll still, as a leftist, experience most of what you do now, as in, you won't get any of what you want, except now, you'll get shot or imprisoned, too. Whereas, like, if Biden wins, that's pulling the entire conversation to the left, you'd have 16 out of 20 years where the President was closer to you people then any of the realistic alternatives, and you're in a democracy where your positions, however popular in taylored polls, don't have the votes, in any capasity to make the things you want law, tough shit, every person in the country feels that way, and we're not like, asking for a coup, which is exactly what an informed person not voting Biden in 2024 is doing, like, if you don't vote Biden next year, you might as well just put a Red Maga cap on and get a Trump sign for your yard, same fucking difference.

			It isn't even that he'll likely do what he did in 2020 (or more likely, worse). Project 2025 is fucking terrifying. It's a playbook to stack the government with far-right political patsies so that, whatever happens afterwards, any attempt to claw us back to *where we are now* will be an uphill battle.  
			
			Bad scenario, Trump wins and tries to stay in power or significantly alters the political, judicial and legal rights and expectations we have now. Worse scenario, all of that and now many government employees (not just appointees) are in on it.

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-11-29 19:40:43)_

				I mean, he's going to literally attempt a coup, to alter the form of government. Look, there are lots of people I disagree with, to my left, and to my right, but right now, I'm at the point where everybody against Trump for the reason that they think he's a threat to our democracy, I am with those people, I don't give a damn what they think about anything else, as long as they think the way we settle our differences is with elections and congress and all of that stuff that's served us well for 230 years. My goal is to get back to a point where I ccan disagree with people about taxe and abortion and gay rights and immigration and if we should build high speed trains, or if we should do this, or that, instead of disagreeing with people about Trump who is nothing but treason walking. Trump is a second attempted coup, that's the worst thing I can imagine for this country.

		I'd appreciate you diving deeper on this then. I don't necessarily disagree with the idea that Trump is the result of a systemic failure, or that action outside of an electoral system is necessary for change. Where I disagree or don't understand is how, in the immediate term, not voting for the candidate who demonstrably would do the country far better from a left perspective than Trump would serve either of those ends, or how they're mutually exclusive.

			Cynically, it could be that they believe the mass misery another Trump term would entail would make more people disenfranchised with the current system, thus increasing the number of people calling for change and, potentially, coming closer to actual revolutionary change.
			
			I would also add though, that there's an intangible "something" that a lot on the left feel when politicians assume they are entitled to our vote simply because the other guy sucks. Its always presented in a way that takes away our agency - "you HAVE to vote for this guy or you're literally enabling Satan" - rather than in a way that actually tries to convince us that the person is worth our vote. And I dunno about you, but I hate being denied even the SEMBLANCE of free choice in who I vote for.

			* 🟦 **[beingsubmitted](https://www.reddit.com/user/beingsubmitted)** ⬆️ 57 _(2023-11-27 16:34:03)_

				I don't think anyone is trying to take away your agency, they just view voting through a different lens. You see it as choosing a destination: "do i want to go to mcdonalds, or panera bread". They see it like steering: "do I want to pull the steering wheel to the left or to the right?". From the first perspective, if neither mcdonalds or panera bread sound awesome, why not choose neither? From their perspective, you're careening into oncoming traffic please god pull the steering wheel before people die.
				
				The thing is, I agree with the steering perspective. When one side of the political spectrum is successful, the "new center" tends to move with it. Reagan was wildly successful electorally, and it pulled the overton window right. The reasons here are pretty simple. One feature of the two party system is that the two options need to be able to distinguish themselves from one another. If you have an extreme right candidate, a moderate right candidate is distinguished enough, while securing the entire vote from the moderate right to the furthest left. When reagan won by such wide margins, the left moved right to broaden their prospects. If democrats start winning by larger margins, the right will start moving back to the center, broadening their base, until it's about evenly matched again. As they do so, the democrats move further and further left to distinguish themselves and, again like republicans today, because they become more fearful of primary challengers than their general opponents.
				
				Now, there is wisdom for politicians to pursue disaffected voters on either side, but there's also a lot of risk - particularly if those voters demand perfection. Your perfect candidate that believes exactly what you believe is probably literally no one elses perfect candidate. But this isn't about what I think politicians should do. I'm talking about what voters ought to do in order to get to where they're going, which is steer. Steer now, then steer again and continue steering until you're there.  
				
				
				Finally... Literally no one deserves to be the president of the united states. That is an absurd amount of power that no one has ever or will ever deserve, including George Washington himself. But, it's a role that's necessary, so someone is put there to serve temporarily. The other issue I take with the "earn my vote" narrative is that it positions the presidency as a reward we give people. It's not that. No one deserves it and no one can ever earn it. They can be entrusted with it, temporarily, as a matter of necessity and as a vehicle for democratic governance.

					Point is very well taken. I agree with the logic you presented, at least for the most part, but I do think the natural rebound of the Overton window you're talking about is far from a given - you can also have the window dragged wider and wider, giving voice to the poles and effectively abandoning everyone in between the extremes.
					
					My perspective is perhaps different because I don't come from a two-party context, and I get that I'm kinda comparing apples and oranges here since this veered entirely into the Trump/Biden cesspool rather than my original leftist voter perspective writ large.
					
					In Canada we get told time and again that we HAVE to vote Liberal or the Conservatives will win, despite having several parties to vote for. People try and raise the spectre of a Conservative government to argue that I CAN'T vote for the NDP, who I mostly agree with, because I'd be enabling the election of the Conservatives. That's where I'm coming from here - being shoehorned into a two-party mentality when that isn't actually reality.
					
					And I know for a fact that a lot of my American friends feel the same when it comes to your elections. That's my context and my point.

					No one deserves to be President of the United States, but all but one of them stepped down from office without violence. Next time, maybe the violence works. George Washington wasn't perfect by a long shot, a very long shot, but he was the first person to step down after his term was up, and we has an unbroken chain until one man deliberately whipped up a mob, then aided it by keeping aid from reaching the Capitol. People who would rather Biden lose because he had a bad take on the Isreal-Palestine conflict have no idea of the bloodshed that would have happened had Trump won, or the bloodshed he'll unleash if he gets back into office. I don't always agree with Biden, but I'm dammed glad he is in office.

					I agree it isn't likely to work. I definitely don't believe it would in an American context.
					
					I also fundamentally believe that it's dangerous to make things worse in the hopes of gaining more followers. That's how terrorist organizations function, for one, but also history shows that the conditions lead to dictators taking power. Lenin is a good example, so are the Nazis, and the Italian Fascists.

						To me, left accelerationism is like an emergency hope/last ditch failsafe if we can't prevent a far right executive/system.  It *might* work, but it's better not to have to rely on it. It's like that old idea about punching a shark in the nose ( or, according to experts, it's better to retaliate by attacking the gills or eyes. ) It absolutely might work, but by then we're already badly injured and in danger. Much better to avoid the shark attack in the first place.

							We could jump down several rabbit holes here as well, cause you're brushing right up against the difference between incrementalism and revolution.
							
							I think the only thing I'd add, is that this is something the centre HAS to be aware of. They used to be able to take leftist votes for granted, but more and more of us have seen the Overton window shift to the point we can't conscience the status quo anymore. There needs to be a concerted push by mainstream politics to shift the window left again - and if it won't happen organically, I fear the Left will let accelerationism shift the window for us.

								Even though I'm "blue no matter who" what I would say to the DNC if I had their undivided attention would make my harshest criticism of left wing Jill Stein voter types sound like the sweetest lullaby by comparison. The Democratic party is barely hanging on against the GOP, which is a sad party of obsolete culture warriors, grifters and morons at this point. The Democratic party needs a big inspirational agenda, a New New Deal and we need to urgently moderate on Gaza because, if we lose the election because of it, Trump will do even worse to Gaza in addition to fucking everything up domestically.

						So what do you believe the continuation would have been?   More protests?   
						 Would the protests get more violent?  Trump has already said he will declare martial law to fight protesters if he wins in 2024.  There were people in his cabinet who wanted to go out and kill protesters during George Floyd. at the White House.  There is a weapon that puts out a sound that incapacitates people, often leaving them with permanent hearing loss. Those weapons were deployed at the White House.  We were one or two sane generals away from using them in American citizens. 
						
						If you think we will have another Kent State, people will see some dead protesters and take heed, like they did 60 years ago, you're naive to be nice. BTW, while it changed opinions on the war Nixon won in a landslide at the next election.
						
						So I'll ask you.  If Trump wins, he calls out the National Guard, they kill a few protesters.  more people go out to protest,  that Trump and his people will back down, citizens will start moving left or he will kill or jail more protesters. Have curfews, close colleges,  you get the idea.  Look, I get that things aren't good, they can get much worse very quickly.

								Or maybe, just maybe, the majority of even Democrats don't see it as dire as you do?   
								
								Look at the 2020 primaries.  Early on Bernie did well. Then the primaries went to the Midwest and South.  Biden did really well because a lot of the people voting want it better, not blown up.  They aren't conservative, but more conservative than what Bernie wants.  They see problems, but are conservative, they have been around long enough to know that while some type of universal healthcare, would be good. but understand that we aren't just overturning 20% of GDP.  They were around long enough to know that while Obamacare isn't a solution it is miles better than what we had before.

							During the BLM protests, every time the cops got more violent, more protesters showed up.
							
							When the cops started leaving them alone they petered out.
							
							Portland VS Los Angeles is a great example of this. 
							
							So yeah, declaring martial law and shooting protesters would probably make protestors more violent. If cops are showing restraint, doing violence is an insane risk. If simply standing around holding signs is routinely getting people shot, there's no longer any reason not to be violent.
							
							I'm not personally jumping on the accelerationist train, but the government cracking down harder often results in stronger pushback. The obvious down side is the potential civil war and millions of dead people.
							
							It was being nice to the moderate left while at the same time being very not nice to the extreme left that prevented revolution in the new deal era. Gunning down protesters is the opposite of that.
							
							China did the same thing after tiananmem, big changes that fixed a lot of what people were unhappy about.
							
							The US had more guns than people, there's 2 varieties of explosives you can just buy, and the war in Ukraine has been a master class on how to weaponize commercial drones. Controlling the US by pure force might be possible, but doing so would be a bloody mess.

								Right, and are things really so bad that it is time to shed blood?  You talk about how Ukraine is doing it, but 14000 Ukrainians have been killed. 
								
								There is a weapon.  It emits a sound so piercing that people drop where they are, it often results in hearing damage. One can drop a field of people.   They were deployed in front of the White House during the protests (but not used.) 
								
								You understand that if Trump wins, declares martial law, they won't be a little rough, they will be shooting violent people.   You can tell me that the protesters will arm themselves so we will see, but OMG, is it that bad?   
								
								Things like this are cyclical.   I graduated when the was a recession, people weren't hiring.  inflation was high and interest rates were over 12%.   But you are ready to shed blood because the country doesn't work the way you think it should?

							Again, that's assuming the goals of the BLM movement were to get a certain president elected.  What I saw specifically in that movement were many white liberals and centrists finding an outlet for their disgust with Trump. They were never really committed to the ideals of reform or abolition, and they generally abandoned the mass movement once Biden was elected.  That being said, there were some minor systemic changes that took effect because of the BLM movement and its influence that go beyond which person is elected head of the Democratic party.

				This sounds like the standard accelerationism argument, so my counter claims would be:
				
				1) Another Trump presidency could very well be the last presidency. I would much rather fight for change without having to overthrow a dictatorial power atop the backs of the potential millions of dead it would take to do that.
				
				2) Why are we assuming that there's enough political energy for this supposed revolutionary goal? If there's energy for revolutionary change, why not do it now? Are people just stupid? Those are not the people I would entrust a revolution to.
				
				What I would ultimately need reconciled is how participating within an electoral system is mutually exclusive with the change you're proposing. It sounds like none of this requires ceding ground and power to an incredibly dangerous adversary. Why make it harder?

					I can't really answer your second point. It's not a view to which I ascribe - simply one with which I'm familiar. I guess the answer could be that as things get worse more people will jump on the anti-establishment bandwagon and, over time, it'll reach a critical mass. I do agree that I wouldn't trust those folks with leading a revolution.
					
					To your first point though, I want to be clear that I agree with you. If I was an American, I'd be voting against Trump 100% of the time because I do think the threat warrants the "end of democracy" rhetoric, and I also agree with your point about making things harder on ourselves.
					
					The problem, though, is that the left in the US has been told for at LEAST two decades that they have to vote for the Democrat otherwise it'll be the end of the world. After crying wolf for so long, can you really blame people for being fed up and ignoring it?

						I think the unfortunate issue is that whatever is radicalizing the right to support someone like Trump is self perpetuating on part of the conservative party. The only way I see that issue resolving itself short of a revolution is an implosion within the GOP, the latter of which looks increasingly likely. The country writ large is pretty conservative, I don't see strong evidence for any untapped progressive potential, at least not potential that could be realized before 2024.

							As someone who is conservative myself and several of my family are open MAGA supporters, maybe my 2 cents will help one of your questions. "Whatever is radicalizing the right to support someone like Donald Trump".
							
							IMO it's more or less the same thing that has "radicalized the left".  People feeling more and more fucked by the current system.  Common sentiments such as "Clinton screwed up people buying homes with Fanny Mae" "Bush and the never ending lies/ wars/ Patriot Act". "Obama with Obamacare screwing people cause jobs only hiring for 32/h max so they don't have to pay insurance". "College only got expensive when the government got involved".
							
							The rhetoric and the reasons actually are amazing similar for anyone who lived it.  It boils down to "Leftists thinks the government can fix it / Right-wing thinks the government only makes it worse".

								Appreciate the comments, and I agree with the big picture point of people’s “feels”. But this reinforces the “uniformed voter” discussion. Example: schools became more expensive when governments STOPPED funding them and colleges kept adding junk to get more attendance. Obamacare gave insurance (expensive) and most importantly gave a set of rights. Corporations decided to be capitalists over humans, and now democrats are trying to make the gig economy fair. Again I’m not saying it is gravy, but it isn’t based on facts. The feels imo are based on our system of “unresponsive representation”.

			I wish I could but I'm getting off my lunch break here in a minute so I'll say what I can and leave the rest to others much smarter than I am:
			
			So there is the point that centrist governments in the past have ultimately lead to far-right success, and I can happily provide sources and further reading:
			
			Robert Caro's Path To Power (specifically volume 1, which goes in depth into the politics of the Hoover admin), The Anatomy of Fascism by Paxton which goes into the Von Papen government in detail. There have been recent studies that find that centrist domestic policies like austerity correlate strongly with the rise of far right popularity. 
			
			Now establishing that, Biden's admin has effectively killed all energy of protest movements. BLM, immigration movement, antiwar movement, antifascist movement have all been demobilized, for various reasons, as a result of Bidens presidency, making the country poorly situated for any kind of resistance to a far right candidate whether in 2024 or 2028 and beyond.
			
			My point here is that the left does not agree with the premise that Biden is a better alternative, not because of the immediate benefits but because of future losses, and a reduced scrutiny of the current abuses under Biden.

				The Biden administration hasn't been pushing for austerity though, so I'm not sure how that's relevant.
				
				> Now establishing that, Biden's admin has effectively killed all energy of protest movements.
				
				Those protest movements have been utterly useless for decades.  I recall the largest antiwar protest in US history happening in the run up to the Iraq war, and it was summarily ignored and made no difference.  I remember the feminist pink hats worn by the huge protests for the Trump inauguration.  Those didn't matter.  Occupy Wallstreet and BLM made no differences.  I support the goals of all of these groups, but they aren't effective and are essentially just acting as a release valve where people can go scream and bang drums while standing around and go home and feel that they made a difference.  Voting is far more important than standard protesting.
				
				> as a result of Bidens presidency, making the country poorly situated for any kind of resistance to a far right candidate whether in 2024 or 2028 and beyond.
				
				Here's the real problem with this view -- look around the world, take North Korea or Russia for example.  Those people have it really bad, and occasionally people stand up but the reality is that there's no way a grassroots effort will be able to stand up against authoritarian governments like that.  We saw also what happened in Iran and how quickly they went from a modern society to a religious totalitarian theocracy despite it not being all that popular.
				
				To me it seems like the left should take a similar approach to what the far right Republicans have done.  Slowly turn up the heat, electing people that match their goals more and more over time and pull the party in the direction they want.  Obviously there are complexities such as the wealthy manipulating voters into supporting extremists right-wing candidates to distract from handouts to the rich that don't directly apply for the Democrats, but the overall process would be similar.  The left should start electing local leftist candidates, move their way up, and establish a strong left-wing organization within the Democratic party to pull voters and their candidates to where they want to be.  This idea of left-wing voters taking their ball and going home just makes the Democratic party more centrist because that's who shows up to vote.

			I’m not the guy you responded to, but it sounds like he isn’t going to be able to give a robust response right now. I’ll give you my 2 cents. Full disclosure, I haven’t decided yet how to handle this choice as a leftist in next years election, but I can see the calculus and try and explain it if you want. 
			
			First thing you need to do is get a little more specific than “the left.” The left is a nebulous and largely useless term at this point, and this exact question is a good demonstration of that reality. Fundamentally, there is a schism brewing between liberals, for whom Biden is a solid figurehead, and the various factions to the left of them like myself. Israel/Palestine has widened these cracks rapidly, but they’ve been showing since at least 2016. 
			
			There’s lots of tiny groups in the coalition generally referred to as the American left, and I don’t speak for any of them obviously. I am an anarcho-communist, which I’m not going to get in the weeds of defining, but functionally what that means is that electoral politics are somewhere between futile and counterproductive to my political goals, trending toward counterproductive on a daily basis. When it comes to Biden, I agree he is a competent leader, but the system he represents and sustains is in extreme opposition to my views. He also has absolutely no interest in throwing people like me a bone on even compromised and extremely popular measures like universal healthcare, improving the currently heinous housing situation, or taking serous action on climate change. The best I can say about Biden is that he is competent and doesn’t want to actively exterminate political minorities. 
			
			On the other hand, Trump represents an explicit slide into fascism. Fascists are the perennial nemesis of us communists, and life will definitely be worse for many people under the Christian nationalist fascist regime that will follow. 
			
			On the other, other hand, fascism is a death cult. It’s unsustainable by design, it will almost certainly collapse the current world economic order, killing a lot of people in the process. That’s not a good thing, but it’s the only path I see to actually disrupting the neoliberal hegemony. Something will follow the Christian nationalist death cult in a few decades, and that’s a potential net positive for the world. 
			
			At this point, the liberal establishment has no convincing answer to the rising fascist tide. Biden isn’t going to stop it. At the absolute best, he will delay it another 4 years. The Democrat party has demonstrated extreme and ardent resistance to any meaningful concession to leftists, and is not even pretending to curtail imperialistic interventionism. It seems to me that a fascist government is inevitable, given the attitude of the Democrat party, and this is supported by historical failures of liberal governments to resist fascist takeovers. 
			
			So what does 4 more years of imperialistic, climate destroying capitalism get us? I’m not sure the earth has 4 more years of this status quo left in it before the cataclysm of climate change becomes irreversible. American fascism will lead to a lot of horrors, but so will the longer-term apathy of liberals. If we’re fucked either way, it makes a certain amount of sense to go ahead and get it started. 
			
			And, again, to reiterate, I’m still undecided on this question. But that’s the dilemma that people like me face. Biden has absolutely no interest whatsoever in enacting anything at all that I care about. Voting for him would be nothing but a vote against trump. I already did that once, and now we know for certain that he will not budge on giving leftists something to hope in. 
			
			Another way to say it is, the Democrats have made their own calculus that leftists like me will support them even though they actively don’t give a single fuck about what we care about. Me voting for Biden would be like going back to an abusive spouse just because you’re scared of that psycho skinhead that lives across the street. Either way it’s fucked.

				People dismiss you because you miss the forest for the trees.
				
				The reality is that the more Republicans are elected, the more rights are under threat.
				
				There is no clearer evidence of this than Roe v Wade being repealed. You can 'both sides' every issue until the cows go home but it is an unarguable fact that not electing Hillary led to abortion being banned in half the country. 
				
				Millions of women don't have reproductive rights directly because of Republicans. And please don't try and blame this on Dems, I know how much you want to. Codifying Roe into law would have taken 60 senate votes, votes that Dems have rarely had and when they did, they either: 
				
				\- used it on something more pressing like healthcare
				
				\- assumed that Roe was law of the land and decided not to spend precious political capital on it. A fair assumption in my opinion until there was a 6-3 supreme court.
				
				\- never actually had 60 pro choice votes because of conservative Dems in red states.
				
				Working class women in red states have been punished severely as a result of Roe being repealed. And while everyone wrings Biden out for not passing their purity test, Republicans turn their attention to other rights to take away such as birth control, no fault divorces and postal voting.
				
				Stop waiting for a perfect candidate to float from heaven to align perfectly with all your perfect views. Biden has accomplished a lot and if he still had the House, would have done even more. Politics has always been about compromise.

They have seen their jobs offshored, their children maimed or killed in vast foreign policy blunders, they watch their taxes go up while their fortunes decline while the rich lawlessly plunder the world.
			
			Maybe the greatest feat of the US media/propaganda system is instead of electing politicians who could fix some of these problems and represent anyone who is not a  donor, they select a member of this same ruling class who's personal style offends the neoliberal establishment. Instead of electing a revolutionary they selected a troll.

	So a person's character and actual decisions don't matter?  Just as long as he's more left leaning than the other guy.  

	Think about what this would mean for a conservative.  Everytime you highlight something bad about Trump's personal life, or decision he's made that goes against the grain amongst conservatives, broken promises etc... that is all basically bullshit in your eyes.

		I mean... yes? It's shitty, but with a first past the post single member district this is absolutely the calculus you need to make. In 2016 enough conservatives held their noses to vote for a horrendous candidate because he promised to deliver policies they wanted, and they were able to pull it off. They realized they could block democrats from controlling the supreme court for a generation, and now they have not just a majority, but a super majority that likely will stick around for decades blocking any hope for a variety of issues from campaign finance reform to abortion rights to redistricting. If you're a conservative the gamble on Trump seems to have paid off and then some.

They are the head of state, and responsible for all diplomatic and foreign affairs. Also they are responsible for the nation’s military, intelligence, defense, and law enforcement.

	Question: when we're talking about "bad political calculus" here, why is this framing explicitly around blaming voters for things they can't control? Maybe you consider this outside the scope of your view, but I don't really see the difference in spirit. You have a group of people saying, "I don't want to vote for someone who does xyz," and the response is to berate them. Not to actually stop doing xyz. Not to run a candidate that isn't doing xyz. Just to continually tell them that they are evil and wrong

	If we expand this outside of "the left," Biden's polling numbers are fucking awful with pretty much everyone except for anti-Trump republicans, who aren't going to vote for him anyway. We are a year out from the vote. Biden is, statistically, the worst person in the party (next to his VP), to run against Trump if you wan to win. Again, this is without "the left." Which continues to beg the question: who is the one making the "bad political calculus" here, really?

	"The left" generally believes that in a democracy, government power is derived from, and beholden to, the people. The idea that everyone has to just keep voting blue no matter what or who is antithetical to that idea

		Because usually the opinion they are mad about is a minority viewpoint that most people do not share. Why should the entire party cater to them and not the much larger group of voters who disagree with them? A large plurality of Democrats for example support continuing aid to Israel, why would a Democratic candidate cater to a much smaller minority who want to cut aid entirely? Very few support a total cutoff for Israel, yet this is the ultimatum they are making.

			The alternative is to do some actual politics and try to negotiate the issue at hand. But that's not being done. Instead, one side will just repeatedly tell this minority group that their moral stances don't matter, but they need to vote a specific way, and if they don't they're a bad person
			
			Not that it matters that much, but the entire history of social and economic progress that liberals claim as their legacy is pretty much every "minority viewpoint" that most people don't share and that "the left" has been mad about eventually turning out to be the correct and moral position that everyone else should have had from the start

				The issue with "generic unnamed democrat" polling is that this candidate doesn't exist. No person in the Democratic party seems reasonably poised to unite the party better than Biden. Anyone more palatable to the left of the party (like say Elizabeth Warren) is less popular with the right of the party than Biden, let alone the general electorate. Anyone more palatable to the right of the party (for sake of argument say Pete Buttigieg, even though I wouldn't class him as further right than Biden) would lose most of the progressive vote anyway.  
				    
				An argument can be made than Biden is the furthest president to the left since FDR. He certainly is far further left in practice than Obama, despite having a more or less adversarial Congress for the entirety of his Presidency. I don't think progressives have a candidate that can do better while maintaining enough support on the right to win the primary and the general.

	So the issue first, then the calculus.

	Biden is currently firmly in support of funding Israel and is in no way at all opposed to what the IDF is currently doing.   

	While I don't think Trump would have any more sympathy for Palestinians, I don't think he has any less sympathy either, once you hit the 'I literally don't care if you all die' point, you can't go lower.   

	Trump I also genuinely believe is actually less inclined to war with Iran or other countries than Biden would be.   

	Trump also personally hates Bibi Netanyahu. 

	So if you're single issue voting, I would vote for Trump on that one issue. 

	  

	Now on the calculus itself, 

	It's extremely clear what the democrats have been trying to do, They are essentially saying Option B is soooo bad that you MUST vote for Option A, and we REFUSE to negotiate or change any policies or anything on the Option A side. 

	I think a valid response to that is to at the very least refuse to agree to vote for A. Make them do something, make them make some concession, make your vote conditional on changing policies to be something you want. 

	The Democrats best case scenario right now would be for Biden to drop out entirely, refusing to vote for him would help accomplish that and you might get someone who could both beat Trump and have actual left leaning policies. 

	In the longer term too though, if Biden does end up losing to Trump, you at least set the stage for the future.   

	When Clinton lost, they didn't learn any lessons, they blamed Bernie and Russians and Sexism all this stuff.

	With Biden there's gonna be no excuse, He will lose because he offered Nothing to anyone and was basically a Republican-lite. 

	So then after the Trump Dictatorship ends upon his death in 2031 the dems might decide to stop trying to run Corporate Democrats in the next election.

Israel is an important strategic ally of the US in the Middle East, and no--***no***\--realistically electable President under current circumstances would be unsupportive of it in this situation. Biden's approach to the situation in the Levant has been more favorable to Palestinians than any President in the history of the conflict. Would I want more extreme support for Palestine? Absolutely, and I vote that way in primaries. The general is a whole different thing.
		
		Further, Biden's admin has been the most progressive since Carter, and the most successfully progressive since LBJ. Not sure how that happened if moderate Dems are refusing to compromise with Leftists and Progressives. If you look at Biden's stances and policies throughout his career, it's very clear that he's migrated significantly to the left as President when compared with his earlier years.

	Unless the Democrats are forced to earn the votes of the Left, and those who feel there is no point to vote, then the cycle will continue. The lesser evil is not lesser if the only objective difference is rhetoric.

						Healthcare? Really? trump wanted to end the ACA. Biden has supported it and lowered drug prices for tons of the most commonly used drugs, including insulin. Their policies are night and day different. 
						
						Foreign Affairs. Trump would have looked the other way on Russia invading Ukraine, and would have actually given Israel free reign to do what they please, while not caring at all about Palestinians. Biden has advised restraint, pushed for humanitarian pauses and succeed in getting a ceasefire through. He has he leverage to do that because of that material support you're complaining about.
						
						Welfare? Are you fucking kidding me? Do you pay attention to ANYTHING? trumps version of welfare was the PPP, unlimited loans to companies, ripe to be taken advantage of by bad actors like himself. Biden's version was to make the Child Tax Care credit permanent, make school lunches free, and has successfully invest BILLIONS of dollars in poor communities, through infrastructure, education and manufacturing jobs.

	My only argument is that third parties are only unviable in the short term, but support for them now will make them more viable over time and will lead to more viable options for left leaning/all kinds of political ideologies in the future.

	I’m under no illusion that a third party candidate will win any of the next few elections. But there is a mass cognitive dissonance in the country right now where many people hate the two party system but they aren’t willing to vote against it. Both Republicans and Democrats support anti-third party sentiments in general, but play into it more when it suits them best (for example, republicans flip flopping on Kennedy Jr. in the past few months. Many popular conservative figures have outright admitted they switched positions bc Kennedy Jr. started to eat into Trump’s numbers). Kennedy Jr. currently has a sizable portion of the polls (20ish%). Historic events suggest this will go down by the time the election rolls around, but a big health episode for Biden/Trump or a guilty charge for Trump could actually boost his current polls. Kennedy Jr. won’t win the next election, but he’s big enough to make both parties sweat right now. An election with big numbers for Kennedy Jr. will help break down the idea that a third party vote is a wasted vote in the public. Seeing your third party candidate get one percent of the vote is pretty discouraging. Seeing a third party candidate pull double digits (let alone 20+%) can lead to optimism. Doing it multiple elections in a row will eventually lead to two likely scenarios. 1) A major party, such as the Democrats, will concede on policies to become more in line with the third party in order to regain their share of the votes. If the third party candidate is more left leaning, then the Democrats will try to compromise to the left. 2) A third party candidate will win a major election/third party candidates will become more numerous in Congress and they will be able to enact policy changes themselves. 

	Third parties may not be viable today, but acting like they are a wasted vote is the only real reason they aren’t viable in the long term. A gradual change in this stigma will lead to them being more viable over time. A young person that doesn’t align with either party should vote for a third party and convince other young people to do so. The older generation that doesn’t believe in third parties/supports the current two party system will eventually phase out. Depending on the generation, they may have only 10-20 years of voting left, which means they don’t have time to wait for a gradual shift towards a third party. A young person still has their whole life ahead of them, so it’s more beneficial for them to stick it out for the long run. 

	In reality, I think third parties have a lot lined up against them. Often times they have lackluster candidates and inconsistent platforms (look at old libertarian debates from the 2016 election for a recent example of amusing chicanery). Many mainstream media outlets and the major political parties are against them. The only way for them to win over time is from a gradual change through grassroots support. Obviously it hasn’t happened yet (at least in modern history), but I think the age of the internet has made it more likely than ever. We are less reliant on elites for information, which means more alternative sources/opinions can be heard and disseminated. Our system isn’t perfect, but there is more opportunity than ever for change and I think a few more elections with historically unpopular candidates will help pave the way for third parties.

	So to address the point of “bad political calculus”, it depends on a voter’s overall goal and timeframe for change. If they want an immediate result (like keeping Trump out of office), then voting for Biden is the best choice. If they want to eventually have more left leaning policies/more options for leftist parties, then voting for a third party is the better choice, especially if they don’t care about how long it takes to accomplish it. Elections have different stakes for different people. A person who is comfortably middle class or a rich elite could possibly say voting in the short term is bad calculus since it leads to a greater loss over time. For them, it is easier to vote in the long run since their lives are much more stable in the present. Someone struggling financially, with healthcare, or who could potentially go to war depending on who is the president is more likely to vote with their short term interests in mind.

		I just want to add that voting 3rd party also makes it logistically easier for them to get ballot access in future elections. 3rd parties have to use much of their limited resources just getting the signatures and fighting the legal battles required to get on the ballot (with the duopoly fighting tooth and nail every step of the way).
		
		IF they get enough % of the votes, however, they may get ballot access on a future election without going through that whole resource-draining process again. The exact rules vary by state. See: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access
		
		For someone dissatisfied with the current system AND living in a district that is already certainly going red or blue, it therefore makes more sense to vote 3rd party as long as there are candidates available that you agree with.
		
		In a district that could go either way I do get the argument to vote for the "least bad" duopoly candidate, though.

	You’re equating the US electoral college system with a straight FPTP system, which is not accurate. If you’re in a swing state where there is a chance your vote could make a difference, e.g., Florida in 2000, then I will grant your argument. But in heavily partisan states, your vote (or non vote), and even the vote of a reasonable number of likeminded colleagues, is not going to change the results. But an unexpectedly high turn out for the Green Party in Texas, or low youth vote in California, could happen and be noted, and have a marked effect on political parties moving forward.

	The impact of your vote will still almost always be quite tiny, but a rational person can stretch that impact through a protest vote.

	In my (admittedly limited) experience, I think that point 2 "Both parties are the same or insufficiently different" is the motivating calculus for a lot of folks. For example, folks with ties to Palestinian communities might look at the current arrangement and decide that there is no meaningful difference between Biden and Trumps' policies towards Israel and Palestine. Biden seems disinclined to do anything to stop the massacres, so there's a real question about whether he is substantively better than Trump. Given that Muslim and Palestinian communities were vital to Biden's win in a couple states, they may feel betrayed and choose not to vote for him as punishment. Similarly, allies of these communities might feel compelled to withhold their votes in solidarity.

	Of course, this kind of approach to voting requires a single-issue mindset. I think it's debatable whether any significant number of people will actually withhold votes solely because of Palestine, especially if they are also thinking about abortion, LGBTQ rights, and a host of other issues where Biden has a better track record. However, given the narrow margins by which Biden won several states, even a small number of defectors could have monumental consequences. We're seeing this mainly in Michigan, where Biden won by a very slim margin, of which quite a few were Muslim. A lot of folks on the left know that he can't afford to lose many votes in 2024 and they're trying to use that as political leverage to alter his position.

	Finally, though, I think you're running into the difficulty with political calculus that makes voter prediction so challenging: people rarely vote rationally. You provided a rational breakdown of why left-leaning folks should vote for Biden, but there's a lot more emotion that goes into voting than logic. Hence why we still have people voting for third parties despite there being absolutely zero chance of those parties gaining any meaningful traction. Sometimes folks just get angry and don't think things through.

		Technically if a voter’s single issue is Palestine, abortion or climate change, as bad as Biden is, you would still have to vote for him because Trump’s actually not the same. He will make things worse. And if you really cared, you would have to fight for it. So it comes down to which would give you a better chance? It’s still Biden.
		
		Unfortunately, most voters are not logical or rational so they might not be able to make that distinction. For the sake of the world, I hope Biden wins and we get another 4 years to try and make headway in America. We’re already failing as it is to survive climate change.

	It is completely possible to be a left leaning person and yet actively support Trump and the same vice versa. 

	Consider someone who is a socialist trade union activist who wants to collectivise labour. Both Biden and Trump are economically far to the right of them economically and yet that left wing person might also dislike American involvement in the war in Ukraine, want to substantially reduce immigration and oppose any moves to further restrict firearms in the US. That person may weigh up their political options and decide (possibly through gritted teeth) that Trump more aligns with them.

	Then consider someone who has conventionally liberal politics and aspirations, say their biggest issues are things like healthcare reform, raising the minimum wage and fighting climate change and yet for whatever reason (say that they are a low information voter with a lot of influential maga family) they believe the 2020 election was rigged and think Biden is a threat to democracy. That person may decide (again possibly through gritted teeth) that Trump is less of a threat.

	Then consider someone who has something obvious to gain or lose that trumps their political philosophy. Someone can be as ideologically left wing as you like but if they have a job in the oil industry they might assess that they are going to be personally way better off under a Trump presidency.

	A successful politician in a democracy meets voters where they are at.

	80% of the voters that make up the "Democratic Voter" base believes the administration should be pressing for a ceasefire.  If you don't meet those voters where they are at, you cannot be surprised that some of those voters take issue with that to the level of not voting for Joe Biden.  Especially if those voters are minorities in this country who may empathize with the Palestinian plight more than your average suburban white voter; which is the voter Biden is actively courting.

	I can visualize a Millennial or Gen-Z voter who worked tirelessly in 2020 knocking on doors for Biden, even after Bernie Sanders lost, because they believed that Biden would try to meet them half-way.  Now that its 3 years later...Their student loans haven't been forgiven.  Their healthcare, rent, and groceries are all much more expensive than they were 3 years ago.  The Child Tax Credit was allowed to lapse instead of being renewed.  They got a wage bump, but its a net loss when you consider the price increases elsewhere, and now you're asking them to back a president actively funding a war they stand against deeply.

	I think its just that simple.  These voters you are wondering about aren't opposed to meeting in the middle, but everytime they are asked to compromise, they will then get asked to compromise again, and again.

	Medicare for All becomes the Public Option becomes the standard ACA and 10 drugs can have price negotiations through Medicare.

	Free Tuition at Public Universities becomes Free Community College becomes some student debt forgiveness becomes very little student debt forgiveness.

	Free Childcare/Childcare for All becomes expanded Child Tax Credit becomes the lapsing of the Child Tax Credit and returning to the pre-covid level of government help, only everything is more expensive, so its....worse?

	I'm not necessarily saying the leftists are approaching it the right way, but I don't think the centrists have operated in good faith when working with the progressives/leftists, and this is not the first time things have played out this way.  From the Leftist perspective, The centrists are Lucy pulling the football from Charlie Brown, only we come back around every 4 years and they tell the Leftist "Don't you understand, we had to pull that football!"

	EDIT:  I should apologize, as not all of this was necessarily cohesive.  I don't personally subscribe to the vote withholding, but I understand why people would feel that way and I don't try to convince those people anymore.  The more time passes, the more I can empathize with their stance.

	Many of the arguments in favour of leftists voting for Biden only really make sense if you ignore the existence of future elections. 

	Here is the problem with lesser-evilism - it just begets more evil. From a basic game theory perspective, if being left of the Republican nominee is a sufficient criterion to garner the support of anyone to Biden's left, the only rational response from the Democrats is to keep moving further and further right to pick up support from Republicans (basically what they've done for half a century now). This also allows the Republicans to become ever more extreme as the "moderate" policy agendas start resembling hard right ones from decades past. If the left want concessions from the Democrats, they have to be willing to withold their vote in certain circumstances. 

	This is not an argument against compromise or in favour of "purity tests" (an absurdly overused term in political discourse). Just as the left will never gain anything by pledging their vote to the Democrats unconditionally, they will also never get anything from the Democrats if they're viewed as totally unwinnable. If left-wing support for Democrats is contingent on them overthrowing capitalism or imprisoning landlords the Democrats will just ignore them. 

	In electoral politics, votes are the only leverage the left has. If they want to accomplish anything through the ballot box, they need to be willing to use that leverage, even if it sometimes means a marginally less bad politician sometimes loses to a worse one. People who shut up and fall in line will never have their issues addressed.

		>Many of the arguments in favour of leftists voting for Biden only really make sense if you ignore the existence of future elections.
		
		I think there are some fundamental flaws to the argument you're making. In particular, it completely elides over the primary elections, and treats "who becomes the Democratic nominee" as a decision made by, effectively, a single individual, or a small committee, such that "I did X to teach that person a lesson" or "I did X in order to apply pressure to that person" might make sense.
		
		IF the democratic nominee was, in fact, chosen in the proverbial smoke-filled room by a small group of elite Democratic power brokers, then maybe it might make sense for all the leftists to stay home from voting in the general election, while very publicly saying "we refuse to vote for a candidate who is that centrist", because maybe the benefit of getting a chance at a more progressive nominee in four years outweighs the cost of four years of a GOP presidency. Maybe. I'm still very skeptical the math would really work out, as it only turns out right for you if (a) the committee does in fact nominate a progressive candidate (not guaranteed) and (b) the progressive candidate does in fact win the general election.
		
		All of that said, though, the nominee is NOT chosen in a smoke-filled room. I'm not saying there is no finger-on-the-scales going on where party elites can make it easier or harder for certain candidates, but I do think that's overblown... witness Obama beating Hillary in the 2008 primary. Did Biden end up as the nominee in 2020 because a group of powerful people gathered together and decided he should be? Or did he become the nominee because more people voted for him in South Carolina than voted for Bernie, Pete, Warren, or any of the other people who were running at the time? Fundamentally, I think your "do X to apply pressure to the dems and force a more progressive nominee" argument just falls apart when you realize it has to apply not to a person or small group, but to the masses of millions of voters. 
		
		The most important thing in who the nominee is, and how progressive they are, is not the desires of a small possibly-pressurable-cabal. It's the candidate.
		
		You know what by FAR the most likely path is to have a reasonably progressive democratic nominee for president? It's for AOC to get a few more years under her belt, continue to be both a boss bitch (in the best sense of the words) and a social media genius, and for her to run. The fact that she's known and popular and photogenic is worth a billion times more than all the "if we refuse to vote, that will send X message to Y people" strategizing you could possibly do.
		
		Stepping back for a moment, btw, I think a real problem in discussions of this kind is the laser focus on purely the presidential election, and specifically purely the general election after the nominees are decided. I think people on the left hear "you HAVE to vote dem in the presidential election, if not you are (some hyperbolic Hitler comparison)" and react as if they're being told they must vote for the party-line DNC-approved candidate on all levels in all races. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I'm pretty firmly in the "it's crazy and irresponsible for anyone on the left not to vote for the democratic candidate for president" camp... but that doesn't really apply in any other context, and it PARTICULARLY doesn't apply in primary elections. We need more AOCs and Bernies in congress and in statehouses. You want to support more progressive candidates than the DNC-approved ones in primary elections? Great! You should! It's good for democracy as a whole that you have that level of passion and civic engagement. But the general presidential election, due to the combination of FPTP voting, and the lasting impact of presidents due to supreme court nominations, is the worst possible place to be trying to play my-vote-sends-a-message games.

			>I think there are some fundamental flaws to the argument you're making. In particular, it completely elides over the primary elections, and treats "who becomes the Democratic nominee" as a decision made by, effectively, a single individual, or a small committee, such that "I did X to teach that person a lesson" or "I did X in order to apply pressure to that person" might make sense.
			
			Are we having a presidential primary ahead of next year's election? Seems like the DNC is certainly deciding for the voters this go-round at least. 
			
			That aside, it doesn't matter how many people are involved in the decision, the game theory falls out the same. Witholding one's vote is the only leverage smaller voting blocs have to extract concessions out of a political party. Even if we pretend the presidential nominee is selected by a vote of all Democratic supporters, it would still be reasonable to withold one's vote if the result of that selection is fundamentally unacceptable to you. The decision makers, whether that's one individual or millions, can then take that into account and decide to either forgo the bloc's votes or alter their own behaviour to try and attract them next time.
			
			Republicans have had plenty of success with the strategy I've endorsed over the years. A relatively small group of hardliners basically said, "We're not showing up for milquetoast socially moderate neoliberals." Romney and McCain lost. And then they got a candidate who fired up the base in a way not seen in decades - and won! I obviously can't say for sure whether that strategy would work for left-wingers, but it seems to me the strategy of voting for whoever the Democrats nominate has been a disaster over the past 40 years for anyone who cares about the material conditions of the working class.

And then they got a candidate who fired up the base in a way not seen in decades - and won!
				
				The key question, though, is why did Trump win? Were there lots of voters out there who were thinking "well, I'm choosing between the more moderate Marco Rubio and the more extreme Trump, I really like them both, but... hmm.... oh, yeah, lots of members of the extreme right of the party didn't vote at all or voted third party in 2012, well, guess that tips me to Trump"? No, of course not. They voted for Trump because they loved Trump, for their stupid Trump-loving reasons. 
				
				Which just reasserts the point I was making above about AOC. Voting for a candidate in a primary is not just some mathematical thing where there's a scale of candidates, from 0 to 50, with 0 being ultra progressive and 50 being centrist, and a voter might say "hmm, well, I really feel like I'm a 30, but last year I voted for a 30, and we lost because the left stayed home, so this year I'm going to vote for a 25". I mean, even if the vast vast majority of primary voters were so tuned in to politics that they were even aware of that, they wouldn't think like that, because that's not how people think during primary elections. Rather, they would be thinking "ooh, I like that Cory Booker" or "ooh, I don't like that Kamala Harris". The candidates who happen to be on the ballot, and their personalities and strengths and weaknesses, is a jillion times more relevant to the vast vast majority of primary voters than some complicated calculus involving that one article they half-paid-attention-to 3 years ago where some talking head opined about why their candidate lost last year.
				
				But, taking a step back for a second, I am absolutely 100% certain I am right. Why? Because it was already tried. 2016 was the absolutely perfect storm for this. It was an incredibly close election between a very centrist Democrat and literally the most awful human being who has ever been a major party candidate. You will never in your life get a better test for "if a centrist Dem loses and the left stays home, then in four years you'll get a progressive candidate". It was tried. It was given the best try possible. And it didn't work.

		If the left wants to accomplish anything through the ballot box, then they’re going to have to vote in the primaries in much greater numbers than they have been. This idea that a group that hasn’t provided as many votes as centrists in either primaries or general elections for decades is going to somehow gain more influence by turning themselves into an even smaller part of the electorate is delusional.
		
		In the past 50 years we’ve had two groups demonstrate how to effectively exert influence over a major party. After Roe v Wade conservative fundamentalists were able to force the Republican Party to take an increasingly hard line stance against abortion that is unpopular with the wider electorate. Starting in 2015 MAGA voters were able to take over the Republican Party to the extent that the vast majority of elected Republican have to trip over themselves to support Trump even if they privately despise him. Both of these groups accomplished this by aggressively and consistently voting in greater numbers in all Republican primaries. They didn’t do this by withholding their votes.
		
		That’s what the left needs to do to get what they want in the Democratic Party, not by sitting there waiting for centrist candidates who win their elections by campaigning to centrist voters to randomly start catering to the left even though the left can’t even support their own candidates enough to win most of the time, but by the left providing enough votes to get their own candidates nominated.

		I don't think it quite works that way. Parties try to win, but they are at the mercy of the primary process, which extremists *can* win (exhibit A: Donald Trump), and they are also made out of real people with real opinions who don't necessarily try to maximize their margin. Your influence isn't just your vote or lack thereof: you can also, you know, talk to them.
		
		There is a significant number of pragmatists at the center left who would be okay with more progressive policies, but don't think there is a path to victory with them. When a leftist withholds their vote, they do nothing to convince that bloc, because they simply do not think a platform that accedes to their demands would win the general (in other words, these votes can only be acquired in a hopeless situation, therefore their value is exactly zero). On the contrary, they will reluctantly move to the right to make up for the lost votes. But you know what *could* convince these pragmatists? A margin. If they see Biden win a blowout election, they know they can afford to lose some votes at the center. If a progressive comes with an interesting proposal that they think could make the country better, and they are reassured that it won't cost them an election, they'll consider it.
		
		It's all about risk/reward calculations: the higher your winning margin, the greater risks you will be willing to take to reap a reward. A policy that might cost you 2% of the vote or win 3% is a hard sell when your support is 51% vs 49%, but if it's 55-45, it's more acceptable.

	No one earns your vote just by being not as bad as the other candidate. If you always vote for the "lesser of two evils" then the parties won't need fight for your vote. 

	In the 2016 election Black voter turnout dropped 59%, down from 66% in 2012. In turn, in 2020, people fought harder for Black voters. Issues like justice reform and police reform became mainstream talking points, even Trump signed the First Step Act. Biden went out of his way to pick a Black VP. Black voter turnout rose up to 63% in 2020.   

	If Muslim/Palestinian/Gen Z Americans don't vote because they disagree with both parties on Israel/Palestine, it may signal to both parties in future years that this is an issue they need to take more seriously. It may lead to Dems changing their position on this issue faster.

	I think you are right to say that Trump might be less sympatric than Biden when in comes to Palestine. But we both probably never thought Trump would do anything like the First Step Act. I don't think Trump signed that because he suddenly became sympatric. I think it was a way to try and get a portion of the Black voters who stayed home in 2016. If there was a large number of Muslim/young voters who stayed home, it may lead to whoever wins the election thinking they need take that issue more seriously, so they can get those non-voters support in the next election.

		I highly doubt it. Obviously switching to that position does nothing to grow your base from the middle in, which is where most voters are. It may appease some people who weren't voting Republican anyway. That's not enough. It would also turn off a huge chunk of the electorate. Perhaps by even greater margins. Israel is still really popular in this country. Consider that Democrats became *more* [likely](https://www.brookings.ed[u/articles](https://www.reddit.com/user/articles)/is-the-israel-gaza-war-changing-us-public-attitudes/) to support Israel after the attacks (and after they entered Gaza).
		
		You should [take a look](https://thehill.com/policy/international/4318844-most-americans-support-israel-new-poll-finds/) at where Gen Z is on this issue. They're less likely to support Israel than older generations. But Israel still has a majority of support with the youngest voters. And [only 16%](https://www.brookings.ed[u/articles](https://www.reddit.com/user/articles)/is-the-israel-gaza-war-changing-us-public-attitudes/) of *Democrats* under 35 think we lean towards Palestine's side.
		
		The number of young people who actually care about this issue is overstated, but those who do are much more likely to support Israel than the media portrays. Most young voters are concerned about wages, housing, and abortion right now.

	‘Lesser of two evils’ voting directly causes terrible candidates. People who refuse to vote biden are refusing to be a part of this cycle

	With an election wipeout, the DNC would be forced to radically change its platform or to leave itself open to a third party, that actually represents the left, from forming in its vacuum of power. If the DNC does well in this election (even if it loses) then nothing will change. People refusing to vote for Biden are understanding that nothing will change until this happens, so the sooner the DNC is wiped out at an election the sooner the left will have representation in government

	I don’t know how much you know about the undemocratic fixes at recent elections such as the DNC being taken to court (and losing) and having to pay out for election rigging, as well as admitting in court that they feel they have no obligation to pay any attention to their members’ votes whatsoever

	There are growing number of americans, already in the tens of millions, who are squarely to the left of bernie sanders. This includes huge numbers of people who are actively anti-capitalist and want to see the destruction of capitalism in their lifetime. Whether you agree with them or not, you can’t disagree that they are not remotely represented at any level of government in the US. Sanders is the leftmost extreme politician and he is pro-war, pro-capitalism, and supported israel’s genocide until he faced massive backlash for it and softened his position to the comfortable ‘both sides are bad’. Anybody to the left of Joe Biden is either barely, or not, represented by the DNC

	This election cycle they held all three levels of govt (presidency, senate and congress) and have campaigned for decades over codifying Roe vs Wade into law and it was during this administration that it got overturned. If they can go that far backwards on their primary election promise since the 1990s, as well as the massively unpopular actions of joe biden in essentially all other spheres, why would anybody vote for him?

	So those not voting are looking to undermine the entire two party ‘lesser of two evils’ system. They do not want to vote for joseph goebells because he is running against adolf hitler. Their vote just gives legitimacy to somebody they consider to be an unforgivable corrupt war criminal leading an administration and government that is completely corrupt

	Whether you agree with their politics or not, this is why so many people are drawing their line in the sand and refusing to vote for biden

	First, you've already cut the knees out from under your own point.

	Threatening not to vote is not credible unless there's some actual willingness not to vote.

	When the democrats are basically going to nominate a moribund, senile, corporate-sponsored politician who doesn't even want or believe in a credible pathway to universal healthcare, if you threaten not to vote for him, but don't carry out that threat, you've basically told The Party that the threat is empty.

	Second, Trump is widely overrated as a threat to democracy. He's an utter buffoon whose obvious fascist instincts are thwarted by his senile, witless operations. For fuck's sake, this guy brought in Rudy Giuliani as his Olivia Pope, or whatever TV show he thought real life was.

	The trump presidency was bad, but his biggest sin was getting a lot of his own voters killed: from a cold political calculus, dealing with him for a couple years is not a big deal.

	I'd actually be a lot more inclined to vote for Biden if DeSantis was on the other side, since he's a more credible threat.

	Unfortunately it's is set up so that any change in its forn will be decided by a small minority of our citizens, and no, they will not be working for us little guys.

	Joe Biden has had to govern within the constraints of that system.   That means compromise in order to create change.   It is frustrating to live under this system.   One never gets everything that they want. It resists and is very difficult 2 change.   And yet has created the wealthiest nation in the world although that wealth is unfairly distributed.   

	I submit that there is no peaceful way to change it, and I challenge you readers to tell me about all of the people's revolutions that have improved lives of any country's citizens.  Cuba?  Nicaragua?  Venezuela?  Russia? Etc.

	Biden has done Avery good job with what he was given.  Anyone blaming him for the inflation is misinformed.  To refuse to vote for him because, whatever, is to risk handing the Presidency to the Republicans at this critical time in the world.

	The Democrats are always arguing that they are the lesser of two evils. That party is comfortable knowing that leftists don't have another viable option in mainstream politics, and so when it comes time for an election like 2020, they can leverage the left's interest in voting against the Republicans to gain power, but when they take office, they run on unity and bipartisanship with a party they just got done calling fascists.

	Your political calculation rests on the idea that Biden is better for the country than the Republicans and while that may be true, it does not account for the idea that the left doesn't want the Democrats either. If it's true that the only viable options are Republicans and Democrats and the Democrats represent the left's interests better, then it is also in the left's best interest to hold Democrat's feet to the fire. We need to threaten not to vote for Democrats in order for the platform to change to court us.

If you only think about the current election and won’t withhold your vote then you never give your major party a reason to change.

	Generally, I think both sides of this view are far too focused on the presidency, and not nearly focused enough on other elected offices. When people go to vote, their choices aren't just Biden vs. Trump, or D vs. R. They're voting on a ton of other things up and down the ballot, and if you're in a deep blue area it's likely to be the case that which flavor of Democrat you're voting for is of critical importance. 

	So, with that in mind, the time and place where I think not voting for Biden makes a lot of electoral sense is if you're living in a very safe blue state. In 2020, Biden carried California by about 6 million votes. If you're a member of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party in California, voting for a more progressive Democrat or a third party candidate from one of the further left parties actually helps your party in the long run.

	First of all, it helps progressive third parties get on more ballots if they get over a certain threshold of popularity in an election. Second of all, it sends a strong message to the statewide Democratic Party that adopting progressive positions on local issues can help them win votes. If 1 million of those Biden voters stopped gritting their teeth and voting for the lesser of two evils, it might send a signal that there's an opportunity for a more progressive candidate. And existing elected officials might take the hint, and limit their support for Israel (if that's the issue), or embrace universal health care.

	There's nothing to change.  If you're voting third party (and considering how most third parties are complete clown-shoes I don't know why) or staying home, you're throwing.  That's just the reality of our current system.

	I really don't want to witness a sitting US president die of old age
