Israel has killed approximately 15,000 people in Gaza. And according to their own data between 87% and 94% have been civilians. Utterly indefensible.

This is insane: we've destroyed half of Gaza, displaced over 1.5 million people from their homes, murdered at least 6,000 children & were only able to kill 1,000-2,000 Hamas militants? theguardian.com/world/2023/nov

Am I weird for not believing a single word that Israel reports? 

They call everyone Hamas so this number might be inflated with civilians doctors and journalists, considering they callously shoot at anyone

Sheer propaganda with no basis in fact regards to casualties, just conjecture, media parroting Hamas. Do elderly, women, men, teenagers, children, act as combatants, terrorists, in Gaza? Yes, they do! There is no distinction made between combatants and non combatants. Numbers

Hamas sources. Garbage in garbage out.

I wouldn't trust apartheid Israel's estimates on the number of hamas fighters killed, they already said they'd consider anyone that didn't leave as hamas.

So where are the 15,000 bodies? Who verified these numbers! Sad for innocent people to die, no matter how many .

Own data? Where did they release a number of all Hamas fighters killed?

Yeah I don’t know man I think they might be kind of bad at this.

People are actually on this platform arguing that since 10 percent of Germans died in WW2 The casualty loss in Palastine means nothing, regardless if it's Hamas or Civilian. Let. That. Sink. In. The threshold they have is 10 percent and than maybe they'll see it as "excessive"

Israhell is defeated and lose face by Hamas

That’s pretty much what happens in any war ever, though. The question I would ask: is waging a war against Gaza justified or not?
