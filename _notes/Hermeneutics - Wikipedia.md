**Hermeneutics** ()<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> is the theory and [methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology "Methodology") of interpretation,<sup id="cite_ref-ahd_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-ahd-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-mw_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-mw-3">[3]</a></sup> especially the interpretation of [biblical texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_hermeneutics "Biblical hermeneutics"), [wisdom literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_literature "Wisdom literature"), and [philosophical texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy").<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> As necessary, hermeneutics may include the art of understanding and communication.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

[Modern hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#Modern_hermeneutics) includes both verbal and non-verbal communication,<sup id="cite_ref-Routledge_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Routledge-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-JMN_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-JMN-8">[8]</a></sup> as well as [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics "Semiotics"), [presuppositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presupposition "Presupposition"), and pre-understandings. Hermeneutics has been broadly applied in the [humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities "Humanities"), especially in law, history and theology.

Hermeneutics was initially applied to the interpretation, or [exegesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis "Exegesis"), of [scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_texts "Religious texts"), and has been later broadened to questions of general interpretation.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-:0-9">[9]</a></sup> The terms _hermeneutics_ and _exegesis_ are sometimes used interchangeably. Hermeneutics is a wider discipline which includes written, verbal, and nonverbal<sup id="cite_ref-Routledge_7-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Routledge-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-JMN_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-JMN-8">[8]</a></sup> communication. Exegesis focuses primarily upon the word and grammar of [texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_(literary_theory) "Text (literary theory)").

Hermeneutic, as a [count noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_noun "Count noun") in the singular, refers to some particular method of interpretation (see, in contrast, [double hermeneutic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hermeneutic "Double hermeneutic")).

## Etymology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Etymology")\]

_Hermeneutics_ is derived from the Greek word ἑρμηνεύω (_hermēneuō_, "translate, interpret"),<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> from ἑρμηνεύς (_hermeneus_, "translator, interpreter"), of uncertain etymology ([R. S. P. Beekes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._P._Beekes "Robert S. P. Beekes") (2009) suggests a [Pre-Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Greek "Pre-Greek") origin).<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> The technical term ἑρμηνεία (_hermeneia_, "interpretation, explanation") was introduced into philosophy mainly through the title of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle")'s work Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας ("Peri Hermeneias"), commonly referred to by its Latin title _[De Interpretatione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Interpretatione "De Interpretatione")_ and translated in English as _On Interpretation_. It is one of the earliest (c. 360 <small>BCE</small>) extant philosophical works in the [Western tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy "Western philosophy") to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit and formal way.

The early usage of "hermeneutics" places it within the boundaries of the [sacred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred "Sacred").<sup id="cite_ref-Grondin_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Grondin-12">[12]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 21">: 21 </span></sup>  A [divine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinity "Divinity") message must be received with implicit uncertainty regarding its truth. This ambiguity is an irrationality; it is a sort of madness that is inflicted upon the receiver of the message. Only one who possesses a rational method of interpretation (i.e., a hermeneutic) could determine the truth or falsity of the message.<sup id="cite_ref-Grondin_12-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Grondin-12">[12]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 21–22">: 21–22 </span></sup> 

### Folk etymology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Folk etymology")\]

_[Hermes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes "Hermes")_, messenger of the gods

[Folk etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_etymology "Folk etymology") places its origin with [Hermes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes "Hermes"), the mythological Greek [deity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity "Deity") who was the 'messenger of the gods'.<sup id="cite_ref-Couzen-Hoy_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Couzen-Hoy-13">[13]</a></sup> Besides being a mediator among the gods and between the gods and men, he led souls to the [underworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades "Hades") upon death.

Hermes was also considered to be the inventor of language and speech, an interpreter, a liar, a thief and a trickster.<sup id="cite_ref-Couzen-Hoy_13-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Couzen-Hoy-13">[13]</a></sup> These multiple roles made Hermes an ideal representative figure for hermeneutics. As Socrates noted, words have the power to reveal or conceal and can deliver messages in an ambiguous way.<sup id="cite_ref-Couzen-Hoy_13-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Couzen-Hoy-13">[13]</a></sup> The Greek view of language as consisting of [signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics) "Sign (semiotics)") that could lead to truth or to falsehood was the essence of Hermes, who was said to relish the uneasiness of those who received the messages he delivered.

### Talmudic hermeneutics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Talmudic hermeneutics")\]

Summaries of the principles by which Torah can be interpreted date back to, at least, [Hillel the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_the_Elder "Hillel the Elder"), although the thirteen principles set forth in the [Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baraita_of_Rabbi_Ishmael "Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael") are perhaps the best known. These principles ranged from standard rules of logic (e.g., [_a fortiori_ argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_fortiori_argument "A fortiori argument") \[known in [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") as קל וחומר –  _kal v'chomer_\]) to more expansive ones, such as the rule that a passage could be interpreted by reference to another passage in which the same word appears ([Gezerah Shavah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmudical_Hermeneutics#Gezerah_Shavah "Talmudical Hermeneutics")). The [rabbis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi "Rabbi") did not ascribe equal persuasive power to the various principles.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

Traditional Jewish hermeneutics differed from the Greek method in that the rabbis considered the [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh "Tanakh") (the Jewish Biblical canon) to be without error. Any apparent inconsistencies had to be understood by means of careful examination of a given text within the context of other texts. There were different levels of interpretation: some were used to arrive at the plain meaning of the text, some expounded the law given in the text, and others found [secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esotericism "Esotericism") or [mystical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism") levels of understanding.

### Vedic hermeneutics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Vedic hermeneutics")\]

Vedic hermeneutics involves the exegesis of the [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas "Vedas"), the earliest holy texts of [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism"). The [Mimamsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%ABm%C4%81%E1%B9%83s%C4%81 "Mīmāṃsā") was the leading hermeneutic school and their primary purpose was understanding what [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma "Dharma") (righteous living) involved by a detailed hermeneutic study of the Vedas. They also derived the rules for the various rituals that had to be performed precisely.

The foundational text is the [Mimamsa Sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimamsa_Sutras "Mimamsa Sutras") of [Jaimini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaimini "Jaimini") (ca. 3rd to 1st century BCE) with a major commentary by [Śabara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Aabara "Śabara") (ca. the 5th or 6th century CE). The Mimamsa sutra summed up the basic rules for Vedic interpretation.

### Buddhist hermeneutics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Buddhist hermeneutics")\]

Buddhist hermeneutics deals with the interpretation of the vast [Buddhist literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_texts "Buddhist texts"), particularly those texts which are said to be spoken by the [Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha "Buddha") ([Buddhavacana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhavacana "Buddhavacana")) and other enlightened beings. Buddhist hermeneutics is deeply tied to Buddhist spiritual practice and its ultimate aim is to extract [skillful means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upaya "Upaya") of reaching spiritual enlightenment or [nirvana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana "Nirvana"). A central question in Buddhist hermeneutics is which Buddhist teachings are explicit, representing ultimate truth, and which teachings are merely conventional or relative.

### Biblical hermeneutics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Biblical hermeneutics")\]

Biblical hermeneutics is the study of the principles of interpretation of the Bible. While Jewish and Christian biblical hermeneutics have some overlap, they have distinctly different interpretive traditions.

The early [patristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers "Church Fathers") traditions of biblical [exegesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis "Exegesis") had few unifying characteristics in the beginning but tended toward unification in later schools of biblical hermeneutics.

[Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo "Augustine of Hippo") offers hermeneutics and [homiletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homiletics "Homiletics") in his _[De doctrina christiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_doctrina_christiana "De doctrina christiana")_. He stresses the importance of humility in the study of Scripture. He also regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith. In Augustine's hermeneutics, signs have an important role. God can communicate with the believer through the signs of the Scriptures. Thus, humility, love, and the knowledge of signs are an essential hermeneutical presupposition for a sound interpretation of the Scriptures. Although Augustine endorses some teaching of the [Platonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism "Platonism") of his time, he recasts it according to a theocentric doctrine of the Bible. Similarly, in a practical discipline, he modifies the classical theory of oratory in a Christian way. He underscores the meaning of diligent study of the Bible and prayer as more than mere human knowledge and oratory skills. As a concluding remark, Augustine encourages the interpreter and preacher of the Bible to seek a good manner of life and, most of all, to love God and neighbor.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

There is traditionally a fourfold sense of biblical hermeneutics: literal, moral, allegorical (spiritual), and anagogical.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

#### Literal\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Literal")\]

Encyclopædia Britannica states that literal analysis means “a biblical text is to be deciphered according to the ‘plain meaning’ expressed by its linguistic construction and historical context.” The intention of the authors is believed to correspond to the literal meaning. Literal hermeneutics is often associated with the verbal inspiration of the Bible.<sup id="cite_ref-Hermeneutics_2014_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Hermeneutics_2014-17">[17]</a></sup>

#### Moral\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Moral")\]

Moral interpretation searches for moral lessons which can be understood from writings within the Bible. Allegories are often placed in this category.<sup id="cite_ref-Hermeneutics_2014_17-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Hermeneutics_2014-17">[17]</a></sup>

#### Allegorical\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Allegorical")\]

Allegorical interpretation states that biblical narratives have a second level of reference that is more than the people, events and things that are explicitly mentioned. One type of allegorical interpretation is known as [typological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typology_(theology) "Typology (theology)"), where the key figures, events, and establishments of the Old Testament are viewed as “types” (patterns). In the New Testament this can also include foreshadowing of people, objects, and events. According to this theory, readings like Noah's Ark could be understood by using the Ark as a “type” of the Christian church that God designed from the start.<sup id="cite_ref-Hermeneutics_2014_17-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Hermeneutics_2014-17">[17]</a></sup>

#### Anagogical\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Anagogical")\]

This type of interpretation is more often known as mystical interpretation. It claims to explain the events of the Bible and how they relate to or predict what the future holds. This is evident in the [Jewish Kabbalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah "Kabbalah"), which attempts to reveal the mystical significance of the numerical values of [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language") words and letters.

In Judaism, anagogical interpretation is also evident in the medieval [Zohar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zohar "Zohar"). In Christianity, it can be seen in [Mariology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariology "Mariology").<sup id="cite_ref-Hermeneutics_2014_17-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Hermeneutics_2014-17">[17]</a></sup>

## Philosophical hermeneutics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Philosophical hermeneutics")\]

### Ancient and medieval hermeneutics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Ancient and medieval hermeneutics")\]

### Modern hermeneutics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Modern hermeneutics")\]

The discipline of hermeneutics emerged with the new [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism "Humanism") education of the 15th century as a historical and critical [methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology "Methodology") for analyzing texts. In a triumph of early modern hermeneutics, the Italian humanist [Lorenzo Valla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Valla "Lorenzo Valla") proved in 1440 that the _[Donation of Constantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Constantine "Donation of Constantine")_ was a forgery. This was done through intrinsic evidence of the text itself. Thus hermeneutics expanded from its medieval role of explaining the true meaning of the Bible.

However, biblical hermeneutics did not die off. For example, the [Protestant Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation "Protestant Reformation") brought about a renewed interest in the interpretation of the Bible, which took a step away from the interpretive tradition developed during the Middle Ages back to the texts themselves. [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther "Martin Luther") and [John Calvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin "John Calvin") emphasized _scriptura sui ipsius interpres_ (scripture interprets itself). Calvin used _[brevitas et facilitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevitas_et_facilitas "Brevitas et facilitas")_ as an aspect of [theological hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_hermeneutics "Theological hermeneutics").<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

The rationalist [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") led hermeneutists, especially [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant "Protestant") exegetists, to view Scriptural texts as secular classical texts. They interpreted Scripture as responses to historical or social forces so that, for example, apparent contradictions and difficult passages in the New Testament might be clarified by comparing their possible meanings with contemporary Christian practices.

[Friedrich Schleiermacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schleiermacher "Friedrich Schleiermacher") (1768–1834) explored the nature of understanding in relation not just to the problem of deciphering sacred texts but to all human texts and modes of communication.

The interpretation of a text must proceed by framing its content in terms of the overall organization of the work. Schleiermacher distinguished between grammatical interpretation and psychological interpretation. The former studies how a work is composed from general ideas; the latter studies the peculiar combinations that characterize the work as a whole. He said that every problem of interpretation is a problem of understanding and even defined hermeneutics as the art of avoiding misunderstanding. Misunderstanding was to be avoided by means of knowledge of grammatical and psychological laws.

During Schleiermacher's time, a fundamental shift occurred from understanding not merely the exact words and their objective meaning, to an understanding of the writer's distinctive character and point of view.<sup id="cite_ref-ramberg_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-ramberg-19">[19]</a></sup>

Nineteenth- and twentieth-century hermeneutics emerged as a theory of understanding (_[Verstehen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verstehen "Verstehen")_) through the work of [Friedrich Schleiermacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schleiermacher "Friedrich Schleiermacher") (**[Romantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena_Romanticism "Jena Romanticism") hermeneutics**<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> and **[methodological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_method "Scholarly method") hermeneutics**),<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> [August Böckh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_B%C3%B6ckh "August Böckh") (methodological hermeneutics),<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> [Wilhelm Dilthey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Dilthey "Wilhelm Dilthey") (**[epistemological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") hermeneutics**),<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> [Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger "Martin Heidegger") (**[ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") hermeneutics**,<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> [hermeneutic phenomenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_phenomenology "Hermeneutic phenomenology"),<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> and [transcendental hermeneutic phenomenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_hermeneutic_phenomenology "Transcendental hermeneutic phenomenology")),<sup id="cite_ref-stanford3.1_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-stanford3.1-28">[28]</a></sup> [Hans-Georg Gadamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Georg_Gadamer "Hans-Georg Gadamer") (ontological hermeneutics),<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> [Leo Strauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Strauss "Leo Strauss") (**Straussian hermeneutics**),<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> [Paul Ricœur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ric%C5%93ur "Paul Ricœur") (hermeneutic phenomenology),<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> [Walter Benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin "Walter Benjamin") ([Marxist hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_hermeneutics "Marxist hermeneutics")),<sup id="cite_ref-Erasmus_32-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Erasmus-32">[32]</a></sup> [Ernst Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Bloch "Ernst Bloch") (Marxist hermeneutics),<sup id="cite_ref-AL_33-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-AL-33">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Erasmus_32-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Erasmus-32">[32]</a></sup> [Jacques Derrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida "Jacques Derrida") (**radical hermeneutics**, namely [deconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction "Deconstruction")),<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-IIH_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-IIH-35">[35]</a></sup> [Richard Kearney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Kearney "Richard Kearney") ([diacritical hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritical_hermeneutics "Diacritical hermeneutics")), [Fredric Jameson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Jameson "Fredric Jameson") (Marxist hermeneutics),<sup id="cite_ref-Mohanty_36-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Mohanty-36">[36]</a></sup> and [John Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thompson_(sociologist) "John Thompson (sociologist)") ([critical hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_hermeneutics "Critical hermeneutics")).

Regarding the relation of hermeneutics with problems of [analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy "Analytic philosophy"), there has been, particularly among analytic Heideggerians and those working on Heidegger's [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science"), an attempt to try and situate Heidegger's hermeneutic project in debates concerning [realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism "Philosophical realism") and [anti-realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism "Anti-realism"): arguments have been presented both for Heidegger's **hermeneutic idealism** (the thesis that meaning determines [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference "Reference") or, equivalently, that our understanding of the being of entities is what determines entities as entities)<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> and for Heidegger's **hermeneutic realism**<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> (the thesis that (a) there is a nature in itself and science can give us an explanation of how that nature works, and (b) that (a) is compatible with the ontological implications of our everyday practices).<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>

Philosophers that worked to combine analytic philosophy with hermeneutics include [Georg Henrik von Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Henrik_von_Wright "Georg Henrik von Wright") and [Peter Winch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Winch "Peter Winch"). Roy J. Howard termed this approach **analytic hermeneutics**.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

Other contemporary philosophers influenced by the hermeneutic tradition include [Charles Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_(philosopher) "Charles Taylor (philosopher)")<sup id="cite_ref-ramberg_19-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-ramberg-19">[19]</a></sup> (**[engaged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engagement "Social engagement") hermeneutics**)<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> and [Dagfinn Føllesdal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagfinn_F%C3%B8llesdal "Dagfinn Føllesdal").<sup id="cite_ref-ramberg_19-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-ramberg-19">[19]</a></sup>

[Wilhelm Dilthey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Dilthey "Wilhelm Dilthey") broadened hermeneutics even more by relating interpretation to historical objectification. Understanding moves from the outer manifestations of human action and productivity to the exploration of their inner meaning. In his last important essay, "The Understanding of Other Persons and Their Manifestations of Life" (1910), Dilthey made clear that this move from outer to inner, from expression to what is expressed, is not based on [empathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy "Empathy"), understood as a direct identification with the [Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy) "Other (philosophy)"). Interpretation, on a hermeneutical conception of empathy<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> involves an indirect or mediated understanding that can only be attained by placing human expressions in their historical context. Thus, understanding is not a process of reconstructing the state of mind of the author, but one of articulating what is expressed in his work.

Dilthey divided sciences of the mind ([human sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sciences "Human sciences")) into three structural levels: experience, expression, and comprehension.

-   Experience means to feel a situation or thing personally. Dilthey suggested that we can always grasp the meaning of unknown thought when we try to experience it. His understanding of experience is very similar to that of [phenomenologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy) "Phenomenology (philosophy)") [Edmund Husserl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl "Edmund Husserl").
-   Expression converts experience into meaning because the discourse has an appeal to someone outside of oneself. Every saying is an expression. Dilthey suggested that one can always return to an expression, especially to its written form, and this practice has the same objective value as an experiment in science. The possibility of returning makes scientific analysis possible, and therefore the humanities may be labeled as science. Moreover, he assumed that an expression may be "saying" more than the speaker intends because the expression brings forward meanings which the individual consciousness may not fully understand.
-   The last structural level of the science of the mind, according to Dilthey, is comprehension, which is a level that contains both comprehension and incomprehension. Incomprehension means, more or less, _wrong understanding_. He assumed that comprehension produces coexistence: "he who understands, understands others; he who does not understand stays alone."

#### Heidegger (1889–1976)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Heidegger (1889–1976)")\]

In the 20th century, [Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger "Martin Heidegger")'s philosophical hermeneutics shifted the focus from interpretation to [existential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism "Existentialism") understanding as rooted in fundamental ontology, which was treated more as a direct—and thus more authentic—way of being-in-the-world (_In-der-Welt-sein_) than merely as "a way of knowing."<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> For example, he called for a "special hermeneutic of empathy" to dissolve the classic philosophic issue of "other minds" by putting the issue in the context of the being-with of human relatedness. (Heidegger himself did not complete this inquiry.)<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>

Advocates of this approach claim that some texts, and the people who produce them, cannot be studied by means of using the same [scientific methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method") that are used in the [natural sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_science "Natural science"), thus drawing upon arguments similar to those of [antipositivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipositivism "Antipositivism"). Moreover, they claim that such texts are conventionalized expressions of the experience of the author. Thus, the interpretation of such texts will reveal something about the [social context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_context "Social context") in which they were formed, and, more significantly, will provide the reader with a means of sharing the experiences of the author.

The reciprocity between text and context is part of what Heidegger called the [hermeneutic circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle "Hermeneutic circle"). Among the key thinkers who elaborated this idea was the [sociologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology") [Max Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber "Max Weber").

#### Gadamer (1900–2002)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Gadamer (1900–2002)")\]

[Hans-Georg Gadamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Georg_Gadamer "Hans-Georg Gadamer")'s hermeneutics is a development of the hermeneutics of his teacher, Heidegger. Gadamer asserted that methodical contemplation is opposite to experience and reflection. We can reach the truth only by understanding or mastering our experience. According to Gadamer, our understanding is not fixed but rather is changing and always indicating new perspectives. The most important thing is to unfold the nature of individual understanding.

Gadamer pointed out that prejudice is an element of our understanding and is not _per se_ without value. Indeed, prejudices, in the sense of pre-judgements of the thing we want to understand, are unavoidable. Being alien to a particular tradition is a condition of our understanding. He said that we can never step outside of our tradition—all we can do is try to understand it. This further elaborates the idea of the [hermeneutic circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle "Hermeneutic circle").

#### New hermeneutic\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: New hermeneutic")\]

[New hermeneutic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_hermeneutic "New hermeneutic") is the theory and methodology of interpretation to understand Biblical texts through [existentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism "Existentialism"). The essence of new hermeneutic emphasizes not only the existence of language but also the fact that language is eventualized in the history of individual life.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> This is called the event of language. [Ernst Fuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Fuchs_(theologian) "Ernst Fuchs (theologian)"),<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> [Gerhard Ebeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Ebeling "Gerhard Ebeling"), and [James M. Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_M._Robinson "James M. Robinson") are the scholars who represent the new hermeneutics.

#### Marxist hermeneutics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Marxist hermeneutics")\]

The method of **Marxist hermeneutics** has been developed by the work of, primarily, [Walter Benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin "Walter Benjamin") and [Fredric Jameson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Jameson "Fredric Jameson"). Benjamin outlines his theory of the allegory in his study _[Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_German_Tragic_Drama "The Origin of German Tragic Drama")_<sup id="cite_ref-Erasmus_32-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Erasmus-32">[32]</a></sup> ("Trauerspiel" literally means "mourning play" but is often translated as "tragic drama").<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> [Fredric Jameson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Jameson "Fredric Jameson") draws on Biblical hermeneutics, [Ernst Bloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Bloch "Ernst Bloch"),<sup id="cite_ref-Kaufmann_48-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Kaufmann-48">[48]</a></sup> and the work of [Northrop Frye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Frye "Northrop Frye"), to advance his theory of Marxist hermeneutics in his influential _[The Political Unconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Political_Unconscious "The Political Unconscious")_. Jameson's Marxist hermeneutics is outlined in the first chapter of the book, titled "On Interpretation"<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> Jameson re-interprets (and secularizes) the fourfold system (or four levels) of Biblical exegesis (literal; moral; allegorical; anagogical) to relate interpretation to the [mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production "Mode of production"), and eventually, history.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>

#### Objective hermeneutics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Objective hermeneutics")\]

[Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper "Karl Popper") first used the term "**objective hermeneutics**" in his _Objective Knowledge_ (1972).<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>

In 1992, the Association for Objective Hermeneutics (AGOH) was founded in [Frankfurt am Main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_am_Main "Frankfurt am Main") by scholars of various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Its goal is to provide all scholars who use the methodology of objective hermeneutics with a means of exchanging information.<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup>

In one of the few translated texts of this German school of hermeneutics, its founders declared:

> Our approach has grown out of the empirical study of family interactions as well as reflection upon the procedures of interpretation employed in our research. For the time being we shall refer to it as objective hermeneutics in order to distinguish it clearly from traditional hermeneutic techniques and orientations. The general significance for sociological analysis of objective hermeneutics issues from the fact that, in the social sciences, interpretive methods constitute the fundamental procedures of measurement and of the generation of research data relevant to theory. From our perspective, the standard, nonhermeneutic methods of quantitative social research can only be justified because they permit a shortcut in generating data (and research "economy" comes about under specific conditions). Whereas the conventional methodological attitude in the social sciences justifies qualitative approaches as exploratory or preparatory activities, to be succeeded by standardized approaches and techniques as the actual scientific procedures (assuring precision, validity, and objectivity), we regard hermeneutic procedures as the basic method for gaining precise and valid knowledge in the social sciences. However, we do not simply reject alternative approaches dogmatically. They are in fact useful wherever the loss in precision and objectivity necessitated by the requirement of research economy can be condoned and tolerated in the light of prior hermeneutically elucidated research experiences.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>

#### Other recent developments\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Other recent developments")\]

[Bernard Lonergan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Lonergan "Bernard Lonergan")'s (1904–1984) hermeneutics is less well known, but a case for considering his work as the culmination of the [postmodern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism "Postmodernism") hermeneutical revolution that began with Heidegger was made in several articles by Lonergan specialist [Frederick G. Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_G._Lawrence "Frederick G. Lawrence").<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>

[Paul Ricœur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ric%C5%93ur "Paul Ricœur") (1913–2005) developed a hermeneutics that is based upon Heidegger's concepts. His work differs in many ways from that of Gadamer.

[Karl-Otto Apel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Otto_Apel "Karl-Otto Apel") (b. 1922) elaborated a hermeneutics based on American [semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics "Semiotics"). He applied his model to [discourse ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_ethics "Discourse ethics") with political motivations akin to those of [critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory "Critical theory").

[Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas "Jürgen Habermas") (b. 1929) criticized the conservatism of previous hermeneutists, especially Gadamer, because their focus on tradition seemed to undermine possibilities for social criticism and transformation. He also criticized [Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism") and previous members of the [Frankfurt School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School "Frankfurt School") for missing the hermeneutical dimension of [critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory "Critical theory").

Habermas incorporated the notion of the [lifeworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeworld "Lifeworld") and emphasized the importance for social theory of interaction, communication, labor, and production. He viewed hermeneutics as a dimension of critical social theory.

[Rudolf Makkreel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Makkreel "Rudolf Makkreel") (b. 1939) has proposed an orientational hermeneutics that brings out the contextualizing function of reflective judgment. It extends ideas of [Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant "Kant") and [Dilthey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilthey "Dilthey") to supplement the dialogical approach of [Gadamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadamer "Gadamer") with a diagnostic approach that can deal with an ever-changing and multicultural world.

[Andrés Ortiz-Osés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Ortiz-Os%C3%A9s "Andrés Ortiz-Osés") (1943–2021) developed his [symbolic hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symbolic_hermeneutics&action=edit&redlink=1 "Symbolic hermeneutics (page does not exist)") as the [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Europe "Southern Europe") response to [Northern European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe "Northern Europe") hermeneutics. His main statement regarding symbolic understanding of the world is that [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(non-linguistic) "Meaning (non-linguistic)") is a [symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol "Symbol") healing of injury.

Two other important hermeneutic scholars are [Jean Grondin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Grondin "Jean Grondin") (b. 1955) and [Maurizio Ferraris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurizio_Ferraris "Maurizio Ferraris") (b. 1956).

Mauricio Beuchot coined the term and discipline of [analogic hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Analogic_hermeneutics&action=edit&redlink=1 "Analogic hermeneutics (page does not exist)"), which is a type of hermeneutics that is based upon interpretation and takes into account the plurality of aspects of meaning. He drew categories both from analytic and continental philosophy, as well as from the [history of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought "Thought").

Two scholars who have published criticism of Gadamer's hermeneutics are the Italian jurist [Emilio Betti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Betti "Emilio Betti") and the American literary theorist [E. D. Hirsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._Hirsch "E. D. Hirsch").

## Applications\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Applications")\]

### Archaeology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Archaeology")\]

In [archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology "Archaeology"), hermeneutics means the interpretation and understanding of material through analysis of possible meanings and social uses.

Proponents argue that interpretation of artifacts is unavoidably hermeneutic because we cannot know for certain the meaning behind them. We can only apply modern values when interpreting. This is most commonly seen in [stone tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_tool "Stone tool"), where descriptions such as "scraper" can be highly subjective and actually unproven until the development of [microwear analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwear_analysis "Microwear analysis") some thirty years ago.

Opponents argue that a hermeneutic approach is too [relativist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism "Relativism") and that their own interpretations are based on [common-sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense "Common sense") evaluation.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>

### Architecture\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Architecture")\]

There are several traditions of architectural scholarship that draw upon the hermeneutics of [Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidegger "Heidegger") and [Gadamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadamer "Gadamer"), such as [Christian Norberg-Schulz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Norberg-Schulz "Christian Norberg-Schulz"), and [Nader El-Bizri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nader_El-Bizri "Nader El-Bizri") in the circles of [phenomenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(architecture) "Phenomenology (architecture)"). Lindsay Jones examines the way architecture is received and how that reception changes with time and context (e.g., how a building is interpreted by critics, users, and historians).<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> [Dalibor Vesely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalibor_Vesely "Dalibor Vesely") situates hermeneutics within a critique of the application of overly scientific thinking to architecture.<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> This tradition fits within a critique of the [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment")<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> and has also informed design-studio teaching. [Adrian Snodgrass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Snodgrass "Adrian Snodgrass") sees the study of history and Asian cultures by architects as a hermeneutical encounter with otherness.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> He also deploys arguments from hermeneutics to explain design as a process of interpretation.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> Along with [Richard Coyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Coyne "Richard Coyne"), he extends the argument to the nature of architectural education and design.<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup>

### Education\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Education")\]

Hermeneutics motivates a broad range of applications in educational theory. The connection between hermeneutics and education has deep historical roots. The ancient Greeks gave the interpretation of poetry a central place in educational practice, as indicated by Dilthey: "systematic exegesis (_hermeneia_) of the poets developed out of the demands of the educational system."<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup>

Gadamer more recently wrote on the topic of education,<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> and more recent treatments of educational issues across various hermeneutical approaches are to be found in Fairfield<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> and Gallagher.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>

### Environment\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Environment")\]

[Environmental hermeneutics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_hermeneutics "Environmental hermeneutics") applies hermeneutics to environmental issues conceived broadly to subjects including "[nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature "Nature")" and "[wilderness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness "Wilderness")" (both terms are matters of hermeneutical contention), landscapes, ecosystems, built environments (where it overlaps architectural hermeneutics<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> ), inter-species relationships, the relationship of the body to the world, and more.

### International relations\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: International relations")\]

Insofar as hermeneutics is a basis of both [critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory "Critical theory") and [constitutive theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutive_theory "Constitutive theory") (both of which have made important inroads into the [postpositivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpositivism "Postpositivism") branch of [international relations theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations_theory "International relations theory") and [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science")), it has been applied to international relations.

[Steve Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_(academic) "Steve Smith (academic)") refers to hermeneutics as the principal way of grounding foundationalist yet postpositivist theory of [international relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations "International relations").

Radical [postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism "Postmodernism") is an example of a postpositivistanti-foundationalist [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm "Paradigm") of international relations.

### Law\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Law")\]

Some scholars argue that law and theology are particular forms of hermeneutics because of their need to interpret legal tradition or scriptural texts. Moreover, the problem of interpretation has been central to [legal theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law#Legal_theory "Law") since at least the 11th century.

In the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages") and [Italian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance "Italian Renaissance"), the schools of _[glossatores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossator "Glossator")_, _commentatores_, and _usus modernus_ distinguished themselves by their approach to the interpretation of "laws" (mainly [Justinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian "Justinian")'s [Corpus Juris Civilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Juris_Civilis "Corpus Juris Civilis")). The [University of Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bologna "University of Bologna") gave birth to a "legal Renaissance" in the 11th century, when the Corpus Juris Civilis was rediscovered and systematically studied by men such as [Irnerius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irnerius "Irnerius") and [Johannes Gratian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decretum_Gratiani#Author "Decretum Gratiani"). It was an interpretative Renaissance. Subsequently, these were fully developed by [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") and [Alberico Gentili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberico_Gentili "Alberico Gentili").

Since then, interpretation has always been at the center of legal thought. [Friedrich Carl von Savigny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Carl_von_Savigny "Friedrich Carl von Savigny") and [Emilio Betti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Betti "Emilio Betti"), among others, made significant contributions to general hermeneutics. [Legal interpretivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretivism_(legal) "Interpretivism (legal)"), most famously [Ronald Dworkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Dworkin "Ronald Dworkin")'s, may be seen as a branch of philosophical hermeneutics.

### Phenomenology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Phenomenology")\]

In [qualitative research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research "Qualitative research"), the beginnings of [phenomenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy) "Phenomenology (philosophy)") stem from German philosopher and researcher [Edmund Husserl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl "Edmund Husserl").<sup id="cite_ref-:02_69-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-:02-69">[69]</a></sup> In his early days, Husserl studied mathematics, but over time his disinterest with empirical methods led him to philosophy and eventually phenomenology. Husserl's phenomenology inquires on the specifics of a certain experience or experiences and attempts to unfold the meaning of experience in everyday life.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_69-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-:02-69">[69]</a></sup> Phenomenology started as philosophy and then developed into methodology over time. American researcher [Don Ihde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Ihde "Don Ihde") contributed to phenomenological research methodology through what he described as experimental phenomenology: “Phenomenology, in the first instance, is like an investigative science, an essential component of which is an experiment.”<sup id="cite_ref-:1_70-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-:1-70">[70]</a></sup> His work contributed heavily to the implementation of phenomenology as a methodology.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_70-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-:1-70">[70]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:2_71-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-:2-71">[71]</a></sup>

The beginnings of hermeneutic phenomenology stem from a German researcher and student of Husserl, [Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger "Martin Heidegger").<sup id="cite_ref-:02_69-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-:02-69">[69]</a></sup> Both researchers attempted to pull out the lived experiences of others through philosophical concepts, but Heidegger's main difference from Husserl was his belief that consciousness was not separate from the world but a formation of who we are as living individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_69-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-:02-69">[69]</a></sup> Hermeneutic phenomenology stresses that every event or encounter involves some type of interpretation from an individual's background, and that we cannot separate this from an individual's development through life.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_69-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-:02-69">[69]</a></sup> Ihde also focuses on hermeneutic phenomenology within his early work, and draws connections between Husserl and French philosopher [Paul Ricoeur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ric%C5%93ur "Paul Ricœur")'s work in the field.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_71-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-:2-71">[71]</a></sup> Ricoeur focuses on the importance of symbols and linguistics within hermeneutic phenomenology.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_71-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-:2-71">[71]</a></sup> Overall, hermeneutic phenomenological research focuses on historical meanings and experiences, and their developmental and social effects on individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup>

### Political philosophy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Political philosophy")\]

Italian philosopher [Gianni Vattimo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Vattimo "Gianni Vattimo") and Spanish philosopher [Santiago Zabala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Zabala "Santiago Zabala") in their book _[Hermeneutic Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_Communism "Hermeneutic Communism")_, when discussing contemporary capitalist regimes, stated that, "A politics of descriptions does not impose power in order to dominate as a philosophy; rather, it is functional for the continued existence of a society of dominion, which pursues truth in the form of imposition (violence), conservation (realism), and triumph (history)."<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup>

Vattimo and Zabala also stated that they view [interpretation as anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemological_anarchism "Epistemological anarchism") and affirmed that "existence is interpretation" and that "hermeneutics is weak thought."

### Psychoanalysis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Psychoanalysis")\]

Psychoanalysts have made ample use of hermeneutics since [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud") first gave birth to their discipline. In 1900 Freud wrote that the title he chose for _[The Interpretation of Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interpretation_of_Dreams "The Interpretation of Dreams")_ 'makes plain which of the traditional approaches to the problem of dreams I am inclined to follow...\[_i.e._\] "interpreting" a dream implies assigning a "meaning" to it.'<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>

The French psychoanalyst [Jacques Lacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan "Jacques Lacan") later extended Freudian hermeneutics into other psychical realms. His early work from the 1930s–50s is particularly influenced by Heidegger, and [Maurice Merleau-Ponty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Merleau-Ponty "Maurice Merleau-Ponty")'s hermeneutical phenomenology.

### Psychology and cognitive science\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Psychology and cognitive science")\]

[Psychologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist "Psychologist") and [Cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science") have recently become interested in hermeneutics, especially as an alternative to [cognitivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitivism_(psychology) "Cognitivism (psychology)").<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup>

[Hubert Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus "Hubert Dreyfus")'s critique of conventional [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") has been influential among psychologists who are interested in hermeneutic approaches to meaning and interpretation, as discussed by philosophers such as [Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger "Martin Heidegger") (cf. [Embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition "Embodied cognition")) and [Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein "Ludwig Wittgenstein") (cf. [Discursive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discursive_psychology "Discursive psychology")).

Hermeneutics is also influential in [humanistic psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology "Humanistic psychology").<sup id="cite_ref-Rennie_76-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Rennie-76">[76]</a></sup>

### Religion and theology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: Religion and theology")\]

The understanding of a [theological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology") [text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature "Literature") depends upon the reader's particular hermeneutical viewpoint. Some theorists, such as [Paul Ricœur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ric%C5%93ur "Paul Ricœur"), have applied modern philosophical hermeneutics to theological texts (in Ricœur's case, the Bible).

[Mircea Eliade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade "Mircea Eliade"), as a hermeneutist, understands religion as 'experience of the sacred', and interprets the sacred in relation to the profane.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> The Romanian scholar underlines that the relation between the sacred and the profane is not of opposition, but of complementarity, having interpreted the profane as a [hierophany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierophany "Hierophany").<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> The hermeneutics of the myth is a part of the hermeneutics of religion. Myth should not be interpreted as an illusion or a lie, because there is truth in myth to be rediscovered.<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> Myth is interpreted by Mircea Eliade as 'sacred history'. He introduces the concept of 'total hermeneutics'.<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup>

### Safety science\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Safety science")\]

In the field of safety science, and especially in the study of [human reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_reliability "Human reliability"), scientists have become increasingly interested in hermeneutic approaches.

It has been proposed by [ergonomist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics "Human factors and ergonomics") Donald Taylor that [mechanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_philosophy "Mechanical philosophy") models of human behaviour will only take us so far in terms of accident reduction, and that safety science must look at the meaning of accidents for human beings.<sup id="cite_ref-Taylor_81-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Taylor-81">[81]</a></sup>

Other scholars in the field have attempted to create safety [taxonomies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(general) "Taxonomy (general)") that make use of hermeneutic concepts in terms of their categorisation of [qualitative data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_data "Qualitative data").<sup id="cite_ref-Wallace_82-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-Wallace-82">[82]</a></sup>

### Sociology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Sociology")\]

In [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), hermeneutics is the interpretation and understanding of social events through analysis of their meanings for the human participants in the events. It enjoyed prominence during the 1960s and 1970s, and differs from other interpretive schools of sociology in that it emphasizes both context<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> and form within any given social behaviour.

The central principle of sociological hermeneutics is that it is only possible to know the meaning of an act or statement within the context of the discourse or [world view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_view "World view") from which it originates. Context is critical to comprehension; an action or event that carries substantial weight to one person or culture may be viewed as meaningless or entirely different to another. For example, giving the "thumbs-up" gesture is widely accepted as a sign of a job well done in the United States, while other cultures view it as an insult.<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> Similarly, marking a piece of paper and putting it into a box might be considered a meaningless act unless it is put into the context of an election (the act of putting a [ballot paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot "Ballot") into a box).

[Friedrich Schleiermacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schleiermacher "Friedrich Schleiermacher"), widely regarded as the father of sociological hermeneutics believed that, in order for an interpreter to understand the work of another author, they must familiarize themselves with the historical context in which the author published their thoughts. His work led to the inspiration of Heidegger's "[hermeneutic circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle "Hermeneutic circle")" a frequently referenced model that claims one's understanding of individual parts of a text is based on their understanding of the whole text, while the understanding of the whole text is dependent on the understanding of each individual part.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> Hermeneutics in sociology was also heavily influenced by German philosopher [Hans-Georg Gadamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Georg_Gadamer "Hans-Georg Gadamer").<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>

## Criticism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hermeneutics&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Criticism")\]

[Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas "Jürgen Habermas") criticizes [Gadamer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Georg_Gadamer "Hans-Georg Gadamer") hermeneutics as being unsuitable for understanding society because it is unable to account for questions of social reality, like labor and domination.<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>
