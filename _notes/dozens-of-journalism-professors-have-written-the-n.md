## Dozens of journalism professors have written the New York Times demanding an investigation into the paper's controversial article about sexual violence committed on October 7. Many, including people inside the Times, have questioned key elements of the story.

"Basically, after this particular article screams without words how Hamas weaponized sexual violence on October 7th came out,
there have been numerous reports that have debunked its primary claims.
And several journalism professors started to talk about what it means for the New York Times to run a piece like this,
even though its key claims have been debunked.
It was very troubling to professors of journalism to see such a shoddy article be published without a retraction or an investigation.
And so it became important for us to write this letter and to send it to the New York Times.
It's very important to take women seriously.
But I will say this, that this is also a piece of propaganda, right?
Because it draws from a narrative that has a much longer history in settler colonial societies where sexual violence, alleged sexual violence against particularly white women, becomes the basis for genocide.
This is true in the United States. Scholars have documented this and researched this quite well.
How the alleged rape of white women became the basis from which to slaughter indigenous people, to slaughter Native Americans.
This was used also against African Americans. Frederick Douglass talks about the myth of the black rapist where alleged sexual violence by black men was used to justify mass lynchings.
And unfortunately this piece in the New York Times is really the latest iteration of this longer narrative that then serves to justify violence. "
