From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), and [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology"), **intersubjectivity** is the [relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_(philosophy) "Relations (philosophy)") or [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection "Intersection") between people's [cognitive perspectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive) "Perspective (cognitive)").

## Definition\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intersubjectivity&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Definition")\]

_Intersubjectivity_ is a term coined by social scientists to refer to a variety of types of human interaction. The term was introduced to psychoanalysis by [George E. Atwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._Atwood "George E. Atwood") and [Robert Stolorow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stolorow "Robert Stolorow"), who consider it a "meta-theory" of psychoanalysis.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> For example, social psychologists [Alex Gillespie](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alex_Gillespie&action=edit&redlink=1 "Alex Gillespie (page does not exist)") and [Flora Cornish](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flora_Cornish&action=edit&redlink=1 "Flora Cornish (page does not exist)") listed at least seven definitions of intersubjectivity (and other disciplines have additional definitions):

-   people's agreement on the shared definition of a concept;
-   people's mutual awareness of agreement or disagreement, or of understanding or misunderstanding each other;
-   people's attribution of intentionality, feelings, and beliefs to each other;
-   people's implicit or automatic behavioral orientations towards other people;
-   people's interactive performance within a situation;
-   people's shared and taken-for-granted background assumptions, whether consensual or contested; and
-   "the variety of possible relations between people's perspectives".<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

_Intersubjectivity_ has been used in social science to refer to agreement. There is intersubjectivity between people if they agree on a given set of meanings or share the same perception of a situation. Similarly, [Thomas Scheff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Scheff "Thomas J. Scheff") defines _intersubjectivity_ as "the sharing of subjective states by two or more individuals".<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

_Intersubjectivity_ also has been used to refer to the [common-sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense "Common sense"), shared meanings constructed by people in their interactions with each other and used as an everyday resource to interpret the meaning of elements of social and cultural life. If people share common sense, then they share a definition of the situation.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

Psychoanalyst Jessica Benjamin, in _The Bonds of Love_, wrote, "The concept of intersubjectivity has its origins in the social theory of [Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas "Jürgen Habermas") (1970), who used the expression 'the intersubjectivity of mutual understanding' to designate an individual capacity and a social domain."<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 19">: 19 </span></sup>  Psychoanalyst Molly Macdonald argued in 2011 that a "potential point of origin" for the term was in [Jean Hyppolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Hyppolite "Jean Hyppolite")'s use of _l'inter-subjectivité_ in an essay from 1955 on "The Human Situation in the Hegelian Phenomenology".<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> However, the phenomenologist [Edmund Husserl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl "Edmund Husserl"), whose work Habermas and Hyppolite draw upon, was the first to develop the term, which was subsequently elaborated upon by other phenomenologists such as [Edith Stein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Stein "Edith Stein"), [Emmanuel Levinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Levinas "Emmanuel Levinas"), and [Maurice Merleau-Ponty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Merleau-Ponty "Maurice Merleau-Ponty").

## Philosophy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intersubjectivity&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Philosophy")\]

Contemporarily, intersubjectivity is the major topic in both the [analytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy "Analytic philosophy") and the [continental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_philosophy "Continental philosophy") traditions of philosophy. Intersubjectivity is considered crucial not only at the relational level but also at the epistemological and even metaphysical levels. For example, intersubjectivity is postulated as playing a role in establishing the truth of propositions, and constituting the so-called objectivity of objects.

A central concern in consciousness studies of the past 50 years is the so-called problem of _other minds,_ which asks how we can justify our belief that people have minds much like our own and predict others' mind-states and behavior, as our experience shows we often can.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Contemporary philosophical theories of intersubjectivity need to address the problem of other minds.

In the debate between cognitive individualism and cognitive universalism, some aspects of thinking are neither solely personal nor fully universal. Cognitive sociology proponents argue for _intersubjectivity_—an intermediate perspective of social cognition that provides a balanced view between personal and universal views of our social cognition. This approach suggests that, instead of being individual or universal thinkers, human beings subscribe to "thought communities"—communities of differing beliefs. Thought community examples include churches, professions, scientific beliefs, generations, nations, and political movements.<sup id="cite_ref-Zerubavel_1997_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Zerubavel_1997-8">[8]</a></sup> This perspective explains why each individual thinks differently from another (individualism): person A may choose to adhere to expiry dates on foods, but person B may believe that expiry dates are only guidelines and it is still safe to eat the food days past the expiry date. But not all human beings think the same way (universalism).

Intersubjectivity argues that each thought community shares social experiences that are different from the social experiences of other thought communities, creating differing beliefs among people who subscribe to different thought communities. These experiences transcend our subjectivity, which explains why they can be shared by the entire thought community.<sup id="cite_ref-Zerubavel_1997_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Zerubavel_1997-8">[8]</a></sup> Proponents of intersubjectivity support the view that individual beliefs are often the result of thought community beliefs, not just personal experiences or universal and objective human beliefs. Beliefs are recast in terms of standards, which are set by thought communities.

### Phenomenology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intersubjectivity&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Phenomenology")\]

[Edmund Husserl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl "Edmund Husserl"), the founder of [phenomenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy) "Phenomenology (philosophy)"), recognized the importance of intersubjectivity, and wrote extensively on the topic. In German, his writings on intersubjectivity are gathered in volumes 13–15 of the _[Husserliana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husserliana "Husserliana")_. In English, his best-known text on intersubjectivity is the _[Cartesian Meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_Meditations "Cartesian Meditations")_ (it is this text that features solely in the Husserl reader entitled _The Essential Husserl_). Although Husserlian phenomenology is often charged with methodological [solipsism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism "Solipsism"), in the fifth Cartesian Meditation, Husserl attempts to grapple with the problem of intersubjectivity and puts forward his theory of transcendental, monadological intersubjectivity.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

Husserl's student [Edith Stein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Stein "Edith Stein") extended intersubjectivity's basis in empathy in her 1917 doctoral dissertation, _On the Problem of Empathy_ (_Zum Problem der Einfühlung_).

Intersubjectivity also helps to constitute objectivity: in the experience of the world as available not only to oneself, but also to the other, there is a bridge between the personal and the shared, the self and the others.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

## Psychology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intersubjectivity&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Psychology")\]

Discussions and theories of intersubjectivity are prominent and of importance in contemporary psychology, theory of mind, and consciousness studies. Three major contemporary theories of intersubjectivity are theory theory, simulation theory, and interaction theory.

Shannon Spaulding, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at [Oklahoma State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_University "Oklahoma State University"), wrote:

> Theory theorists argue that we explain and predict behaviour by employing folk psychological theories about how mental states inform behaviour. With our folk psychological theories, we infer from a target's behaviour what his or her mental states probably are. And from these inferences, plus the psychological principles in the theory connecting mental states to behavior, we predict the target's behaviour (Carruthers and Smith 1996; Davies and Stone 1995a; Gopnik and Wellman 1992; Nichols and Stich 2003).<sup id="cite_ref-Spaulding_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Spaulding-10">[10]</a></sup>

[Simulation theorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_theory_of_empathy "Simulation theory of empathy"), on the other hand, claim that we explain and predict others' behaviour by using our own minds as a model and "putting ourselves in another's shoes"—that is, by imagining what our mental states would be and how we would behave if we were in the other's situation. More specifically, we simulate what the other's mental states could have been to cause the observed behaviour, then use the simulated mental states, pretend beliefs, and pretend desires as input, running them through our own decision-making mechanism. We then take the resulting conclusion and attribute it to the other person.<sup id="cite_ref-Spaulding_10-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Spaulding-10">[10]</a></sup> Authors like [Vittorio Gallese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Gallese "Vittorio Gallese") have proposed a theory of embodied simulation that refers to neuroscientific research on mirror neurons and phenomenological research.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

Spaulding noted that this debate has stalled in the past few years, with progress limited to articulating various hybrid simulation theories—"theory theory" accounts.<sup id="cite_ref-Spaulding_10-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Spaulding-10">[10]</a></sup> To resolve this impasse, authors like [Shaun Gallagher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaun_Gallagher "Shaun Gallagher") put forward interaction theory. Gallagher writes that an "... important shift is taking place in social cognition research, away from a focus on the individual mind and toward ... participatory aspects of social understanding...." Interaction theory is put forward to "galvanize" the interactive turn in explanations of intersubjectivity.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Gallagher defines an interaction as two or more autonomous agents engaged in co-regulated coupling behavior. For example, when walking a dog, both the owner's behavior is regulated by the dog stopping and sniffing, and the dog's behavior is regulated by the lead and the owner's commands. Ergo, walking the dog is an example of an interactive process. For Gallagher, interaction and direct perception constitute what he terms "primary" (or basic) intersubjectivity.

Studies of dialogue and [dialogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogism "Dialogism") reveal how language is deeply intersubjective. When we speak, we always address our interlocutors, taking their perspective and orienting to what we think they think (or, more often, don't think).<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Within this tradition of research, it has been argued that the structure of individual signs or symbols, the basis of language, is intersubjective<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> and that the psychological process of self-reflection entails intersubjectivity.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Recent research on [mirror neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neurons "Mirror neurons") provides evidence for the deeply intersubjective basis of human psychology,<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> and arguably much of the literature on [empathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy "Empathy") and [theory of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind "Theory of mind") relates directly to intersubjectivity.

## In child development\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intersubjectivity&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: In child development")\]

[Colwyn Trevarthen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colwyn_Trevarthen "Colwyn Trevarthen") has applied intersubjectivity to the very rapid cultural development of new born infants.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Research suggests that as babies, humans are biologically wired to "coordinate their actions with others".<sup id="cite_ref-Stone_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Stone-18">[18]</a></sup> This ability to coordinate and sync with others facilitates cognitive and emotional learning through social interaction. Additionally, the most socially productive relationship between children and adults is bidirectional, where both parties actively define a shared culture.<sup id="cite_ref-Stone_18-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Stone-18">[18]</a></sup> The bidirectional aspect lets the active parties organize the relationship how they see fit—what they see as important receives the most focus. Emphasis is placed on the idea that children are actively involved in how they learn, using intersubjectivity.<sup id="cite_ref-Stone_18-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Stone-18">[18]</a></sup>

### Across cultures\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intersubjectivity&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Across cultures")\]

The ways intersubjectivity occurs varies across cultures. In certain Indigenous American communities, [nonverbal communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication "Nonverbal communication") is so prevalent that intersubjectivity may occur regularly amongst all members of the community, in part perhaps due to a "joint cultural understanding" and a history of shared endeavors.<sup id="cite_ref-Correa-Chavez_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Correa-Chavez-19">[19]</a></sup> This "joint cultural understanding" may develop in small, Indigenous American communities where children have grown up embedded in their community's values, expectations, and livelihoods—learning through participation with adults rather than through intent verbal instruction—working in cohesion with one another in shared endeavors on a daily basis. Having grown up within this context may have led to members of this community to have what is described by some as a "blending of agendas",<sup id="cite_ref-Correa-Chavez_19-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Correa-Chavez-19">[19]</a></sup> or by others as a "dovetailing of motives".<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> If community or family members have the same general goals in mind they may thus act cohesively within an overlapping state of mind. Whether persons are in each other's presence or merely within the same community this blending of agendas or dovetailing of motives enables intersubjectivity to occur within these shared endeavors.<sup id="cite_ref-Correa-Chavez_19-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Correa-Chavez-19">[19]</a></sup>

The cultural value of _respeto_ may also contribute to intersubjectivity in some communities; unlike the English definition of 'respect', _respeto_ refers loosely to a mutual consideration for others' activities, needs, wants, etc.<sup id="cite_ref-Correa-Chavez_19-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Correa-Chavez-19">[19]</a></sup> Similar to "putting yourself in another's shoes" the prevalence of _respeto_ in certain Indigenous American communities in Mexico and South America may promote intersubjectivity as persons act in accordance with one another within consideration for the community or the individual's current needs or state of mind.

Shared reference during an activity facilitates learning. Adults either teach by doing the task with children, or by directing attention toward experts. Children that had to ask questions in regard to how to perform a task were scolded for not learning by another's example, as though they were ignoring the available resources to learn a task, as seen in [Tz'utujil Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz%27utujil_people "Tz'utujil people") parents who scolded questioning children and asking "if they had eyes".<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

Children from the [Chillihuani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%27illiwani "Ch'illiwani") village in the Andean mountains learned to [weave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving "Weaving") without explicit instruction. They learned the basic technique from others by observing, eager to participate in their community. The learning process was facilitated by watching adults and by being allowed to play and experiment using tools to create their own weaving techniques.<sup id="cite_ref-Bolin_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity#cite_note-Bolin-22">[22]</a></sup>
