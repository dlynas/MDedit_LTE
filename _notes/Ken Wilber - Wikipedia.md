**Kenneth Earl Wilber II** (born January 31, 1949) is an American theorist and writer on [transpersonal psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpersonal_psychology "Transpersonal psychology") and his own [integral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber) "Integral theory (Ken Wilber)"),<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> a four-quadrant grid which purports to encompass all human knowledge and experience.<sup id="cite_ref-wilber-intro_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-wilber-intro-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Life and career\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Wilber&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Life and career")\]

Wilber was born in 1949 in Oklahoma City. In 1967 he enrolled as a [pre-med](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-medical "Pre-medical") student at [Duke University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University "Duke University").<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> He became interested in psychology and Eastern spirituality. He left Duke and enrolled at the [University of Nebraska at Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nebraska_at_Lincoln "University of Nebraska at Lincoln") studying biochemistry, but after a few years dropped out of university and began studying his own curriculum and writing.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

In 1973 Wilber completed his first book, _The Spectrum of Consciousness_,<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> in which he sought to integrate knowledge from disparate fields. After rejections by more than 20 publishers it was accepted in 1977 by [Quest Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_Books "Quest Books"), and he spent a year giving lectures and workshops before going back to writing, publishing _The Atman Project_, in which he put his idea of a spectrum of consciousness in a developmental context. He also helped to launch the journal _ReVision_ in 1978.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

In 1982, New Science Library published his anthology _The Holographic Paradigm and Other Paradoxes_,<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> a collection of essays and interviews, including one by [David Bohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bohm "David Bohm"). The essays, including one of his own, looked at how [holography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography "Holography") and the [holographic paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_paradigm "Holographic paradigm") relate to the fields of consciousness, mysticism, and science.

In 1983, Wilber married Terry "Treya" Killam who was shortly thereafter diagnosed with breast cancer. From 1984 until 1987, Wilber gave up most of his writing to care for her. Killam died in January 1989; their joint experience was recorded in the 1991 book _Grace and Grit_.

In 1987, Wilber moved to [Boulder, Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado "Boulder, Colorado"), where he worked on his Kosmos trilogy and supervised the work and functioning of the [Integral Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_Institute "Integral Institute").<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

Wilber wrote _[Sex, Ecology, Spirituality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex,_Ecology,_Spirituality "Sex, Ecology, Spirituality")_ (1995), the first volume of his _Kosmos Trilogy_, presenting his "theory of everything," a four-quadrant grid in which he summarized his reading in psychology and Eastern and Western philosophy up to that time. _A Brief History of Everything_ (1996) was the popularised summary of _Sex, Ecology, Spirituality_ in interview format. _The Eye of Spirit_ (1997) was a compilation of articles he had written for the journal _ReVision_ on the relationship between science and religion. Throughout 1997, he had kept journals of his personal experiences, which were published in 1999 as _One Taste_, a term for [unitary consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_consciousness "Cosmic consciousness"). Over the next two years his publisher, [Shambhala Publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambhala_Publications "Shambhala Publications"), released eight re-edited volumes of his _Collected Works_. In 1999, he finished _Integral Psychology_ and wrote _[A Theory of Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Everything "A Theory of Everything")_ (2000). In _A Theory of Everything_ Wilber attempts to bridge business, politics, science and spirituality and show how they integrate with theories of developmental psychology, such as [Spiral Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics "Spiral Dynamics"). His novel, _[Boomeritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomeritis "Boomeritis")_ (2002), attempts to expose what he perceives as the [egotism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egotism "Egotism") of the [baby boom generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers "Baby boomers"). Frank Visser's _Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion_ (2003), a guide to Wilber's thought, was praised by Edward J. Sullivan<sup id="cite_ref-Sullivan_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-Sullivan-9">[9]</a></sup> and Daryl S. Paulson, with the latter calling it "an outstanding synthesis of Wilber's published works through the evolution of his thoughts over time. The book will be of value to any transpersonal humanist or integral philosophy student who does not want to read all of Wilber's works to understand his message."<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

In 2012, Wilber joined the [advisory board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_board "Advisory board") of the [International Simultaneous Policy Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Simultaneous_Policy_Organization "International Simultaneous Policy Organization") which seeks to end the usual deadlock in tackling global issues through an international simultaneous policy.<sup id="cite_ref-About_Simpol-UK_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-About_Simpol-UK-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Endorsements_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-Endorsements-12">[12]</a></sup>

Wilber stated in 2011 that he has long suffered from [chronic fatigue syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome "Chronic fatigue syndrome"), possibly caused by [RNase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNase "RNase") enzyme deficiency disease.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

All Quadrants All Levels (AQAL, pron. "ah-qwul") is the basic framework of integral theory. It models human knowledge and experience with a four-quadrant grid, along the axes of "interior-exterior" and "individual-collective". According to Wilber, it is a comprehensive approach to reality, a metatheory that attempts to explain how academic disciplines and every form of knowledge and experience fit together coherently.<sup id="cite_ref-wilber-intro_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-wilber-intro-2">[2]</a></sup>

AQAL is based on four fundamental concepts and a rest-category: four quadrants, several levels and lines of development, several states of consciousness, and "types", topics which do not fit into these four concepts.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> "Levels" are the stages of development, from pre-personal through personal to transpersonal. "Lines" of development are various domains which may progress unevenly through different stages .<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-16">[note 1]</a></sup> "States" are states of consciousness; according to Wilber persons may have a temporal experience of a higher developmental stage.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-17">[note 2]</a></sup> "Types" is a rest-category, for phenomena which do not fit in the other four concepts.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-18">[16]</a></sup> In order for an account of the Kosmos to be complete, Wilber believes that it must include each of these five categories. For Wilber, only such an account can be accurately called "integral". In the essay, "Excerpt C: The Ways We Are in This Together", Wilber describes AQAL as "one suggested architecture of the Kosmos".<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-19">[17]</a></sup>

The model's apex is formless awareness, "the simple feeling of being", which is equated with a range of "ultimates" from a variety of eastern traditions. This formless awareness transcends the phenomenal world, which is ultimately only an appearance of some transcendental reality. According to Wilber, the AQAL categories — quadrants, lines, levels, states, and types – describe the relative truth of the [two truths doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine "Two truths doctrine") of [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism"). According to Wilber, none of them are true in an absolute sense. Only formless awareness, "the simple feeling of being",<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-20">[18]</a></sup> exists absolutely.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

## Other ideas\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Wilber&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Other ideas")\]

### Mysticism and the great chain of being\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Wilber&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Mysticism and the great chain of being")\]

One of Wilber's main interests is in mapping what he calls the "neo-perennial philosophy", an integration of some of the views of [mysticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism") typified by [Aldous Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley "Aldous Huxley")'s _[The Perennial Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perennial_Philosophy "The Perennial Philosophy")_ with an account of cosmic [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution") akin to that of the Indian mystic [Sri Aurobindo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Aurobindo "Sri Aurobindo"). He rejects most of the tenets of [Perennialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_philosophy "Perennial philosophy") and the associated anti-evolutionary view of history as a regression from past ages or [yugas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga "Yuga").<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-22">[19]</a></sup> Instead, he embraces a more traditionally Western notion of the [great chain of being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_chain_of_being "Great chain of being"). As in the work of [Jean Gebser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Gebser "Jean Gebser"), this great chain (or "nest") is ever-present while relatively unfolding throughout this material manifestation, although to Wilber "... the 'Great Nest' is actually just a vast [morphogenetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphic_field "Morphic field") of potentials ..." In agreement with [Mahayana Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana_Buddhism "Mahayana Buddhism"), and [Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta "Advaita Vedanta"), he believes that reality is ultimately a [nondual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondual "Nondual") union of [emptiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunyata "Sunyata") and [form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_form "Substantial form"), with form being innately subject to development over time.

### Theory of truth\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Wilber&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Theory of truth")\]

Wilber believes that the mystical traditions of the world provide access to, and knowledge of, a [transcendental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_(religion) "Transcendence (religion)") reality which is perennial, consistent throughout all times and cultures. This proposition underlies the whole of his conceptual edifice, and is an unquestioned assumption.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-24">[note 4]</a></sup> Wilber juxtaposes this generalization to plain materialism, presented as the main paradigm of regular science.<sup id="cite_ref-mystics_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-mystics-25">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-26">[quote 1]</a></sup>

In his later works, Wilber argues that manifest reality is composed of four domains, and that each domain, or "quadrant", has its own truth-standard, or test for validity:<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-27">[22]</a></sup>

-   "Interior individual/1st person": the subjective world, the individual subjective sphere;<sup id="cite_ref-Ken_Wilber_p._96_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-Ken_Wilber_p._96-28">[23]</a></sup>
-   "Interior collective/2nd person": the intersubjective space, the cultural background;<sup id="cite_ref-Ken_Wilber_p._96_28-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-Ken_Wilber_p._96-28">[23]</a></sup>
-   "Exterior individual/3rd person": the objective state of affairs;<sup id="cite_ref-Ken_Wilber_p._96_28-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-Ken_Wilber_p._96-28">[23]</a></sup>
-   "Exterior collective/3rd person": the functional fit, "how entities fit together in a system".<sup id="cite_ref-Ken_Wilber_p._96_28-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-Ken_Wilber_p._96-28">[23]</a></sup>

### Pre/trans fallacy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Wilber&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Pre/trans fallacy")\]

Wilber believes that many claims about non-rational states make a mistake he calls the pre/trans fallacy. According to Wilber, the non-rational stages of consciousness (what Wilber calls "pre-rational" and "trans-rational" stages) can be easily confused with one another. In Wilber's view, one can reduce trans-rational spiritual realization to pre-rational regression, or one can elevate pre-rational states to the trans-rational domain.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-29">[24]</a></sup> For example, Wilber claims that [Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud") and [Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung "Carl Jung") commit this fallacy. Freud considered mystical realization to be a [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_(psychology) "Regression (psychology)") to [infantile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantile "Infantile") oceanic states. Wilber alleges that Freud thus commits a fallacy of reduction. Wilber thinks that Jung commits the converse form of the same mistake by considering pre-rational myths to reflect divine realizations. Likewise, pre-rational states may be misidentified as post-rational states.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-30">[25]</a></sup> Wilber characterizes himself as having fallen victim to the pre/trans fallacy in his early work.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-31">[26]</a></sup>

### Wilber on science\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Wilber&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Wilber on science")\]

Wilber describes the state of the "hard" sciences as limited to "narrow science", which only allows evidence from the lowest realm of consciousness, the [sensorimotor](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sensorimotor "wikt:sensorimotor") (the five senses and their extensions). Wilber sees science in the broad sense as characterized by involving three steps:<sup id="cite_ref-RothbergKelly1998-p12_32-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-RothbergKelly1998-p12-32">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Howard2005-p2-3_33-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-Howard2005-p2-3-33">[28]</a></sup>

-   specifying an experiment,
-   performing the experiment and observing the results, and
-   checking the results with others who have competently performed the same experiment.

He has presented these as "three strands of valid knowledge" in Part III of his book _[The Marriage of Sense and Soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marriage_of_Sense_and_Soul "The Marriage of Sense and Soul")_.<sup id="cite_ref-Wilber2011-p187_34-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-Wilber2011-p187-34">[29]</a></sup>

What Wilber calls "broad science" would include evidence from [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), mathematics, and from the [symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol "Symbol"), [hermeneutical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics "Hermeneutics"), and other realms of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness"). Ultimately and ideally, broad science would include the testimony of [meditators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation "Meditation") and [spiritual practitioners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_practice "Spiritual practice"). Wilber's own conception of science includes both narrow science and broad science, e.g., using [electroencephalogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalogram "Electroencephalogram") machines and other technologies to test the experiences of meditators and other spiritual practitioners, creating what Wilber calls "integral science".<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2007)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

According to Wilber's theory, narrow science trumps narrow religion, but broad science trumps narrow science. That is, the natural sciences provide a more inclusive, accurate account of reality than any of the particular [exoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoteric "Exoteric") religious traditions. But an integral approach that uses intersubjectivity to evaluate both religious claims and scientific claims will give a more complete account of reality than narrow science.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2007)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Wilber has referred to [Stuart Kauffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman "Stuart Kauffman"), [Ilya Prigogine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine "Ilya Prigogine"), [Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead "Alfred North Whitehead"), and others who also articulate his [vitalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism "Vitalism") and [teleological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology "Teleology") understanding of reality, which is deeply at odds with the [modern evolutionary synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Darwinism "Neo-Darwinism").<sup id="cite_ref-SC_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-SC-35">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-36">[quote 2]</a></sup>

### Later work\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Wilber&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Later work")\]

In 2005, at the launch of the Integral Spiritual Center, a branch of the [Integral Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_Institute "Integral Institute"), Wilber presented a 118-page rough draft summary of his two forthcoming books.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-37">[31]</a></sup> The essay is entitled "What is Integral Spirituality?", and contains several new ideas, including Integral post-metaphysics and the Wilber-Combs lattice. In 2006, he published "Integral Spirituality", in which he elaborated on these ideas, as well as others such as Integral Methodological Pluralism and the developmental conveyor belt of religion.

"Integral post-metaphysics" is the term Wilber has given to his attempts to reconstruct the world's [spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality")\-religious traditions in a way that accounts for the [modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism "Modernism") and [post-modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-modern "Post-modern") criticisms of those traditions.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-38">[32]</a></sup>

The Wilber-Combs Lattice is a conceptual model of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") developed by Wilber and [Allan Combs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Combs "Allan Combs"). It is a grid with sequential [states of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_consciousness "States of consciousness") on the x axis (from left to right) and with developmental structures, or [levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_hierarchy "Overlapping hierarchy"), of consciousness on the y axis (from bottom to top). This lattice illustrates how each structure of consciousness interprets experiences of different states of consciousness, including mystical states, in different ways.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-39">[33]</a></sup>

Wilber attracted a lot of controversy from 2011 to the present day by supporting [Marc Gafni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gafni "Marc Gafni"), who was accused of sexually assaulting a minor,<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-40">[34]</a></sup> on his blog.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-41">[35]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-42">[36]</a></sup> A petition begun by a group of Rabbis has called for Wilber to publicly dissociate from Gafni.

Wilber is on the advisory board of Mariana Bozesan's AQAL Capital GmbH,<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-43">[37]</a></sup> a [Munich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich "Munich")\-based company specialising in integral [Impact Investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_Investing "Impact Investing") using a model based on Wilber's [Integral Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber) "Integral theory (Ken Wilber)").

## Influences\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Wilber&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Influences")\]

Wilber's views have been influenced by [Madhyamaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhyamaka "Madhyamaka") [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism"), particularly as articulated in the philosophy of [Nagarjuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna "Nagarjuna").<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-44">[38]</a></sup> Wilber has practiced various forms of Buddhist meditation, studying (however briefly) with a number of teachers, including [Dainin Katagiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dainin_Katagiri "Dainin Katagiri"), [Taizan Maezumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taizan_Maezumi "Taizan Maezumi"), [Chogyam Trungpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chogyam_Trungpa "Chogyam Trungpa") [Rinpoche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinpoche "Rinpoche"), [Kalu Rinpoche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalu_Rinpoche "Kalu Rinpoche"), [Alan Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts "Alan Watts"), [Penor Rinpoche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penor_Rinpoche "Penor Rinpoche") and [Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagdud_Tulku_Rinpoche "Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche"). [Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta "Advaita Vedanta"), [Trika (Kashmir) Shaivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka%C5%9Bmir_%C5%9Aaivism "Kaśmir Śaivism"), [Tibetan Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism "Tibetan Buddhism"), [Zen Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Buddhism "Zen Buddhism"), [Ramana Maharshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi "Ramana Maharshi"), and [Andrew Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cohen_(spiritual_teacher) "Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)") can be mentioned as further influences. Wilber has on several occasions singled out [Adi Da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Da "Adi Da")'s work for the highest praise while expressing reservations about Adi Da as a teacher.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-45">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-46">[40]</a></sup> In _Sex, Ecology, Spirituality_, Wilber refers extensively to [Plotinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotinus "Plotinus")' philosophy, which he sees as nondual. While Wilber has practised [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist "Buddhist") meditation methods, he does not identify himself as a Buddhist.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-47">[41]</a></sup>

According to Frank Visser, Wilber's conception of four quadrants, or dimensions of existence is very similar to [E. F. Schumacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._F._Schumacher "E. F. Schumacher")'s conception of four fields of knowledge.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-48">[42]</a></sup> Visser finds Wilber's conception of levels, as well as Wilber's critique of science as one-dimensional, to be very similar to that in [Huston Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huston_Smith "Huston Smith")'s _Forgotten Truth_.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-49">[43]</a></sup> Visser also writes that the esoteric aspects of Wilber's theory are based on the philosophy of [Sri Aurobindo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Aurobindo "Sri Aurobindo") as well as other theorists including [Adi Da](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Da "Adi Da").<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-50">[44]</a></sup>

## Reception\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Wilber&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Reception")\]

Wilber has been categorized by [Wouter J. Hanegraaff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wouter_J._Hanegraaff "Wouter J. Hanegraaff") as [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age "New Age") due to his emphasis on a [transpersonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpersonal "Transpersonal") view.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-51">[45]</a></sup> _Publishers Weekly_ has called him "the Hegel of Eastern spirituality".<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-52">[46]</a></sup>

Wilber is credited with broadening the appeal of a "perennial philosophy" to a much wider audience. Cultural figures as varied as [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton "Bill Clinton"),<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-53">[47]</a></sup> [Al Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore "Al Gore"), [Deepak Chopra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Chopra "Deepak Chopra"), [Richard Rohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rohr "Richard Rohr"),<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-54">[48]</a></sup> and musician [Billy Corgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Corgan "Billy Corgan") have mentioned his influence.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-55">[49]</a></sup> Paul M. Helfrich credits him with "precocious understanding that transcendental experience is not solely pathological, and properly developed could greatly inform human development".<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-56">[50]</a></sup> However, Wilber's approach has been criticized as excessively categorizing and [objectifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification "Objectification"), [masculinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculine "Masculine"),<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-57">[51]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-58">[52]</a></sup> commercializing spirituality,<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-59">[53]</a></sup> and denigrating of emotion.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-60">[54]</a></sup> Critics in multiple fields cite problems with Wilber's interpretations and inaccurate citations of his wide ranging sources, as well as stylistic issues with gratuitous repetition, excessive book length, and hyperbole.<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-61">[55]</a></sup>

Frank Visser writes that Wilber's 1977 book _The Spectrum of Consciousness_ was praised by [transpersonal psychologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpersonal_psychology "Transpersonal psychology"), but also that support for him "even in transpersonal circles" had waned by the early 1990s.<sup id="cite_ref-Sullivan_9-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-Sullivan-9">[9]</a></sup> Edward J. Sullivan argued, in his review of Visser's guide _Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion_, that in the field of composition studies "Wilber's melding of life’s journeys with abstract theorizing could provide an eclectic and challenging model of 'personal-academic' writing", but that "teachers of writing may be critical of his all-too-frequent totalizing assumptions".<sup id="cite_ref-Sullivan_9-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-Sullivan-9">[9]</a></sup> Sullivan also said that Visser's book overall gave an impression that Wilber "should think more and publish less."<sup id="cite_ref-Sullivan_9-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-Sullivan-9">[9]</a></sup>

[Steve McIntosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McIntosh "Steve McIntosh") praises Wilber's work but also argues that Wilber fails to distinguish "philosophy" from his own Vedantic and Buddhist religion.<sup id="cite_ref-McIntosh_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-McIntosh-62">[56]</a></sup> [Christopher Bache](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Bache&action=edit&redlink=1 "Christopher Bache (page does not exist)") is complimentary of some aspects of Wilber's work, but calls Wilber's writing style glib.<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-63">[57]</a></sup>

Psychiatrist [Stanislav Grof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Grof "Stanislav Grof") has praised Wilber's knowledge and work in the highest terms;<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-65">[note 5]</a></sup> however, Grof has criticized the omission of the [pre- and peri-natal domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-_and_perinatal_psychology "Pre- and perinatal psychology") from Wilber's spectrum of consciousness, and Wilber's neglect of the psychological importance of biological birth and death.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-66">[59]</a></sup> Grof has described Wilber's writings as having an "often aggressive polemical style that includes strongly worded _[ad personam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_personam "Ad personam")_ attacks and is not conducive to personal dialogue."<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-67">[60]</a></sup> Wilber's response is that the world religious traditions do not attest to the importance that Grof assigns to the perinatal.<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-68">[61]</a></sup>

## Notes\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Wilber&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Notes")\]

1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_ref-16 "Jump up")** This interpretation is at odds with [structural stage theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_stage_theory "Structural stage theory"), which posits an overall follow-up of stages, instead of variations over several domains.
2.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_ref-17 "Jump up")** This too is at odds with structural stage theory, but in line with Wilber's philosophical idealism, which sees the phenomenal world as a concretisation, or immanation, of a "higher," transcendental reality, which can be "realized" in "religious experience."
3.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_ref-21 "Jump up")** The [Madhyamaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhyamaka "Madhyamaka") two truths doctrine discerns two epistemological truths, namely conventional and ultimate. Conventional truth is the truth of phenomenal appearances and causal relations, our daily common-sense world. Ultimate truth is the recognition that no-"thing" exists inherently; every-"thing" is empty, [sunyata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunyata "Sunyata") of an unchanging "essence". It also means that there is no unchanging transcendental reality underlying phenomenal existence. "Formless awareness" belongs to another strand of Indian thinking, namely Advaita and Buddha-nature, which are ontological approaches, and _do_ posit such a transcendental, unchanging reality, namely "awareness" or "consciousness." Wilber seems to be mixing, or confusing, these two different approaches freely, in his attempt to integrate "everything" into one conceptual scheme.
4.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_ref-24 "Jump up")** The perennial position is "largely dismissed by scholars",<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMcMahan2008269,_note_9_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcMahan2008269,_note_9-23">[20]</a></sup> but "has lost none of its popularity".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMcMahan2008269,_note_9_23-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcMahan2008269,_note_9-23">[20]</a></sup> Mainstream academia favor a constructivist approach, which is rejected by Wilber as a dangerous relativism. See also [Perennialism versus constructionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism "Mysticism").
5.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_ref-65 "Jump up")** ... Ken has produced an extraordinary work of highly creative synthesis of data drawn from a vast variety of areas and disciplines ... His knowledge of the literature is truly encyclopedic, his analytical mind systematic and incisive, and the clarity of his logic remarkable. The impressive scope, comprehensive nature, and intellectual rigor of Ken's work have helped to make it a widely acclaimed and highly influential theory of transpersonal psychology.<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-64">[58]</a></sup>

## Quotes\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ken_Wilber&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Quotes")\]

1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_ref-26 "Jump up")** Wilber: "Are the mystics and sages insane? Because they all tell variations on the same story, don't they? The story of awakening one morning and discovering you are one with the All, in a timeless and eternal and infinite fashion. Yes, maybe they are crazy, these divine fools. Maybe they are mumbling idiots in the face of the Abyss. Maybe they need a nice, understanding therapist. Yes, I'm sure that would help. But then, I wonder. Maybe the evolutionary sequence really is from matter to body to mind to soul to spirit, each transcending and including, each with a greater depth and greater consciousness and wider embrace. And in the highest reaches of evolution, maybe, just maybe, an individual's consciousness does indeed touch infinity—a total embrace of the entire Kosmos—a [Kosmic consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_consciousness "Cosmic consciousness") that is Spirit awakened to its own true nature. It's at least plausible. And tell me: is that story, sung by mystics and sages the world over, any crazier than the [scientific materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_materialism "Scientific materialism") story, which is that the entire sequence is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing? Listen very carefully: just which of those two stories actually sounds totally insane?"<sup id="cite_ref-mystics_25-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-mystics-25">[21]</a></sup>
2.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_ref-36 "Jump up")** Wilber: "I am not alone in seeing that chance and natural selection by themselves are not enough to account for the emergence that we see in evolution. Stuart Kaufman \[_[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")_\] and many others have criticized mere change and natural selection as not adequate to account for this emergence (he sees the necessity of adding self-organization). Of course I understand that natural selection is not acting on mere randomness or chance—because natural selection saves previous selections, and this reduces dramatically the probability that higher, adequate forms will emerge. But even that is not enough, in my opinion, to account for the remarkable emergence of some of the extraordinarily complex forms that nature has produced. After all, from the big bang and dirt to the poems of William Shakespeare is quite a distance, and many philosophers of science agree that mere chance and selection are just not adequate to account for these remarkable emergences. The universe is slightly tilted toward self-organizing processes, and these processes—as Prigogine was the first to elaborate—escape present-level turmoil by jumping to higher levels of self-organization, and I see that "pressure" as operating throughout the physiosphere, the biosphere, and the noosphere. And that is what I metaphorically mean when I use the example of a wing (or elsewhere, the example of an eyeball) to indicate the remarkableness of increasing emergence. But I don't mean that as a specific model or actual example of how biological emergence works! Natural selection carries forth previous individual mutations—but again that just isn't enough to account for creative emergence (or what Whitehead called "the creative advance into novelty," which, according to Whitehead, is the fundamental nature of this manifest universe)."<sup id="cite_ref-SC_35-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#cite_note-SC-35">[30]</a></sup>
