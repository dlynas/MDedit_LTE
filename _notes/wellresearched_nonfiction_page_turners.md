	Not true crime, but Caitlin Doughty’s books: From Here To Eternity, Smoke Gets In Your Eyes, and Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs, are all very informative and interesting.

	* 🟨 **[DoesntReallyExist](https://www.reddit.com/user/DoesntReallyExist)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-01-03 21:37:58)_

		Seconded. I read Smoke Gets in your Eyes a few years ago and still think about it often. It's a super interesting look at an industry you don't hear much about, but it also made me reconsider my feelings about death in general. Interesting, informative, and impactful all in one

	* 🟨 **[SerDire](https://www.reddit.com/user/SerDire)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-01-03 17:52:10)_

		I’m about halfway done with Chernobyl and the first 50-75 pages are tough to get through because it’s just endless Russian nuclear history but once you get past that and enter the control room during that fateful day, it never stops. It’s a day by day account of what happens and I’m hooked.

	* 🟨 **[bibliophile563](https://www.reddit.com/user/bibliophile563)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-01-03 22:26:32)_

		Seconding midnight in Chernobyl.

	Endurance by Alfred Lansing about the failed Shackleton expedition is an absolutely phenomenal read. 

	I've almost finished In the Heart of the Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick. If you liked The Wager you'll enjoy this.

	* 🟨 **[luminary_uprise](https://www.reddit.com/user/luminary_uprise)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-01-03 14:14:49)_

	* 🟨 **[KWINAZ](https://www.reddit.com/user/KWINAZ)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-01-03 19:52:10)_

	Educated by Tara Westover

	One of the best books I read last year. I did not go to sleep until I finished it, I just could not force myself to close it.

	* 🟨 **[_withasmile_](https://www.reddit.com/user/_withasmile_)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-01-03 14:55:54)_

				* 🟪 **[superfl00f](https://www.reddit.com/user/superfl00f)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-01-04 01:39:11)_

					It doesn't go into as much detail as the book but has some amazing and sometimes very moving audio from key people in the case. Worth a listen even if you have read the book.

* 🟩 **[Disastrous_Chain7148](https://www.reddit.com/user/Disastrous_Chain7148)** ⬆️ 27 _(2024-01-03 09:54:27)_

	* 🟨 **[KingBlackthorn1](https://www.reddit.com/user/KingBlackthorn1)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-01-03 18:52:27)_

		This book made my stomach turn at times and made so insanely angry at other points. I am native, and honestly I never even heard about this stuff until I saw the trailer for the movie. I just finished the book on the Jan 1st and gods… such a painful read but such an amazing read. One of the best books I have ever read.

	* 🟨 **[AmetrineDream](https://www.reddit.com/user/AmetrineDream)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-01-03 15:19:25)_

		Also, if you liked *The Stranger Beside Me*, you’ll also like other Ann Rule books! My other favorites were *Small Sacrifices* (about Diane Downs) and *Green River Running Red* (about the Green River Killer, Gary Ridgeway)

		* 🟧 **[AmetrineDream](https://www.reddit.com/user/AmetrineDream)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-01-03 15:18:41)_

			*Every Breath You Take* by Anne Rule is fantastic, too. So sad. The victim loved Anne Rule and her ex husband had been stalking her for years. She asked her sister to have Anne Rule tell her story if her ex husband ended up murdering her and, well…

			* 🟦 **[Lost-Sea4916](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lost-Sea4916)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-01-03 15:38:26)_

		* 🟧 **[Davmilasav](https://www.reddit.com/user/Davmilasav)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-01-03 15:19:37)_

			I agree. I'm rereading "Isaac's Storm," which is about the hurricane that nearly wiped out Galveston, TX. It's well-written and a fascinating story. I learned a lot about the history of meteorology from the book.

* 🟩 **[Toastwich](https://www.reddit.com/user/Toastwich)** ⬆️ 9 _(2024-01-03 12:18:49)_

	{{The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story of the origins of the Ebola virus by Richard Preston}} is one of my favorites. It’s about the rise of the Ebola crisis in the late 80s/early 90s. It reads like a horror novel but is 100% nonfiction.

	* 🟨 **[goodreads-rebot](https://www.reddit.com/user/goodreads-rebot)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-01-03 12:20:05)_

	Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln’s Killer by James L. Swanson

	This is usually my go-to recommendation for people who aren’t “into history.” It reads like a crime thriller. Very fast-paced, well-written, and a fascinating story to boot!

	* 🟨 **[Due-Ad8230](https://www.reddit.com/user/Due-Ad8230)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-01-03 13:34:37)_

	Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper. Writen by Sunday Times journalist Michael Bilton.

	A fascinating read that follows the investigation, highlights attitudes to women by the police, police ineptitude, and explores how a review of the investigation led to a massive overhaul of British policing, including the implementation of IT to manage investigations. (Every piece of information  from this investigation was stored on a index card.)

	A Night To Remember by Walter Lord is a gripping, minute-by-minute account of the sinking of the Titanic. 

	Alive by Piers Paul Read recounts the story of a young rugby team's plane crash in the Andes and their fight for survival.

	- **Number Go Up** by Zeke Faux (amazing journey into the world of crypto, and much less fawning over SBF than Michael Lewis’ latest work)

	- **Bottoms Up and the Devil Laughs: A Journey Through the Deep State** by Kerry Howley (about how information is shuttled around various intelligence entities, using the case of Reality Winner as the throughline. One of NYT’s top 10 books of 2023)

	- **And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank** by Steve Oney. A true crime southern gothic based on a heart wrenching murder and the antisemitism that helped seal an innocent man’s fate.

	- **The Chaos Machine: The Inside Story of How Social Media Rewired Our Minds and Our World** by Max Fisher. When civilization rises again from its most recent downfall, some archaeologist is going to find this book, read it, and think “oooooh so *that’s* how they all destroyed themselves”.

	- **Dark Star Rising: Magick and Power in the Age of Trump** by Gary Lachman. Obviously don’t want to get into any crazy debates with strangers over politics, so please skip this one if it’s not a good fit. But, if you’re curious, this is a pretty interesting and fresh point of view - which is hard to find in our current political climate.

	- **A Death on W Street: The Murder of Seth Rich and the Age of Controversy** by Andy Kroll. Again, not trying to stir the political pot. But I did my undergrad capstone on QAnon and post-truth information systems. Seth Rich, Pizza Gate, and Gamer Gate were the three canaries in the coal mine, imho… the last three blinking red lights before total information ecosystem collapse. 

	- **The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner** by Daniel Ellsberg. Ellsberg is not a journalist. However, he is the person who leaked the Pentagon Papers, effectively ending the Vietnam War. What you may not know (I certainly didn’t until II read this book) is that he had also intended to do something similar with America’s nuclear war plans. Long story short, he lost all the classified papers he had collected to prove what he was saying was true. So he waited until 2017, when most or all of that information was declassified, and then wrote the story, which is very very very different than I thought it would be.

	I really like The diary of Lady Murasaki.

	It’s a diary of a writer who lived in the Heian period. She was the author of the Tale of Genji, written around 1000. It’s a page turner for me, I liked how she saw the world and I reread it multiple times. 

	It’s not for everyone though, I think.

	No Longer human by Osamu Dazai

	This is a semi-autobiographical book so it halfly fits your wishes. It’s a difficult story so be aware of it. He was not a happy person.

Great research, tracing from Renaissance times until the present, but never gets bogged down telling the exciting (and ultimately tragic) story of Michael Servetus, a scholar who made a brilliant medical discovery (which was credited to another researcher two hundred years later) and founded Unitarianism…for which he was burned at the stake, along with alllllmost all of his books.
