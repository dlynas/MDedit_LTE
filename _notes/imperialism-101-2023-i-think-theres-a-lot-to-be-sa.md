## ‘𝘐𝘮𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘢𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘮: 𝟣𝟢𝟣’ (2023) 

I think there’s a lot to be said about the ongoing genocides happening in Sudan, Haiti, Congo & Palestine (and more)

Unfortunately, the majority of which is being said, is only in favor to Palestine…. 

I’m curious as to why? 
Have you stopped to ask yourself why? 

These illustrations aren’t meant to place one crisis over the other, but to simply shed light on something that isn’t getting fair media coverage. 

All I’m saying is, we should either discuss them all or nothing at all. 

imperialism • (/ɪmˈpɪərɪəlɪz(ə)m/) is the thread that connects all genocidic struggles from sea to sea. It’s the very thing that can turn one’s neighbor into their oppressor.

I hope everyone who sees these illustrations can also go the extra mile to research not only what’s happening in Palestine & Congo, but also what’s happening in all the other countries that are (and have been) gravely affected by imperialist apartheid.

From the river….to the sea….
