## Are you surprised they are laughing at us together? Colluding to silence voices that call for liberation for Palestinians from the sea to the Jordan river, a phrase taken from the Israeli Likud party platform?

When Israelis use it, they are referring to complete domination of a native population, subjecting, millions of Palestinians to collective punishment, apartheid and oppressive occupation on native land.

When Palestinians use it in the context of “Palestine will be free” they are referring to the liberation of their people on their land which Israel has been occupying and annexing for 75 years as they continue to annexx more land despite the so-called peace deals that stipulate no more annexation and illegal settlement building.

That Elon musk would proudly announce this decision should tell you a lot about where he stands on apartheid and occupation now, as a beneficiary from apartheid in South Africa. 

Elon’s dad Errol owned an emerald mine in South Africa. The mine was profitable and made the family wealthy beyond imagination.

The family didn’t own the mine through their tireless work. The ownership was the result of racist laws and policies that allowed white Europeans in South Africa exclusive access to the natural and human resources of the country.

When he bought the mine in 1980, only whites in South Africa were allowed to own mines. 

Apartheid created a system where South Africa’s wealth was totally concentrated in the hands of Europeans like Errol Musk.

Apartheid laws and policies barred South Africans from benefiting from their own natural and Human Resources. 

As Israeli laws do today.

Instead, non-Africans like the Musk family were given privileged access to exploit natural resources.

Whites in South Africa were allowed to exploit the human resources of South Africa.

Europeans like the Musk family made millions while the real South Africans lived in abject poverty. Europeans like Errol Musk made millions stealing the wealth and resources of South Africa and South Africans.
