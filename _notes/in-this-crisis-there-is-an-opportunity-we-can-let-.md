## in this crisis there is an opportunity. we can let this moment pass just like the mass protests against the Iraq war in 2003 or the George Floyd uprising in the summer of 2020. or we can turn this moment into a sustained, long term, disciplined, and sustainably organized movement that can continue to put pressure on the imperialist machine well into the future. we don't have much time. we also can't expect immediate results. direct actions are important and, significantly, very cathartic. but in order to find success the left in the United States is going to have to rally around a singular party that can coordinate all of the disparate events under one umbrella and utilize a wide variety of tactics from direct action to electoralism. if you don't know where to start, go to the closest rally happening and talk to the person giving out the fliers. @pslnational are doing fantastic work, but they're not the only ones out there. âœŠ

	"When we're trying to not get tenants evicted, when we're giving mutual aid, when we're feeding
	giving school supplies to kids in our community, that's great, but it's literally playing
	defense.
	We're trying to, you know, cover up or deal with some of the problems of living in capitalism.
	We're not taking the fight to anybody at all.
	If you're on the ground feeding people in your community, salute to you.
	If you're on the ground fighting for tenants' rights and getting deposits back and taking
	on slum boards, salute to you.
	You are the sort of seed bed out of which a Vanguard party can possibly grow, but we're
	just saying we're not there yet.
	And that's the fundamental task because the crises are going to keep coming, but if we're
	not organized, those crises, they'll leave us scrambling to play mere defense and will
	never be able to go on the offensive.
	And so the task of every Communist in the United States right now is to begin working toward
	a real Vanguard party.
	Listen to our full conversation with Greto Che and Allison Escalante, anywhere you listen
	to your favorite podcasts."
