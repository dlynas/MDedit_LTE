	**The Selfish Gene** was a book that changed my views on life - but *not* because of the genetics or the biology. 

	It's because of Chapter 12 of the 1989 revised edition of this book, entitled "**Nice guys finish first**". This is one of the two chapters that Dawkins added for this revised edition. 

	This chapter is about the [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma), which is a famous game used in game theory. In the game, each player chooses to cooperate or defect (*without* communicating with the other player!), and both players are rewarded or punished depending on the interaction of both players' decisions. The rewards and punishments are arranged in such a way that both players get punished if both players defect, both players get rewarded if both players cooperate, but a player gets the highest possible reward if they defect while the other player cooperates. In particular, "**Nice guys finish first**" is about an *iterated* version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, where two players keep playing the game repeatedly with each other - and can use their memory of prior rounds to influence their decision in future rounds. 

	In this chapter, Dawkins describes a computer programming tournament based on the Prisoner's Dilemma, where programmers were invited to create programs which would play the iterated game against other programs. (This tournament is also covered in [this YouTube video I watched recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM).) Each program had its own strategy. Some were cooperative, some were non-cooperative, some were nice, some were nasty, and so on. The challenge was to devise a strategy that would win most consistently against all other strategies. The organiser paired each program with all other programs in a round-robin format, played them against each other repeatedly, and determined which program gained the most rewards overall. 

	Surprisingly, the most successful program was *nice* and *forgiving*. It was called Tit For Tat. It started out by cooperating as its default choice. As long as the program it was paired with cooperated, Tit For Tat kept cooperating. If the other program defected in one game, Tit For Tat would defect in the next game, but only that one time, before reverting to cooperating in the game after that, until the other program defected again, in which case Tit For Tat would defect in the next game, and then again revert to cooperating in the game after that, and so on. 

	This strategy consistently achieved the most rewards against *all other strategies*, even the nastiest, most defection-oriented strategies. They even ran the tournament a second time, and invited more programmers to submit more programs - and Tit For Tat won again. 

	Tit For Tat never did the wrong thing first, always punished another program for doing the wrong thing, but always forgave the other program if it stopped doing the wrong thing. 

	That made an impression on me. That has influenced how I deal with other people.

	***

	**EDIT**: I just remembered! There's [an interactive game](https://ncase.me/trust/) based on this tournament.

		I seem to remember reading that a slightly modified Tit for Tat is now considered even better; and it's notable that it's *nicer*: "Tit for Tat with Forgiveness" which modifies Tit for Tat with an additional random chance (around 10% was a winner I think) to cooperate after the other agent defects.
		
		Eta: forgot that I meant to mention that it's main advantage is that it'll knock two tit-for-tat-ers (and some other "slow forgiveness" algorithms) out of a permanent defect for defect cycle.

			> I seem to remember reading that a slightly modified Tit for Tat is now considered even better;
			
			Yes. That was mentioned in the video I linked. 
			
			But the basic concepts still apply: be nice, retaliate if the other party does you wrong, and stop retaliating if the other party turns good again.

		What a strange coincidence. I literally came across this video 2 days ago and have been binging on game theory topics since then. Is this entire book good or just chapter 12?

		* 🟧 **[Algernon_Asimov](https://www.reddit.com/user/Algernon_Asimov)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-13 13:38:44)_

			The entire book is good, in my opinion. 
			
			It's an excellent examination of evolution and genetics. Firstly, it explains how individual genes (not whole organisms) are the unit being *selected* in "natural selection". Then, it explains how genes that act selfishly, in that they aim only to benefit themselves and the organism carrying them, can still incidentally end up helping other organisms around them, for their own selfish benefit. The "selfish gene" is what drives natural selection, and is what produces altruism and cooperation. 
			
			The book does talk a bit about game theory, but only secondarily: the primary topic is evolution and genetics. 
			
			So, if you're looking for books about game theory, this probably isn't "good" by your standards. It's a biology book, not a game theory book.

		I wish I had read this book before I took my evolution class in college. One of our lab classes was on cooperation and our lab grade for that day was based on the Prisoner’s dilemma. My lab group was paired with another lab group and they kept punishing us. We even tried to act in good faith, and we kept losing. The other lab groups in the class quickly learned that cooperation was best for everyone. We ended up finishing in last place, while the team that screwed us was second to last.

	An Immense World - its about how various animals perceive the world differently than humans because of their different sensory abilities and will change the way you think about nature. 

	Sapiens - It’s about how societies and civilizations function and how cultures form - all centered around the importance of shared myth making.  It will make you rethink everything you know about your civilization and your religion.  

	Killers of the Flower Moon - The book is way different from the movie as it  unravels like a mystery.  True story of the systematic murders of a group of wealthy native Americans. It will shock you over how dark and depraved humanity can be towards others. 

	Endurance - on a more positive note, Endurance is the incredible survival story of a doomed Antarctica expedition crew from 100 years ago, and will blow your mind over the amazing things that people are capable of overcoming.

	Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain.    

	If you are an introvert, read it. Actually did change my life as an introvert working at a very extraverted organization. Eased an ocean of anxiety and self-doubt. ✌🏼

	* 🟨 **[measureinlove](https://www.reddit.com/user/measureinlove)** ⬆️ 12 _(2024-04-13 12:50:54)_

		Yes, this was going to be my answer! At the time I read this, I was only a few years out of college and working for a very extroverted, micro-managing boss who I’m pretty sure didn’t like me simply because I was introverted. This book brought to the forefront for me what I think I had felt all along, but couldn’t quite crystallize in my mind: introversion is not a bad thing or a disorder or abnormal, and in fact gives us unique skills that the extroverts who run stuff just don’t have. 
		
		I’ve actually ended up mostly working in fields designed for extroverts (sales, event planning) and I find that my introvert qualities like introspection and desire to observe people have helped enormously. I once took a personality test when interviewing for a sales job and the hiring manager told me the results said I wouldn’t be a good salesperson, that I should be an accountant instead. She asked how I could account for that. I kinda shrugged and told her she had my sales numbers from my previous job on her resume and she could verify them with my previous job, but that just because my personality “didn’t fit” the stereotype of a salesperson didn’t mean I wouldn’t be successful. Thankfully she hired me and I was able to prove that I was right!

		For Undoctored though I found it was fairly obvious he was running the well dry on that topic. Decent but not as fly on the unusual wall as the first one and it's mini sequel.

But I also know I'm not going to experience that absolutely gut-wrenching afterword again since this was before that happened. Unbelievable book. Reading it for the second time ten years later is such a different experience now I'm an adult with responsibilities. 17 year old me loved this book for different reasons but I can't wait to get a whole different vibe from it. Amazing book.

	“Ultra Processed People” really helped me realize what the true cause of obesity in America is. We are good addicts. Anytime you bring up addiction, you have to bring up the option to abstain but you can’t abstain from Food. We are not addicted to all food. We are addicted specifically to Ultra Processed foods. Which are industrially produced food-like products that have not existed until just recently. You can abstain from most of it (it’s hard to do all) and lose weight without even trying to lose weight. It’s crazy. 

	Just anecdotal evidence so take it for what it is. I was on a plant based diet for a couple years and stayed at my cruising weight of 170lbs. I read this book and with a few lifestyle tweaking, I’m down to 148-150lbs.

		Came here to say this one, I read it recently and it was written in such a way that it makes me really think about food now pretty much every time I pick something up to eat - not in a way that I think is going to give me a complex or anything, but in a way that really makes me think about what exactly is in my food. Highly recommend for pretty much anyone who doesn’t eat exclusively home cooked meals honestly.

			Well I’m no teacher by any stretch of the imagination. I’m a coffee roaster by trade, my wife and I combined make a yearly $72,000 a year and just had a baby. We are very much working class. All I can do is tell you what worked for us. Maybe some of that might help someone. 
			
			We eat mostly plants, minimally processed. What that means is for proteins it’s usually beans, can beans (unsalted or low salt) like black beans, white beans, kidney beans, garbanzo beans (canned and dry) Tofu, and tempeh (for the love of god just boil it with salt, takes most of the bad taste off, pat dry then season/sear and you are golden) mung beans (blended with water as an egg replacement) list goes on.
			
			For carb/grains it’s usually brown rice, farro, pasta (semolina or whole wheat), corn tortillas ( made from scratch, unfortunately the ones in bags are ultra processed,I’m latino it’s a staple ) potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, turnips etc.
			
			Vegetables is all the rainbow basically except eggplant, I’m allergic. But namely, leafy greens: like bok choy and kale, collard greens, arugula, beet greens (basically all the above go-to move is pan fry with a couple tbs of olive oil, garlic, and ginger till they all wilt then finish with sesame oil and a touch of soy sauce.) then also Broccoli [of course] cauliflower, (air fry or steam in the microwave [ChefSteps has a good video on this]. Buy lots of fruit for snacks and to throw in a quick pb and fruit. Etc etc.
			
			Then for bread, I buy two loaves every other week and keep em sliced in my freezer. Keeps for up to a month if you don’t mind a bit of heating up in the air fryer or toaster in the morning. (I airfry at 325 for 4 minutes on the “reheat” settings)
			
			There is more to it but that’s the gist. I take every chance I can to cook make big batch of anything I cook to always have extra that I stuff away in the fridge with a masking tape label.

			I think it's more about awareness and reading food labels (for more than just fat and calorie content.)
			
			
			I actually think it's very attainable for the time-constrained (there are many processed options in my local organic aisle that are made with real ingredients) but I think would be much harder for money-constrained families. Ultraprocessed is usually cheap and the reverse is definitely true.
			
			
			For a good example that doesn't break the bank - Ragu's Simply line of pasta sauce doesn't have preservatives or added sugar. Minimizing ultraprocessing means looking for products like that.

		That sounds closely related to my pick: Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel by Jeane Kilbourne
		
		The close analysis of advertising copy was new to me at the time and I found it really fascinating. I then read Born to Buy: The Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture by Juliet Schor and found it similarly compelling and some other tangentially related books (Hungry City: How Food Shapes Our Lives by Carolyn Steel is an amazing work, you can just tell when the author has poured years and years of observation and documentation into the book) 
		
		Unfortunately I was in high school, lacking in guidance as to how to translate these ideas into my daily life and as a result, carried a deep anticonsumerist sentiment for a long time that made it difficult to advocate for myself and relate to my peers, on top of many other oddities.
		
		P.S. If I could go back and hand myself a different book at that critical moment in my life I would choose How To Live: or, A Life of Montaigne by Sarah Bakewell which I am currently halfway through.

* 🟩 **[coffeefueled-student](https://www.reddit.com/user/coffeefueled-student)** ⬆️ 42 _(2024-04-13 06:57:29)_

	The Anthropocene Reviewed by John Green is my favourite book right now and has been for a few years. It definitely shaped part of my outlook on life. It's so poignant despite being a nonfiction about ostensibly mundane things, I cried MANY times while reading it. It also reminded me that I absolutely *love* creative nonfiction, both writing and reading it. I will never cease to be impressed by the appreciation it gave me for life!

	Debt: the First 5000 Years by David Graeber also changed my outlook on life, but in regards to societal-level issues rather than personal life philosophy. It gave me a historical background on how we came to be where we are today with regard to our economic and political systems, which I think is incredibly valuable. Despite being about a lie told to uphold late-stage capitalism, it was surprisingly uplifting in the faith put in humans to do good, especially in discussions of how communities functioned before money. I'll warn that it's quite the commitment: 600+ pages of nonfiction isn't everyone's cup of tea!

	This Idea is Brilliant / This Idea Must Die, both Edge Question books edited by John Brockman, introduced me to lots of cool scientific ideas that had implications on the way I think and on my research interests as a science student. Although my degree is quite specific, I think it's important to be familiar with a wide range of scientific disciplines, at least at a surface level, in order to be able to think about your research from multiple perspectives. You never know when an idea from a seemingly unrelated topic will lead to a breakthrough in your field! Plus, despite studying microbiology, I'm also just interested in cosmology and theoretical physics, so it's fun to read that stuff even if it's not directly relevant. I can't remember which of these it was, but I do remember one of them having an essay in it that was remarkably misogynistic, especially considering the late 2010s release, but I guess that's the risk you take reading an edited anthology rather than a book by a single author.

			How Robert Moses, a respectable and unassuming bureaucrat of New York went from a seemingly earnest idealist and reformer to in many ways the most powerful political figure of the city by using (or misusing) unelected positions, favor trading, and steadily increasing his own field of influence.

	The Selfish Gene was referenced at least two times. I read this book. However it is made obsolete by a monster of intellectual work:

	The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002) is Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould's technical book on macroevolution and the historical development of evolutionary theory.[1] The book was twenty years in the making,[2] published just two months before Gould's death.[3] Aimed primarily at professionals,[4] the volume is divided into two parts. The first is a historical study of classical evolutionary thought, drawing extensively upon primary documents; the second is a constructive critique of the modern synthesis, and presents a case for an interpretation of biological evolution based largely on hierarchical selection, and the theory of punctuated equilibrium (developed by Niles Eldredge and Gould in 1972).[5]

	(Wikipedia article intro)

	This book is gigantic and brings some key concepts along with observations that are mind blowing. A must read.

		I'll add *Fellow Creatures: Our Obligations to the Other Animals* by Harvard philosophy professor Christine M. Korsgaard as a life changing book. 
		
		"We share the world with fellow creatures. That is to say, we share the world with other living beings who are, to varying degrees, sentient, intelligent, and self-aware. These other creatures find themselves, as we find ourselves, thrown into the world and faced with basic tasks of living: feeding themselves, raising children, and dealing with all the difficulties and dangers that arise from doing these things in a world where others, with competing interests, are trying to do them too. We eat these fellow creatures, raise them for that purpose in factory farms, force them to work for us and live with us, do experiments on them, make products out of them, decide where they may live and kill them when they interfere with our projects, and kill or injure or control them for various forms of entertainment and sport. These practices raise some obvious moral questions."
		
		It's a wonderful book, and part one especially is an accessible and wonderful insight into the thoughts of someone who deeply thought about the morally relevant differences between us and the other animals. Part two of the book is maybe too philosophical for some people, given that she delves into her Kantian case for animal ethics, but part three is more accessible again. I think the book is worth reading for part one alone, though.

			I don’t think I would get out of it as much had I gotten into it with high expectations, not wanting to imply that that’s your “fault”. I found that book when I was especially receptive to it - and had been for about 10-15 years - and I found a lot to admire about Frankl. Luckily, I am from Vienna as well, so I can visit various places, and the museum, whenever I feel like it. 
			
			Anyway, Frankl was a man I deeply admire, and has been of my two “guiding stars” (the other being Pratchett) for years now. Angry men, who still tried to see the best in people.

				I'm from Spain so I've had the chance to visit Anne Frank's house in the Netherlands and the Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin. Visiting these places in person really helps to picture what horrible things people like Frankl went through, imagining yourself in their place. (Some people in my family were also put in concentration camps, but that was for the Spanish Civil War, not WW2.) Even if I didn't get much practical use from Frankl's book, I have nothing but respect for him and what he went on to do after the war.

	Got a couple I haven't seen mentioned  -

	1. Silent Spring (Rachel Carson) - Probably one of the OG books about environmentalism. 

	2. Our bodies their Battlefield (Christina Lamb) - *TRIGGER WARNING* Though I won't mention in detail what wars do to women's bodies - it was horrifically enlightening how much of it actually goes on without anyone ever actually bringing it up. It's just profoundly sad and horrifying. It opened my eyes to things I didn't even know was happening - if anything probably made me more anti-war than I already was.

	The Birth of the Pill by Jonathan Eig provided scientific grounding for my belief that all women should have access to reliable contraception. In the years before the Pill, families struggled under crushing poverty from having to provide for 7+ children. Women pleaded with their doctors for help because continuous pregnancy was exhausting or even dangerous, and yet they didn't feel they could safely say no to their husbands' desires. This book reminded me to be grateful for the advantages I have today.

	* 🟨 **[FiveGoals](https://www.reddit.com/user/FiveGoals)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-04-13 22:29:15)_

		Pregnancy is still dangerous and exhausting - the death rate is still relatively high even in today’s day and age and it’s HARDLY talked about at all. If I threw out statistics here, it would be startling.
		
		But no one ever talks about this.

	No individual book has changed my life. It's the accumulation of all the books I've read that have changed me. That said, here are some recent good ones:

	- **Pegasus**, by Laurent Richard and Sandrine Rigaud. I read Snowden's biography last year, and Pegasus was the final nail in the coffin to step back a little from the internet. Changed my view of some countries.

	- **Growing up bin Laden**, kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Finished it very quickly. I think differently of Saudi Arabia now.

	- **Al Qaeda and What it Means to be Modern**, started out very interesting, a little weak towards the end, but still 5 stars. It's a little dated since it's from the early 2000s and politics change, but lots to think about.

	- **Factory Girls** by Leslie T. Chang, a look into the lives of factory workers in China, following the stories of two girls in particular. The author is a journalist and writes with a wonderful sense of humour, really brings Dongguan to life! Interesting to see this side of China. It think it's easy to get caught up in the bigger political picture when talking about China in the West, while forgetting or ignoring the everyday life that has shaped the country.

	- **China's Western Horizon**, interesting book on geopolitics, I especially liked the chapter on Kazakhstan.

	- **Fevers, Feuds, and Diamonds** by Paul Farmer: We all know Ebola, but we know little about everything else hidden behind the outbreaks. Apparently it's a mess of history, complicated wars, sociopolitical struggles, propaganda, and a bigger look at the state of healthcare in many developing countries. Absolutely required reading to understand developing countries, West Africa and the healthcare system as a whole.

	- **Factfulness** by Hans Rosling. It's a light book, easy to read, and I picked it up thinking it'd be a fluff read. But actually it was really helpful in changing the way I engaged with media, reframing some of my key mindsets and setting me on a path to learn more about the world.

	- **A Little Annihilation** by Anna Janko. Technically a sort of biography of the author's mother, but with philosophical and ethical ponderings mixed in, and the author's opinions on humanity. It's the first time I've found some of my beliefs reflected in somebody else and it was quite cathartic for me to read.
