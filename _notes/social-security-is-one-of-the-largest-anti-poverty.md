## Social Security is one of the largest anti-poverty plans in the nation. It’s shielded from just about every type of garnishment because it’s just that important—except student debt repayment plans. Before 2020 when payments were paused, thousands of Seniors had their Social Security checks garnished because they were unable to pay. Thankfully, a three year pause put that predatory government extraction to rest. But now that Biden has resumed payments, garnishment could resume in October of 2024 when the “on ramp” ends. This is why the Biden admin should have never turned payments back on. And this is why he should cancel all student debt.
