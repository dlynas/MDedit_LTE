	> Does this disprove the soul and substance dualism?

	No, at face it doesn't speak to this issue at all. The dualist never denied that there are interactions between the mind and body.

	> Are "We" really just a soulless meat brain and chemical reactions?

	Hardly anyone, including most materialists, think we are really just a soulless meat brain and chemical reactions. This is certainly not the implication of rejecting substance dualism.

					I'm not sure I feel particularly decisive about "picking a position" so to speak. Philosophy of mind, in the contemporary sense of an imagined field of inquiry which constitutes for itself the mind-body problem as a particular domain about which it can autonomously produce knowledge, strikes me as not usually operating in a particularly scientific manner. By 'scientific' I mean not the colloquial sense of what falls within the institutional divisions called scientific, and especially *natural* scientific, by the regulatory practices of our society. But rather the substantive sense of a field of inquiry organized systematically -- as to its premises, methods, norms, aims, etc. -- according to the conditions constituted by an object of study which itself is well-founded in the structures given as the basic facts of the human situation. There is instead, it seems to me, more often the undirected but sometimes creative grasping about, that hopes to chance on a fleeting grip of something in the surrounding darkness, that characterizes what we tend to think of -- usually imposing, what would probably be wrong to impose here, a temporal ordering -- the pre-scientific folk practices.
					
					I mean, I'm not often struck, in the work of this field, by the impression of a sensitivity to the question of how mind and body are disclosed within the field of human interests. The usual assumption seems to be that these things are categories always already ready to hand for the philosopher, who then needs exercise no particular curiosity about the possibility of this act before offering this or that reflection on them. Proceeding in such way, one often gets the impression that mind and body are, precisely, elements of the discourse of the ones calling themselves philosophers of mind, disclosed in the textual tradition constituted by the reports they share with one another, and need be -- should not be, even, for their purposes -- anything else.
					
					No doubt this pretense is not entirely false. The philosophers of mind, themselves also being human, cannot help but stumble now and then in their reflections on something that is at stake in the situation of human beings. But one might wish that such a connection be made not only on the basis that they are human beings, but even on the basis that they are philosophers. And there are sparks of relevance here and there. When Fodor questions how the theoretical claims of the different positive sciences relate to one another, or Midgley discusses how our different conceptions of the mind-body relation direct us toward similarly different practical projects in the conceptualization and subsequent pursuit of human health, we find philosophers reflecting on substantive matters. But such cases of substantiveness are hardly instances of the orienting point around which the field generally has been systematically organized.
					
					So that while we can learn much from the more creative of the theoretical graspings to be found in this literature, applaud those particular cases that struggle to evade its limitations, and engage with critical appraisal and interest the particular details of this or that study in their own context, in its systematic organization I'm not confident enough that the field is producing scientific knowledge to think that it's particularly sensible to regard the decisive choosing of one of its presented alternatives as a means of reliably articulating the truth.

						Do you know of any field in philosophy that, at least generally, proceeds in this way? 
						
						Everything I am familiar with seems to proceed closer to the phil of mind approach (eg metaethics) you described.

							No, I think any field of philosophy is susceptible to be treated in one or the other way. It's possible even that the inclination to think of philosophy as broken down into fields encourages a certain, fragmented way of treating philosophical work.

								Definitely! but I think I got confused by your use of "field of inquiry that..." I guess I am wondering what you have in mind as a comparison.

									Well, I am tempted to say: most philosophical work prior to the 1930s, or at least what we take to be such work after the sorting effects of historiography have had their way with it.
									
									Or, since then, I suppose, particularly, work in phenomenology and hermeneutic philosophy.

	Neurosurgery has been performed for [at least 8,000 years](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326281#:~:text=The%20oldest%20discovered%20skulls%20showing,begun%20in%20the%20Stone%20Age.); the folks who formulated substance dualism were well aware of the fact that damage to the brain can impact personality, coordination, and so on. This is not new information.

	News about the spinal implant may change how you personally feel about the brain, and that’s understandable, but philosophically this doesn’t present any information Descartes and his predecessors didn’t already have. If it obviates substance dualism now, it already did so then—and I don’t think it did.

	That’s not to say that I think traditional formulations of substance dualism are especially elegant, parsimonious, or necessarily accurate, but one thing they aren’t is obsolete. I think it’s possible and (in mind-body philosophy) common to overstate the novelty of the mind-body problem.

	I do want to highlight something you said:

	>	I am scared of only being a piece of meat inside of a skull.

	This sounds like a form of death anxiety to me, and I would encourage you to seek out therapy if this thought and those related to it become intrusive or disrupt your quality of life. As other commenters have pointed out, even reductive physicalists do not generally look at human consciousness in this way. This sounds to me like psychological distress.

		I used to be a Christian long ago but then I stopped believing in Christianity. I turned to substance dualism and my belief in God stayed but without any religion.
		
		I am not an atheist because I am scared of death. What if I am wrong and there is no heaven? This is why I like to believe that we do have souls and there is life after my death on earth. Without substance dualism, I would be worrying about the inevitable death of me and "myself" would be dead forever.

			You write:
			>	I am not an atheist because I am scared of death.
			
			Some folks may be critical of this, but I get it. And I admire your honesty.
			
			As someone who has gone through a very long existential journey, I have two pieces of advice. As they say in 12-step, take what you can use and leave the rest.
			
			The first is to own your agnosticism. Walk up to a mirror, look yourself in the eyes, and say “I’m agnostic” until it doesn’t feel strange. Because on a fundamental level, the idea of not identifying with an idea that you feel may be accurate, because you’re afraid of its implications, gives you a lot of vulnerability—more than I think you really have deep down, because people who are that vulnerable can’t be this honest. These are just words and I think there’s immense power in releasing yourself from the burden of knowing.
			
			The second is, with apologies to the existentialists, to treat death anxiety as the psychological symptom it is rather than as a philosophical problem to be resolved. The paradox of faith, or commitment to an ideology of any kind, is that being driven into it by untreated depression or anxiety can lead to a kind of white-knuckling dynamic where you become afraid of being confronted with your repressed death anxiety later on, which can make you close-minded and change resistant as you get older. This is where a lot of the bitterness and anti-intellectualism we see among fundamentalists comes from. There are many happy, well adjusted atheists who do not believe in an afterlife of any kind, and many intellectually honest religious people who are not driven by death anxiety. You have good options that the psychological symptom of death anxiety is hiding from you. So I would urge you to speak to a good therapist, with a grief background, about what you’re struggling with and how it is affecting your life.

			I appreciate your candidness in sharing your personal beliefs and your journey from Christianity to substance dualism. Your concern about death and the desire for an afterlife is not uncommon, and it's quite understandable why the concept of a soul and an existence beyond physical death can bring a sense of solace.
			However, your views prompt an interesting discussion about the nature of belief in God and the possible implications of such a belief devoid of the guiding frameworks often provided by religion.
			
			In many religious doctrines, belief in God goes beyond mere acknowledgment of a divine entity. It involves a rich, meaningful relationship often structured and guided by specific prescriptions. These prescriptions might involve rituals, moral codes, methods of prayer, or particular ways of understanding and interpreting divine will.
			When one moves away from these frameworks, as you did when departing from Christianity, it may inadvertently affect one's access to God. While it's possible to believe in God's existence without adhering to a specific religious doctrine, this belief may lack a certain depth or intimacy that can be critical in fully accessing the divine.
			Think of it in terms of a map and a destination. The destination, in this case, is God. A map, analogous to a religious framework, helps guide us to this destination. Without the map, we may know of the destination, we may believe in its existence, but finding our way to it may become a challenge.
			
			You mention that your belief in God persists despite not being attached to a specific religion. Without the map provided by religious prescriptions, the journey may not be as clear, and the potential to lose your way could be greater.

			You should check our _Staring at the Sun_ by Irvin Yalom. He engages (a bit superficially) with philosophy and tells lots of great stories.

	No, the case of the spinal implant does not disprove substance dualism. The brain implant does not measure thoughts. It measures electrical activity. The man had to learn how to direct his thoughts such that the correct electrical activity is produced. A substance dualist could say that the man's soul/mind/whatever causes the electrical activity.

	Nobody with any sense, dualist or not, denies that the mind can be interacted with physically, whether by drugs, anesthesia, or electricity.
