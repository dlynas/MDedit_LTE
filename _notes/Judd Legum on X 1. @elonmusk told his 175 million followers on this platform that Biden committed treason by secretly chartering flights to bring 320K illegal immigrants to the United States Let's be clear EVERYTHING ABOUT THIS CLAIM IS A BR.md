1.

told his 175 million followers on this platform that Biden committed "treason" by "secretly" chartering flights to bring 320K "illegal immigrants" to the United States Let's be clear: EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CLAIM IS A BRAZEN LIE Follow along for receipts 



2\. Musk is referring to a parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans. THIS IS NOT A SECRET! Biden announced it in a speech on 1/5/23. It was covered extensively in the media. It was promoted in press releases. It is featured now on the

8\. I will note that none of Musk's EMBARSSINGLY INACCURATE POSTS have a Community Note attached, despite reaching tens of millions of people. It shows what a joke the

Someone should download the CBP One app and make a step by step video of this insanity. That’s a lot of planes and a lot of airports. Amazing that they kept this secret for so long. x.com/Not\_the\_Bee/st…
