## The nestle baby formula scandal perfectly explains why capitalism is bad

> The tldr background
> 
> In the west during the baby boom nestle made a shit tone of money from formula. In the east formula is great but I requires a few things, clean water, clean bottles, money and the ability to read, and money. Furthermore very quickly without Brest feeding mothers stop producing Brest milk. Babies also have shit immune systems and bad digestion so hypothetically if the water or bottles weren't clean they would get sick, perhaps diorreagh and die and as the mother can't brest feed the child might die of malnutrition 
> 
> As the baby boom slowed down nestle started making less money so had to look abroad to Africa primarily. They posed as doctors to get mothers to take free formula samples, change the layouts of hospitals so they wouldn't be close to their babies. So after they got home they a lot of the time would find they couldn't afford formula. And in a lot of places they were doing this truly clean water was a luxury, water can be boiled however boiling that much water is hard over an open flame. Families had to spend massive chunks of their incomes on formula or ration contributing to malnutrition. Then there was the fact that often times the formula would be contaminated causing diorreagh.

> Nestle is responsible for, from numbers I've seen from 1976-2015 almost 11 million infant deaths. 
> 
> This came to a head with the USA getting them to self regulate and self enforce a set of rules and standards, like not targeting people without the means to do it safely.
> 
> This is still continuing in countries like Laos. 
> 
> No one went to prison, no one faced consequences. But they did make money

		Companies have been doing this shit for years and the United States government doesn’t care because it’s always profitable in the end. Here’s a link on how Coca Cola hired far right militias to kill trade unionists in Colombia.

		it's so hard. I just bought something last Sunday from what was once a "trusted" brand (you know, as far as brands go) and then found out they were actually purchased by Nestle years ago :|

		You have to start accepting the fact this is actually how the country works.  People don't fundamentally understand how evil capitalism is.

	Fun :) quote from former Nestle CEO Peter Brabeck-Letmathe :) - "Water is, of course, the most important raw material we have today in the world. It’s a question of whether we should privatize the normal water supply for the population. And there are two different opinions on the matter. **The one opinion, which I think is extreme, is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about declaring water a public right. That means that as a human being you should have a right to water. That’s an extreme solution.**"

	The free formula samples were timed to last exactly until the mothers would stop producing milk. The idea being that they’d be stuck buying it because they couldn’t start producing milk again unless they had another kid which would be impossible for at least nine months

	Both governments and corporations agree that lives of those outside the rich/developed world are worth less.  They treat the people of poorer countries similarly.  The usual excuse that they use is 'we followed local laws' or 'this is how their own governments and corporations treat them'.

	Of course in the case of Empire they also do shit involving military and economics to ensure those countries stay poor in the first place.
