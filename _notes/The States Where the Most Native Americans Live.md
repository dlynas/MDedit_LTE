The number of Americans who identify at least partially as American Indian or Alaska Native grew from 5.2 million in 2010 to 9.7 million in 2020 – an 85% increase, according to the most recent census.

The Census Bureau attributed the population’s growth in part to its own updates in procedure and survey questions. Because of these updates, it is unsure if the growth is a result of true population growth or if more people are identifying racially as Native American. The agency prioritized counting the American Indian and Alaska Native population in the 2020 census after [almost 5%](https://usafacts.org/articles/native-americans-and-us-census-how-count-has-changed/?utm_source=usnews&utm_medium=partnership&utm_campaign=fellowship&utm_content=link) of Native Americans living in reservations were undercounted in 2010.

American Indians and Alaska Natives made up 2.9% of the total American population in 2020, an increase from 1.6% in 2010. The country’s Native American population is honored every year on Native American Heritage Day, which is observed the Friday after Thanksgiving.

The Western part of the country is home to the highest concentration of Native Americans in the U.S., according to an analysis by [USAFacts](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-the-native-american-population-changed-since-the-last-census/?utm_source=usnews&utm_medium=partnership&utm_campaign=fellowship&utm_content=link).

Native Americans account for more than 10% of the population in [Alaska](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/alaska), [Oklahoma](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/oklahoma), [New Mexico](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-mexico) and [South Dakota](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/south-dakota). Alaska has the highest share of the American Indian and Alaska Native population at 22%, followed by Oklahoma with 16% and New Mexico with 12%.

Twenty states saw their Native American populations more than double since 2010, but Oklahoma saw the biggest growth, with a 30% increase since the last census.  

Census data shows that the Native American population is younger than the national average. The median age for anyone claiming at least partial Native American identity is 32.9, compared to 38.5 for the country at large. Additionally, 11% of Native Americans are 65 or older, compared to 17% of people in the greater population.

American Indians and Alaska Natives are also more likely to have served in the U.S. military than the overall population, with 7.5% of the population identifying as veterans, compared to 6.9% of the general population.

Additional data from the 2020 census is not yet available, but data from the 2019 American Community Survey contains more information about the Native American population. According to ACS, out of the 5.7 million people who identified as American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4 million also identified with at least one tribal grouping.

Nearly 1 in 6 Native Americans, or 1 million people, at least partially identified as Cherokee, making it the largest tribal identity. The second-largest group was the Navajo Nation, with over 418,000, followed by Choctaw, with 255,000.
