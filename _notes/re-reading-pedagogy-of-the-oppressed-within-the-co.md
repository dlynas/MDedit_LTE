## Re-reading Pedagogy of the Oppressed, within the context of the ongoing #genocide of #gaza has me reflecting a lot on resistance, the #psychology of the oppressor and of the oppressed, and the psychology of liberation.

One of the most important lessons from Freire is that the oppressed can never be ‚Äúviolent,‚Äù because they are not the initiators of violence. They respond to violence in pursuit of humanity, and this is an act of love.

We need to challenge how we think about and define violence if we want to achieve liberation for all.
