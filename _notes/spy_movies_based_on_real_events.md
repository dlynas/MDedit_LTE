## Spy movies based on real events

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/s6hult/spy_movies_based_on_real_events/](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/s6hult/spy_movies_based_on_real_events/)

> Ok, so I’ve been diving into the true story sept movie rabbit hole. I’ve noticed that there was a shit ton of evil stuff going on in the 60’s and 70’s with mossad and the cia. I’m looking for suggestions of movies/series based on true events. For example, the coldest game, the angel, the spy, Munich, bridge of lies, stuff like that. Preferably movies made in the 2000’s. HIT ME!!

	Some of the early Bond films were based on real events. Fleming served in Navy intelligence during World War 2 and worked with MI6 agents regularly, and he drew his inspirations from them. Apparently his Commanding Officer was the inspiration for M,

	On Amazon Prime UK - 'The Courier' (2021), indeed is a great movie. Cumberbatch in top form. A must-watch if you haven't seen it yet and like spy movies. Still, I found someintersting accuracy and continuity mistakes there. Surprising for such a good production.
