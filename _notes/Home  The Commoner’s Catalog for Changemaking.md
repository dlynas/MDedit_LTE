**The Commoner’s Catalog for Changemaking is born of a simple realization: _The world we have inherited is no longer working._**

**The good news is….Commoners are building a new world of possibilities right now, through land trusts and relocalized food, collaborative finance and artist collectives, gift economies and open-source everything: essential tools for the transitions ahead.**            _(Click on the cover below!)_
