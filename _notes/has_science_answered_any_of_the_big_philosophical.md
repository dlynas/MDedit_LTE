## Has science answered any of the big philosophical questions our ancestors posed millennia ago or are they all still unsolved?

> Perhaps (if so), this may mean that questions like “What is happiness?” and “Is the universe infinite?” are truly unanswerable

	Plenty of questions that used to be within the broader scope of what was called philosophy eventually "left" philosophy to become matters of science. Plato wrote about what "light" was and about the movement of the planets. Aristotle wrote about animals and the laws governing their reproduction and population growth. Now those are matters of physics, astronomy, biology, and I guess would be considered as solved in so far as there are broad scientific consensus on those areas.

		One cool example of this is Molyneux’s Problem (https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/molyneux-problem/) which was applied and tested in a real experiment. 
		
		(From the same link above): “Based on this study, it was concluded that the answer to Molyneux’s question is likely negative. Although after restoration of sight, the subjects could distinguish between objects visually as effectively as they would do by touch alone, they were unable to form the connection between object perceived using the two different senses. The results of the touch-to-vision tests were barely better than if the subjects had guessed. However, such cross-modal mappings developed rapidly, in the course of a few days (Held, et al., 2011).”

	Well regarding the two examples you gave, the first one can be seen as either a psychological question or a semantic one, and the second as a question for physicists. My point being that some questions fall out of philosophy and into other realms over time, and therefore not all philosophical questions of the past remain philosophical questions of today.

		Following on from my other comment about the extent of the universe - I was going to suggest that any modern philosophers of time would have to grapple with special and general relativity, and propose theories consistent with current best physics theories that suggest that there can be no such thing as a global "now".
		
		But [this review][rev] of Craig Bourne's *A Future for Presentism* (2006) suggests that he adopted the view of neo-Lorentzians, who hold that you *can* preserve the idea of a global "present" - which I think was an incredibly niche view in 2006, though I don't know enough physics to say whether it was clearly wrong. So perhaps philosophers feel less constrained than I thought.

			Questions about the purpose of things in biology have increasingly been assumed evolutionary biology

			Like Collin said, questions of purpose for example. Quine among others, like the logical positivists before him, brought about letting go of "why"-questions at large in (analytic) philosophy. Connected with this is the letting go of unobservables, so gods for example, and for naturalists specifically things that aren't if the physical realm (largely, some think, as even Quine did I feel somewhat contradictingly, that numbers exist in a real sense, and there are similar cases. But not many)

		As the [SEP entry](https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/cosmology/) on cosmology points out, there's no proof that the universe is infinite, and so I'd say the question is still reasonably open to (suitably informed) philosophical debate. Physicists *think* it probably is, and that the universe outside our observable "bubble" is uniform in all directions, but by definition we can't observe anything outside the observable universe and have no way of knowing.

	Physics has a current consensus, whilst admitting some complications, as to the fundamental matter of the universe. The *atoms* of the *atomists* have been replaced with waves or whatever (I'm not a physicist!).

	Certainly, physics is poised to answer questions about the size or infiniteness of the universe.

	And others have mentioned a bunch of biological stuff. Psychology has taken some, too. Plato's tripartite soul (really mind) has bee supplanted by a more complex (but surprisingly not too dissimilar) view of the human psyche.

	Of course, to provide any of these "answers", these various disciplines have to *assume* the answer to a number of contentious philosophical questions. In that sense, they haven't *answered* anything, but rather worked out ideologies that provide provisional explanations for folks who accept the starting assumptions. Basically, the same way religion provides answers.
