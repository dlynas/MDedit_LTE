## So to be clear about what this “ceasefire resolution” is:

- The Resistance would return all hostages, while no Palestinian hostages would be released
- Would allow Israel to invade Rafah
- Would force the UN to take the position that The Resistance used sexual violence (for which there is not a single scrap of evidence for because it literally didn’t happen)
- Would force the UN to completely take the position of all of Israel’s exact demands 
- Doesn’t even mention Palestinian statehood
- is not even an “immediate” ceasefire and
- Would only last for 6 weeks, only for the zionists to continue on with this currently genocide happening in lightning speed 

(Please add in the comments if we missed something)

But of course Russia & China are the evil ones for blocking this genocide resolution.

It is also important to note that multiple factions of The Resistance expressed gratitude towards Algeria, Russia & China for vetoing this fake ceasefire resolution carrying out the zionist demands.

So maybe listen to The Resistance instead of, you know, the western media channels controlled by The Empire that has been working overtime to manufacture your consent for this genocide since October 7th.

	"The ceasefire resolution that Russian-China just vetoed at the UN isn't actually a ceasefire.
	The resolution the US proposed says that there's an imperative for an immediate ceasefire,
	but it never actually calls on Israel to stop its massacre.
	The core for media is reporting that Russian-China have just vetoed a ceasefire, but don't
	actually tell you that Russian-China vetoed the resolution precisely because the ambiguous
	language would allow Israel to continue its massacre.
	And that's exactly what the US and Israel wanted.
	They proposed this resolution knowing it would be vetoed so every headline in all the
	major news networks would say Russian-China vetoed a ceasefire.
	This is part of a clear strategy emerging within the US ruling class to flip the narrative
	by making it look like the US wants a ceasefire and then it's the Palestinians who are blocking
	it.
	A few weeks ago, Kamal Harris came out and announced that she wanted to see a ceasefire
	in Gaza, which shocked everyone.
	The video circulated like wildfire and the corporate media was running headlines praising
	Kamal Harris saying Kamal Harris has proposed a ceasefire.
	But if you actually watched the"

	"full clip, Kamala Harris says immediately after that that she's calling for a six-week
	temporary ceasefire when it's already on the table.
	There must be an immediate ceasefire.
	More at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table.
	The ceasefire proposal she's referring to is the Israeli one, which would pause the
	fighting for six weeks during which Israel would get all of its prisoners back, and then
	the genocidal invasion of Rafa would continue.
	The ceasefire that Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Gavin Newsom, and all of these U.S. diplomats
	have come out in support of isn't actually a ceasefire that would end the war.
	It's literally Israel's exact negotiating position being repackaged as the ceasefire,
	one that would pause the fighting long enough so that Israel can get all of its people out,
	which would then allow Israel to decimate Rafa without having to worry about any domestic
	backlash.
	Israel has been clear from day one that their goal is to total takeover of Gaza and the
	destruction of the resistance."

	"We call for a ceasefire.
	We stress the importance of a ceasefire.
	Okay, but are you calling for a ceasefire?
	Well, uh, no.
	But we think it's a good idea?
	Just not right now.
	Well, then we reject your resolution.
	Wow, Russia and China bad.
	Wow, Russia and China don't want the ceasefire."

	"what the United States did in this resolution,
	not so cleverly because it was pretty obvious,
	was they didn't call for an immediate ceasefire.
	They called for an imperative to have an immediate ceasefire.
	In other words, it's not that they were saying
	there shouldn't be an immediate ceasefire,
	but they were not willing to call for one.
	They felt that there should be a call
	for an immediate ceasefire.
	That was the UN resolution
	that the United States put on the table.
	I want people to understand the difference.
	The Algerian resolution called for an immediate ceasefire.
	Now, order goes to the government of Israel
	in Tel Aviv, stop the firing now.
	The US resolution doesn't call for an order
	to go to Tel Aviv to stop the firing now.
	It's a statement that the word must agree
	that there should be an immediate ceasefire.
	In other words, it puts off a real resolution on a ceasefire."
