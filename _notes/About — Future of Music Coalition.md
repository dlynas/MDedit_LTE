### Our Mission

_Future of Music Coalition (FMC) is a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit organization supporting_ **_a musical ecosystem where artists flourish and are compensated fairly and transparently for their work._**

_FMC works with musicians, composers and industry stakeholders to_ **_identify solutions_** _to shared challenges. We promote strategies, policies, technologies and educational initiatives that_ **_always put artists first_** _while recognizing the role music fans play in shaping the future. FMC works to ensure that diversity, equality and creativity drives artist engagement with the global music community, and that these values are reflected in laws, licenses, and policies that govern any industry that uses music as raw material for its business._

### Our History

Founded in June 2000 by musicians, artist advocates, technologists and legal experts, Future of Music Coalition works to ensure that musicians have a voice in the issues that affect their livelihood. FMC’s activities are rooted in the real-world experiences and ambitions of working musicians, whose perspectives are often overlooked in policy debates. Over the years, FMC has provided an important forum for discussion about issues at the intersection of music, technology, policy and law. Guided by a firm conviction that public policy has real impact on the lives of both musicians and fans, FMC advocates for a balanced approach to music in the digital age — one that reflects the interests of all stakeholders, and not just the powerful few. By documenting historic and emerging trends in the music industry, FMChas become a trusted voice in the ongoing dialog about the challenges and opportunities facing today’s musicians. 

Founded in June 2000 by musicians, artist advocates, technologists and legal experts, Future of Music Coalition works to ensure that musicians have a voice in the debates that shape the industry, now and in the future. [](https://futureofmusic.org/article/article/future-music-manifesto)FMC’s 2000 manifesto framed the original intent of the organization around three core issues:

> _We build this organization as an attempt both to address pressing music-technology issues and to serve as a voice for musicians in Washington, DC, where critical decisions are being made regarding musicians’ intellectual property rights without a word from the artists themselves._
> 
>  _No longer will corporate media and big money be able to frame the discussion of music solely in terms of their industries, as we draw together the strongest voices in the technology and independent music communities to address questions of music in the marketplace with a clear-eyed focus on the interests of the artists.  
>   No longer will business interests or lobby groups for business interests drown out the voices of the musicians on whose art they have built an industry.  
>   No longer will idealistic techies and idealistic musicians find themselves locked into opposing sides of an issue that profoundly affects both of our communities._
