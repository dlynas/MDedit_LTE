if I told you that the New York Times hired a recently graduated college student with only a couple prior articles written on the subject of food and cooking to be their lead on the ground "reporter" on the "mass rape" hoax they fabricated, would you believe it? That's Adam Sella

here's a guy with a BA in literature and philosophy, focusing his entire work on food and cooking, and the New York Times suddenly after October 7 picks him to be their lead intrepid investigative on the ground "reporter" together with his relative Anat Schwartz. What the fuck

Adam Sella has zero reporting experience and expertise in general and specifically on the topic of sexual violence. Literally none. He just graduated from college. He writes about cooking. He's a wannabe Bourdain, and the NYT made him one of their lead "reporters" overnight. WTF

but it's much worse than that. And this is why the NYT desperately wants to scapegoat Anat Schwartz. She made public and explicit her and Adam Sella's intentions: They set out to fabricate atrocity propaganda "because it is important for Israel":

Replying to @TalulaSha

Ynet asks the photographer of "the woman in the black dress" how @nytimes reached her. She explains the rationale of the Israeli journalists Adam Sella & Anat Schwartz: "They called me again and again and explained how important it is to Israeli hasbara." ynet.co.il/laisha/article

this is like a bad comedy movie. Two totally unexperienced randos who no one has ever heard of, and who are related to one another, team up to travel around Israel to concoct the biggest hoax in the New York Times' history since Judith Miller. And it worked. They got published

and we know that at least one of them also served in Israeli military intelligence ([x.com/zei\_squirrel/s](https://x.com/zei_squirrel/status/1761740292015767736)). And then you get Jeffrey Gettleman, the Pulitzer-prize winner, to take the hoax fabricated by this absurd duo, writes it up, and says "I don't do evidence, I do stories."

BREAKING: Anat Schwartz, one of the principal authors of the NYT "mass rape" atrocity propaganda hoax, not only expressed support for genocidal mass murder of Palestinians right before they gave her that job, but also served in the Israeli military's intelligence service

this isn't just about Anat Schwartz. That's what the NYT desperately wants it to be about. Just focus on her social media etiquette, we'll maybe even cut her loose, but we'll keep the hoaxes Adam Sella, Jeffrey Gettleman and Anat Schwartz collaboratively fabricated in place

[

no, that's not how it works. You can't just hire a random fucking food writer straight out of college, who then does the core "reporting" with his relative, both with zero experience and explicitly admitting they set out to do propaganda, and keep it up

BREAKING: One of Israel's main media outlets Ynet has written about the New York Times' Anat Schwartz being exposed as a genocidal racist who said her fabrications were "important for Israeli hasbara \[propaganda\]." Ynet says Israeli sources are pressuring the NYT to cover for her
