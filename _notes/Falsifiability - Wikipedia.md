[![Pair of black swans swimming](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Black_Swans.jpg/290px-Black_Swans.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_Swans.jpg)

Here are two [black swans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan "Black swan"), but even with no black swans to possibly falsify it, "All swans are white" would still be shown falsifiable by "Here is a black swan"—a black swan would still be a state of affairs, only an imaginary one.<sup id="cite_ref-Popperonstateofaffairs_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-Popperonstateofaffairs-1">[A]</a></sup>

**Falsifiability** is a [deductive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive "Deductive") standard of evaluation of scientific theories and hypotheses, introduced by the [philosopher of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science") [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper "Karl Popper") in his book _[The Logic of Scientific Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Logic_of_Scientific_Discovery "The Logic of Scientific Discovery")_ (1934).<sup id="cite_ref-faithfultranslationofLoSD_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-faithfultranslationofLoSD-2">[B]</a></sup> A [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory "Scientific theory") or [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis") is **falsifiable** (or **refutable**) if it can be _logically_ contradicted by an [empirical test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_test "Empirical test").

Popper emphasized the asymmetry created by the relation of a universal law with basic observation statements<sup id="cite_ref-basicstatementsbreakthesymmetry_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-basicstatementsbreakthesymmetry-3">[C]</a></sup> and contrasted falsifiability to the intuitively similar concept of [verifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiability_(science) "Verifiability (science)") that was then current in [logical positivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism "Logical positivism"). He argued that the only way to verify a claim such as "All swans are white" would be if one could theoretically observe all swans,<sup id="cite_ref-blackswanimpossible_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-blackswanimpossible-4">[D]</a></sup> which is not possible. On the other hand, the falsifiability requirement for an anomalous instance, such as the observation of a single black swan, is theoretically reasonable and sufficient to logically falsify the claim.

Popper proposed falsifiability as the cornerstone solution to both the [problem of induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction "Problem of induction") and the [problem of demarcation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem "Demarcation problem"). He insisted that, as a logical criterion, his falsifiability is distinct from the related concept "capacity to be proven wrong" discussed in [Lakatos's falsificationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Falsificationism).<sup id="cite_ref-cleardistinctioncomplete_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-cleardistinctioncomplete-5">[E]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-twomeanings_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-twomeanings-6">[F]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-somecontradiction_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-somecontradiction-7">[G]</a></sup> Even being a logical criterion, its purpose is to make the theory [predictive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_power "Predictive power") and [testable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testability "Testability"), and thus useful in practice.

By contrast, the [Duhem–Quine thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis "Duhem–Quine thesis") says that definitive experimental falsifications are impossible<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMayo2018Sec._2.3_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMayo2018Sec._2.3-8">[1]</a></sup> and that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions, because an [empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_method "Empirical method") test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHarding1976X_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHarding1976X-9">[2]</a></sup>

Popper's response is that falsifiability does not have the Duhem problem<sup id="cite_ref-falsifiabilityasfalsificationproblems_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-falsifiabilityasfalsificationproblems-10">[H]</a></sup> because it is a logical criterion. Experimental research has the Duhem problem and other problems, such as the problem of induction,<sup id="cite_ref-inductionisalogicalfallacy_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-inductionisalogicalfallacy-11">[I]</a></sup> but, according to Popper, statistical tests, which are only possible when a theory is falsifiable, can still be useful within a [critical discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_rationalism "Critical rationalism").

As a key notion in the separation of science from [non-science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-science "Non-science") and [pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience "Pseudoscience"), falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.

## The problem of induction and demarcation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: The problem of induction and demarcation")\]

One of the questions in the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method "Scientific method") is: how does one move from [observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation "Observation") to [scientific laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law "Scientific law")? This is the problem of induction. Suppose we want to put the hypothesis that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot [validly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(logic) "Validity (logic)") argue (or _[induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning")_) from "here is a white swan" to "all swans are white"; doing so would require a [logical fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy "Logical fallacy") such as, for example, [affirming the consequent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent "Affirming the consequent").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGrayling2019397_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrayling2019397-12">[3]</a></sup>

Popper's idea to solve this problem is that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that _not_ every swan is white. Such falsification uses the valid inference _[modus tollens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens "Modus tollens")_: if from a law ![{\displaystyle L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8) we logically deduce ![{\displaystyle Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed), but what is observed is ![{\displaystyle \neg Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fad34798abb0bbbc063c906e459f103a09b1660e), we infer that the law ![{\displaystyle L}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8) is false. For example, given the statement ![{\displaystyle L=}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eb4cfedfc4601f344b83b634f7537f553acb735b) "all swans are white", we can deduce ![{\displaystyle Q=}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/092323466dd26223940abbcb3ffa05af4c093034) "the specific swan here is white", but if what is observed is ![{\displaystyle \neg Q=}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a630d343d4362750f509630953aff437ea57f2b) "the specific swan here is not white" (say black), then "all swans are white" is false. More accurately, the statement ![{\displaystyle Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed) that can be deduced is broken into an initial condition and a prediction as in ![{\displaystyle C\Rightarrow P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f9a7266ee149c5b5af8493d18f96d983f5e58f10) in which ![{\displaystyle C=}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e2ecca00636c431ce91819438ebccf105c88709e) "the thing here is a swan" and ![{\displaystyle P=}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a4db3adef01611d5cea6a0961ec02a8f1f867a15) "the thing here is a white swan". If what is observed is C being true while P is false (formally, ![{\displaystyle C\wedge \neg P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/53b090958281ecc0b61910fba9de545736b9f4da)), we can infer that the law is false.

For Popper, induction is actually never needed in science.<sup id="cite_ref-neveruseinduction_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-neveruseinduction-13">[J]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-inductionnotneeded_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-inductionnotneeded-14">[K]</a></sup> Instead, in Popper's view, laws are conjectured in a non-logical manner on the basis of expectations and predispositions.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1972_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1972-15">[4]</a></sup> This has led [David Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miller_(philosopher) "David Miller (philosopher)"), a student and collaborator of Popper, to write "the mission is to classify truths, not to certify them".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMiller19941_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller19941-16">[5]</a></sup> In contrast, the [logical empiricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_empiricism "Logical empiricism") movement, which included such philosophers as [Moritz Schlick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Schlick "Moritz Schlick"), [Rudolf Carnap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Carnap "Rudolf Carnap"), [Otto Neurath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Neurath "Otto Neurath"), and [A.J. Ayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.J._Ayer "A.J. Ayer") wanted to formalize the idea that, for a law to be scientific, it must be possible to argue on the basis of observations either in favor of its truth or its falsity. There was no consensus among these philosophers about how to achieve that, but the thought expressed by Mach's dictum that "where neither confirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not concerned" was accepted as a basic precept of critical reflection about science.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEUebel2019_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEUebel2019-17">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECreath2017_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTECreath2017-18">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMacLennan2021Chap._8.1_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMacLennan2021Chap._8.1-19">[8]</a></sup>

Popper said that a demarcation criterion was possible, but we have to use the _logical possibility_ of falsifications, which is falsifiability. He cited his encounter with [psychoanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis "Psychoanalysis") in the 1910s. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also.<sup id="cite_ref-OneThousandFoldAdler_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-OneThousandFoldAdler-20">[L]</a></sup> For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if one finds an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true. A verification has no value in itself. But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, there is a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.<sup id="cite_ref-thorntonbetterifcorroborated_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-thorntonbetterifcorroborated-21">[M]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-popperbetterifcorroborated_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-popperbetterifcorroborated-22">[N]</a></sup> In the [definition of falsifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Basic_statements_and_the_definition_of_falsifiability), contradictions with observations are not used to support eventual falsifications, but for _logical_ "falsifications" that show that the law makes risky predictions, which is completely different.

On the basic philosophical side of this issue, Popper said that some philosophers of the [Vienna Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Circle "Vienna Circle") had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in [verificationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verificationism "Verificationism") a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless. In opposition to this view, Popper said that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [criterion of demarcation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem "Demarcation problem").<sup id="cite_ref-britannicameaningvstestability_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-britannicameaningvstestability-23">[O]</a></sup>

### From Hume's problem to non problematic induction\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: From Hume's problem to non problematic induction")\]

The problem of induction is often called Hume's problem. [David Hume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume "David Hume") studied how human beings obtain new knowledge that goes beyond known laws and observations, including how we can discover new laws. He understood that deductive logic could not explain this learning process and argued in favour of a mental or psychological process of learning that would not require deductive logic. He even argued that this learning process cannot be justified by any general rules, deductive or not.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEThornton2007_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThornton2007-24">[9]</a></sup> Popper accepted Hume's argument and therefore viewed progress in science as the result of quasi-induction, which does the same as induction, but has no inference rules to justify it.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1959Sec._85_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1959Sec._85-25">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWatkins1984Sec._7.2_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWatkins1984Sec._7.2-26">[11]</a></sup> [Philip N. Johnson-Laird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Johnson-Laird "Philip Johnson-Laird"), professor of psychology, also accepted Hume's conclusion that induction has no justification. For him induction does not require justification and therefore can exist in the same manner as Popper's quasi-induction does.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJohnson-Laird2006Chap._13_27-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJohnson-Laird2006Chap._13-27">[12]</a></sup>

When Johnson-Laird says that no justification is needed, he does not refer to a general inductive method of justification that, to avoid a circular reasoning, would not itself require any justification. On the contrary, in agreement with Hume, he means that there is no general method of justification for induction and that's ok, because the induction steps do not require justification.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJohnson-Laird2006Chap._13_27-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJohnson-Laird2006Chap._13-27">[12]</a></sup> Instead, these steps use [patterns of induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning"), which are not expected to have a general justification: they may or may not be applicable depending on the background knowledge. Johnson-Laird wrote: "\[P\]hilosophers have worried about which properties of objects warrant inductive inferences. The answer rests on knowledge: we don't infer that all the passengers on a plane are male because the first ten off the plane are men. We know that this observation doesn't rule out the possibility of a woman passenger."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJohnson-Laird2006Chap._13_27-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJohnson-Laird2006Chap._13-27">[12]</a></sup> The reasoning pattern that was not applied here is [enumerative induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning#Enumerative_induction "Inductive reasoning").

Popper was interested in the overall learning process in science, to quasi-induction, which he also called the "path of science".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1959Sec._85_25-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1959Sec._85-25">[10]</a></sup> However, Popper did not show much interest in these reasoning patterns, which he globally referred to as psychologism.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1959Sec_2_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1959Sec_2-28">[13]</a></sup> He did not deny the possibility of some kind of psychological explanation for the learning process, especially when psychology is seen as an extension of biology, but he felt that these biological explanations were not within the scope of epistemology.<sup id="cite_ref-Popperpsychologyshouldbebiology_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-Popperpsychologyshouldbebiology-29">[P]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Popperepistemologywithoutbiology_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-Popperepistemologywithoutbiology-30">[Q]</a></sup> Popper proposed an evolutionary mechanism to explain the success of science,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1972App._1.III_31-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1972App._1.III-31">[14]</a></sup> which is much in line with Johnson-Laird's view that "induction is just something that animals, including human beings, do to make life possible",<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEJohnson-Laird2006Chap._13_27-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJohnson-Laird2006Chap._13-27">[12]</a></sup> but Popper did not consider it a part of his epistemology.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1972App._1.II_32-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1972App._1.II-32">[15]</a></sup> He wrote that his interest was mainly in the _logic_ of science and that epistemology should be concerned with logical aspects only.<sup id="cite_ref-Popperagainstpsichologism_33-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-Popperagainstpsichologism-33">[R]</a></sup> Instead of asking why science succeeds he considered the pragmatic problem of induction.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1972Sec._1.9_34-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1972Sec._1.9-34">[16]</a></sup> This problem is not how to justify a theory or what is the global mechanism for the success of science but only what methodology do we use to pick one theory among theories that are already conjectured. His methodological answer to the latter question is that we pick the theory that is the most tested with the available technology: "the one, which in the light of our _critical discussion_, appears to be the best so far".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1972Sec._1.9_34-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1972Sec._1.9-34">[16]</a></sup> By his own account, because only a negative approach was supported by logic, Popper adopted a negative methodology.<sup id="cite_ref-Popperabouthisnegativemethodology_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-Popperabouthisnegativemethodology-35">[S]</a></sup> The purpose of his methodology is to prevent "the policy of immunizing our theories against refutation". It also supports some "dogmatic attitude" in defending theories against criticism, because this allows the process to be more complete.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper197230_36-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper197230-36">[17]</a></sup> This negative view of science was much criticized and not only by Johnson-Laird.

In practice, some steps based on observations can be justified under assumptions, which can be very natural. For example, Bayesian inductive logic<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGelmanShalizi2013_37-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGelmanShalizi2013-37">[18]</a></sup> is justified by theorems that make explicit assumptions. These theorems are obtained with deductive logic, not inductive logic. They are sometimes presented as steps of induction, because they refer to laws of probability, even though they do not go beyond deductive logic. This is yet a third notion of induction, which overlaps with deductive logic in the following sense that it is supported by it. These deductive steps are not really inductive, but the overall process that includes the creation of assumptions is inductive in the usual sense. In a [fallibilist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallibilist "Fallibilist") perspective, a perspective that is widely accepted by philosophers, including Popper,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1983xxxv_38-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1983xxxv-38">[19]</a></sup> every logical step of learning only creates an assumption or reinstates one that was doubted—that is all that science logically does.

## The elusive distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: The elusive distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology")\]

Popper distinguished between the logic of science and its applied _methodology_.<sup id="cite_ref-cleardistinctioncomplete_5-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-cleardistinctioncomplete-5">[E]</a></sup> For example, the falsifiability of Newton's law of gravitation, as defined by Popper, depends purely on the logical relation it has with a statement such as "The brick fell upwards when released".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChalmers201362_39-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChalmers201362-39">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-appledancingexample_40-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-appledancingexample-40">[T]</a></sup> A brick that falls upwards would not alone falsify Newton's law of gravitation. The capacity to verify the absence of conditions such as a hidden string<sup id="cite_ref-invisiblestrings_41-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-invisiblestrings-41">[U]</a></sup> attached to the brick is also needed for this state of affairs<sup id="cite_ref-Popperonstateofaffairs_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-Popperonstateofaffairs-1">[A]</a></sup> to eventually falsify Newton's law of gravitation. However, these applied methodological considerations are irrelevant in falsifiability, because it is a logical criterion. The empirical requirement on the potential falsifier, also called the _material requirement_,<sup id="cite_ref-thematerialrequirement_42-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-thematerialrequirement-42">[V]</a></sup> is only that it is observable [inter-subjectively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjective_verifiability "Intersubjective verifiability") with existing technologies. There is no requirement that the potential falsifier can actually show the law to be false. The purely logical contradiction, together with the material requirement, are sufficient. The logical part consists of theories, statements, and their purely logical relationship together with this material requirement, which is needed for a connection with the methodological part.

The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which are used to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc. These include statistical tests: Popper is aware that observation statements are accepted with the help of statistical methods and that these involve methodological decisions.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1959Sec._68_43-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1959Sec._68-43">[21]</a></sup> When this distinction is applied to the term "falsifiability", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term "falsifiable". Popper said that he only uses "falsifiability" or "falsifiable" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks instead of "falsification" and its problems.<sup id="cite_ref-twomeanings_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-twomeanings-6">[F]</a></sup>

Popper said that methodological problems require proposing methodological rules. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then one has retired oneself from the game of science.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1959[httpsbooksgooglecombooksid0a5bLBbe_dMCpgPA32_32]_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1959[httpsbooksgooglecombooksid0a5bLBbe_dMCpgPA32_32]-44">[22]</a></sup> The logical side does not have such methodological problems, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because basic statements are not required to be possible. Methodological rules are only needed in the context of actual falsifications.

So observations have two purposes in Popper's view. On the methodological side, observations can be used to show that a law is false, which Popper calls falsification. On the logical side, observations, which are purely logical constructions, do not show a law to be false, but contradict a law to show its falsifiability. Unlike falsifications and _free from the problems of falsification_, these contradictions establish the value of the law, which may eventually be corroborated.

## Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability")\]

### Basic statements\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Basic statements")\]

In Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be analyzed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<sup id="cite_ref-fourlinesoftesting_47-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-fourlinesoftesting-47">[W]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-poppernoapriori_48-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-poppernoapriori-48">[X]</a></sup> The set of all purely logical observations that are considered constitutes the empirical basis. Popper calls them the _basic statements_ or _test statements_. They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper says that basic statements do not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that they are accepted by convention as belonging to the empirical language, a language that allows [intersubjective verifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjective_verifiability "Intersubjective verifiability"): "they must be testable by intersubjective observation (the material requirement)".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEShea2020[httpsieputmedupop-sciSH2c_Sec._2.c]_49-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShea2020[httpsieputmedupop-sciSH2c_Sec._2.c]-49">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-keuthbasicstatementsdependontechnology_50-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-keuthbasicstatementsdependontechnology-50">[Y]</a></sup> See the examples in section [§ Examples of demarcation and applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Examples_of_demarcation_and_applications).

In more than twelve pages of _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1959sec._13–15,_28_51-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1959sec._13%E2%80%9315,_28-51">[26]</a></sup> Popper discusses informally which statements among those that are considered in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law "all swans are white" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as "there exists a black swan" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, "this swan here is black" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.

### The definition of falsifiability\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: The definition of falsifiability")\]

Thornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular "observation-reports". He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:

> "A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits—this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out)."
> 
> — Thornton, Stephen, [Thornton 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFThornton2016), at the end of section 3

As in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<sup id="cite_ref-nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements_52-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements-52">[Z]</a></sup> The first decision described by Lakatos<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELakatos197822_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTELakatos197822-53">[27]</a></sup> is implicit in this agreement, but the other decisions are not needed. This agreement, if one can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in detail and, as described in section [§ Dogmatic falsificationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Dogmatic_falsificationism), an actual agreement is needed. This may require using a deeper empirical basis,<sup id="cite_ref-nosolidgrown_54-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-nosolidgrown-54">[AA]</a></sup> hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ([Andersson 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFAndersson2016) gives some examples).

Popper says that despite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to solid ground,<sup id="cite_ref-nosolidgrown_54-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-nosolidgrown-54">[AA]</a></sup> the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which the whole logical process of science<sup id="cite_ref-fourlinesoftesting_47-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-fourlinesoftesting-47">[W]</a></sup> would not be possible.

### Initial condition and prediction in falsifiers of laws\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Initial condition and prediction in falsifiers of laws")\]

In his analysis of the scientific nature of universal laws, Popper arrived at the conclusion that laws must "allow us to deduce, roughly speaking, more _empirical_ singular statements than we can deduce from the initial conditions alone."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1959[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidLWSBAgAAQBAJpgPA64_64–65]_55-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1959[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidLWSBAgAAQBAJpgPA64_64%E2%80%9365]-55">[28]</a></sup> A singular statement that has one part only cannot contradict a universal law. A falsifier of a law has always two parts: the initial condition and the singular statement that contradicts the prediction.

However, there is no need to require that falsifiers have two parts in the definition itself. This removes the requirement that a falsifiable statement must make prediction. In this way, the definition is more general and allows the basic statements themselves to be falsifiable.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1959[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidLWSBAgAAQBAJpgPA64_64–65]_55-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1959[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidLWSBAgAAQBAJpgPA64_64%E2%80%9365]-55">[28]</a></sup> Criteria that require that _a law_ must be predictive, just as is required by falsifiability (when applied to laws), Popper wrote, "have been put forward as criteria of the meaningfulness of sentences (rather than as criteria of demarcation applicable to theoretical systems) again and again after the publication of my book, even by critics who pooh-poohed my criterion of falsifiability."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1959[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidLWSBAgAAQBAJpgPA65_p._65_Footnote_*1]_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1959[httpsbooksgooglecombooksidLWSBAgAAQBAJpgPA65_p._65_Footnote_*1]-56">[29]</a></sup>

### Falsifiability in model theory\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Falsifiability in model theory")\]

Scientists such as the [Nobel laureate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates "List of Nobel laureates") [Herbert A. Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon "Herbert A. Simon") have studied the semantic aspects of the logical side of falsifiability.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESimonGroen1973_57-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTESimonGroen1973-57">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESimon1985_58-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTESimon1985-58">[31]</a></sup> These studies were done in the perspective that a logic is a relation between formal sentences in languages and a collection of mathematical structures. The relation, usually denoted ![{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}\models \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8a7ab842d8d2ad241982e7141da0ac254fbbbab7), says the formal sentence ![{\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) is true when interpreted in the structure ![{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {A}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/34aa92fbdb716183c034a2cfc30dafbaa51cfcd6)—it provides the semantic of the languages.<sup id="cite_ref-modeltheoryperspective_59-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-modeltheoryperspective-59">[AB]</a></sup> According to [Rynasiewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rynasiewicz "Robert Rynasiewicz"), in this semantic perspective, falsifiability as defined by Popper means that in some observation structure (in the collection) there exists a set of observations which refutes the theory.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERynasiewicz1983Sec._2_60-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTERynasiewicz1983Sec._2-60">[32]</a></sup> An even stronger notion of falsifiability was considered, which requires, not only that there exists one structure with a contradicting set of observations, but also that all structures in the collection that cannot be expanded to a structure that satisfies ![{\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) contain such a contradicting set of observations.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERynasiewicz1983Sec._2_60-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTERynasiewicz1983Sec._2-60">[32]</a></sup>

## Examples of demarcation and applications\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Examples of demarcation and applications")\]

### Newton's theory\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Newton's theory")\]

In response to Lakatos who suggested that Newton's theory was as hard to show falsifiable as Freud's psychoanalytic theory, Popper gave the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<sup id="cite_ref-appledancingexample_40-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-appledancingexample-40">[T]</a></sup> Popper thought that it was a basic statement that was a potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because the position of the apple at different times can be measured. Popper's claims on this point are [controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Ahistorical_versus_historiographical), since Newtonian physics does not deny that there could be forces acting on the apple that are stronger than Earth's gravity.

### Einstein's equivalence principle\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Einstein's equivalence principle")\]

Another example of a basic statement is "The inert mass of this object is ten times larger than its gravitational mass." This is a basic statement because the inert mass and the gravitational mass can both be measured separately, even though it never happens that they are different. It is, as described by Popper, a valid falsifier for Einstein's equivalence principle.<sup id="cite_ref-einsteinquivalenceprincipleisfalsifiable_61-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-einsteinquivalenceprincipleisfalsifiable-61">[AC]</a></sup>

A black-bodied and white-bodied peppered moth

In a discussion of the theory of evolution, Popper mentioned industrial melanism<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERudge2005_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTERudge2005-62">[33]</a></sup> as an example of a falsifiable law. A corresponding basic statement that acts as a potential falsifier is "In this industrial area, the relative fitness of the white-bodied [peppered moth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppered_moth_evolution "Peppered moth evolution") is high." Here "fitness" means "reproductive success over the next generation".<sup id="cite_ref-Fisherdefoffitness_63-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-Fisherdefoffitness-63">[AD]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-64">[AE]</a></sup> It is a basic statement, because it is possible to separately determine the kind of environment, industrial vs natural, and the relative fitness of the white-bodied form (relative to the black-bodied form) in an area, even though it never happens that the white-bodied form has a high relative fitness in an industrial area.

#### Precambrian rabbit\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Precambrian rabbit")\]

A famous example of a basic statement from [J. B. S. Haldane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane "J. B. S. Haldane") is "\[These are\] fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era." This is a basic statement because it is possible to find a fossil rabbit and to determine that the date of a fossil is in the Precambrian era, even though it never happens that the date of a rabbit fossil is in the Precambrian era. Despite [opinions to the contrary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objections_to_evolution#Unfalsifiability "Objections to evolution"),<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETheobald2006_65-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTETheobald2006-65">[34]</a></sup> sometimes wrongly attributed to Popper,<sup id="cite_ref-evolutionhypothesescanoftenbetested_66-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-evolutionhypothesescanoftenbetested-66">[AF]</a></sup> this shows the scientific character of paleontology or the history of the evolution of life on Earth, because it contradicts the hypothesis in paleontology that all mammals existed in a much more recent era. [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins "Richard Dawkins") adds that any other modern animal, such as a hippo, would suffice.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWallis2005_67-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWallis2005-67">[35]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDawkins1995_68-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDawkins1995-68">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDawkins1986_69-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDawkins1986-69">[37]</a></sup>

### Simple examples of unfalsifiable statements\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Simple examples of unfalsifiable statements")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/GuidoReni_MichaelDefeatsSatan.jpg/290px-GuidoReni_MichaelDefeatsSatan.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GuidoReni_MichaelDefeatsSatan.jpg "Even if it is accepted that angels exist, "All angels have large wings" is not falsifiable, because no technology exists to identify and observe angels.")

Even if it is accepted that angels exist, "All angels have large wings" is not falsifiable, because no technology exists to identify and observe angels.

A simple example of a non-basic statement is "This angel does not have large wings." It is not a basic statement, because though the absence of large wings can be observed, no technology (independent of the presence of wings<sup id="cite_ref-iftechnologyiswingsthentautology_70-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-iftechnologyiswingsthentautology-70">[AG]</a></sup>) exists to identify angels. Even if it is accepted that angels exist, the sentence "All angels have large wings" is not falsifiable.

Another example from Popper of a non-basic statement is "This human action is altruistic." It is not a basic statement, because no accepted technology allows us to determine whether or not an action is motivated by self-interest. Because no basic statement falsifies it, the statement that "All human actions are egotistic, motivated by self-interest" is thus not falsifiable.<sup id="cite_ref-allactionsareegotisticnotfalsifiable_71-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-allactionsareegotisticnotfalsifiable-71">[AH]</a></sup>

### Omphalos hypothesis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Omphalos hypothesis")\]

Some adherents of [young-Earth creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young-Earth_creationism "Young-Earth creationism") make an argument (called the Omphalos hypothesis after the Greek word for navel) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs. This ad hoc hypothesis introduced into young-Earth creationism is unfalsifiable because it says that the time of creation (of a species) measured by the accepted technology is illusory and no accepted technology is proposed to measure the claimed "actual" time of creation. Moreover, if the ad hoc hypothesis says that the world was created as we observe it today without stating further laws, by definition it cannot be contradicted by observations and thus is not falsifiable. This is discussed by Dienes in the case of a variation on the Omphalos hypothesis, which, in addition, specifies that God made the creation in this way to test our faith.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDienes200818–19_72-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDienes200818%E2%80%9319-72">[38]</a></sup>

### Useful metaphysical statements\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Useful metaphysical statements")\]

[Grover Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grover_Maxwell&action=edit&redlink=1 "Grover Maxwell (page does not exist)") <sup>&nbsp;[<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Maxwell" title="es:Grover Maxwell">es</a>]</sup> discussed statements such as "All men are mortal."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974294–295_73-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974294%E2%80%93295-73">[39]</a></sup> This is not falsifiable, because it does not matter how old a man is, maybe he will die next year.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKeuth200544–45_74-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeuth200544%E2%80%9345-74">[40]</a></sup> Maxwell said that this statement is nevertheless useful, because it is often corroborated. He coined the term "corroboration without demarcation". Popper's view is that it is indeed useful, because Popper considers that metaphysical statements can be useful, but also because it is indirectly corroborated by the corroboration of the falsifiable law "All men die before the age of 150." For Popper, if no such falsifiable law exists, then the metaphysical law is less useful, because it is not indirectly corroborated.<sup id="cite_ref-popperexistentialstatementsverifiedbystronger_75-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-popperexistentialstatementsverifiedbystronger-75">[AI]</a></sup> This kind of non-falsifiable statements in science was noticed by Carnap as early as 1937.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELeitgebCarus2021Sec._8.1_76-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTELeitgebCarus2021Sec._8.1-76">[41]</a></sup>

[Clyde Cowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Cowan "Clyde Cowan") conducting the [neutrino experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowan%E2%80%93Reines_neutrino_experiment "Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment") (c. 1956)

Maxwell also used the example "All solids have a melting point." This is not falsifiable, because maybe the melting point will be reached at a higher temperature.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974294–295_73-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974294%E2%80%93295-73">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKeuth200544–45_74-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeuth200544%E2%80%9345-74">[40]</a></sup> The law is falsifiable and more useful if we specify an upper bound on melting points or a way to calculate this upper bound.<sup id="cite_ref-keuthfinitemeltingpoint_77-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-keuthfinitemeltingpoint-77">[AJ]</a></sup>

Another example from Maxwell is "All [beta decays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay "Beta decay") are accompanied with a neutrino emission from the same nucleus."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974299_78-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974299-78">[42]</a></sup> This is also not falsifiable, because maybe the neutrino can be detected in a different manner. The law is falsifiable and much more useful from a scientific point of view, if the [method to detect the neutrino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowan%E2%80%93Reines_neutrino_experiment "Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment") is specified.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper19741038_79-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper19741038-79">[43]</a></sup> Maxwell said that most scientific laws are metaphysical statements of this kind,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974295_80-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974295-80">[44]</a></sup> which, Popper said, need to be made more precise before they can be indirectly corroborated.<sup id="cite_ref-popperexistentialstatementsverifiedbystronger_75-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-popperexistentialstatementsverifiedbystronger-75">[AI]</a></sup> In other words, specific technologies must be provided to make the statements inter-subjectively-verifiable, i.e., so that scientists know what the falsification or its failure actually means.

In his critique of the falsifiability criterion, Maxwell considered the requirement for decisions in the falsification of, both, the emission of neutrinos (see [§ Dogmatic falsificationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Dogmatic_falsificationism)) and the existence of the melting point.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974299_78-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974299-78">[42]</a></sup> For example, he pointed out that had no neutrino been detected, it could have been because some conservation law is false. Popper did not argue against the problems of falsification per se. He always acknowledged these problems. Popper's response was at the logical level. For example, he pointed out that, if a specific way is given to trap the neutrino, then, at the level of the language, the statement is falsifiable, because "no neutrino was detected after using this specific way" formally contradicts it (and it is inter-subjectively-verifiable—people can repeat the experiment).

### Natural selection\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Natural selection")\]

In the 5th and 6th editions of _[On the Origin of Species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species "On the Origin of Species")_, following a suggestion of [Alfred Russel Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace "Alfred Russel Wallace"), Darwin used "Survival of the fittest", an expression first coined by [Herbert Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer "Herbert Spencer"), as a synonym for "Natural Selection".<sup id="cite_ref-naturalselectionassurvivalofthefittest_81-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-naturalselectionassurvivalofthefittest-81">[AK]</a></sup> Popper and others said that, if one uses the most widely accepted definition of "fitness" in modern biology (see subsection [§ Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Evolution)), namely reproductive success itself, the expression "survival of the fittest" is a tautology.<sup id="cite_ref-thompsonnaturalselectionastautology_82-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-thompsonnaturalselectionastautology-82">[AL]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-naturalselectionasatautology_83-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-naturalselectionasatautology-83">[AM]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-poppernaturalselectiontautological_84-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-poppernaturalselectiontautological-84">[AN]</a></sup>

Darwinist [Ronald Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher "Ronald Fisher") worked out mathematical theorems to help answer questions regarding natural selection. But, for Popper and others, there is no (falsifiable) law of Natural Selection in this, because these tools only apply to some rare traits.<sup id="cite_ref-thompsonnotalltraitsaffectfitness_85-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-thompsonnotalltraitsaffectfitness-85">[AO]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-poppernotalltraitsaffectfitness_86-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-poppernotalltraitsaffectfitness-86">[AP]</a></sup> Instead, for Popper, the work of Fisher and others on Natural Selection is part of an important and successful metaphysical research program.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEElginSober2017_87-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEElginSober2017-87">[45]</a></sup>

### Mathematics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Mathematics")\]

Popper said that not all unfalsifiable statements are useless in science. Mathematical statements are good examples. Like all [formal sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_science "Formal science"), mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism") world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity "Quantity"), [structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure "Structure"), [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") and [change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus "Calculus"). Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality "Reality"). [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") wrote, "One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEEinstein2010_88-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEinstein2010-88">[46]</a></sup>

### Historicism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Historicism")\]

Popper made a clear distinction between the original theory of Marx and what came to be known as Marxism later on.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1995[httpsarchiveorgdetailsinernetdli201577661pagen101mode1up_Chap._15]_89-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1995[httpsarchiveorgdetailsinernetdli201577661pagen101mode1up_Chap._15]-89">[47]</a></sup> For Popper, the original theory of Marx contained genuine scientific laws. Though they could not make preordained predictions, these laws constrained how changes can occur in society. One of them was that changes in society cannot "be achieved by the use of legal or political means".<sup id="cite_ref-marxismoriginallaw_90-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-marxismoriginallaw-90">[AQ]</a></sup> In Popper's view, this was both testable and subsequently falsified. "Yet instead of accepting the refutations", Popper wrote, "the followers of Marx re-interpreted both the theory and the evidence in order to make them agree. ... They thus gave a 'conventionalist twist' to the theory; and by this stratagem they destroyed its much advertised claim to scientific status."<sup id="cite_ref-marxismearlierversionswerefalsifiable_91-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-marxismearlierversionswerefalsifiable-91">[AR]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-thorntonmarxismchangeofstatus_92-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-thorntonmarxismchangeofstatus-92">[AS]</a></sup> Popper's attacks were not directed toward Marxism, or Marx's theories, which were falsifiable, but toward Marxists who he considered to have ignored the falsifications which had happened.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESmith200012_93-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmith200012-93">[48]</a></sup> Popper more fundamentally criticized 'historicism' in the sense of any preordained prediction of history, given what he saw as our right, ability and responsibility to control our own destiny.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESmith200012_93-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmith200012-93">[48]</a></sup>

#### _McLean v. Arkansas_ case\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: McLean v. Arkansas case")\]

In the ruling of the _[McLean v. Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLean_v._Arkansas "McLean v. Arkansas")_ case, Judge [William Overton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Overton_(judge) "William Overton (judge)") used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that "[creation science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_science "Creation science")" was not scientific and should not be taught in [Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas "Arkansas") [public schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_school_(government_funded) "Public school (government funded)") as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [Michael Ruse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ruse "Michael Ruse") defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see [Pennock 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPennock2000), p. 5, and [Ruse 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFRuse2010)):

-   It is guided by natural law;
-   It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;
-   It is testable against the empirical world;
-   Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and
-   It is falsifiable.

In his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that:

> While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.

#### Daubert standard\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Daubert standard")\]

In several cases of the [United States Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court "United States Supreme Court"), the court described scientific methodology using the [five Daubert factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard "Daubert standard"), which include falsifiability.<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-98">[AU]</a></sup> The Daubert result cited Popper and other philosophers of science:

> Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether a theory or technique is scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact will be whether it can be (and has been) tested. _Scientific methodology today is based on generating hypotheses and testing them to see if they can be falsified; indeed, this methodology is what distinguishes science from other fields of human inquiry._ Green 645.

## Connections between statistical theories and falsifiability\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Connections between statistical theories and falsifiability")\]

Considering the specific detection procedure that was used in the neutrino experiment, without mentioning its probabilistic aspect, Popper wrote "it provided a test of the much more significant _falsifiable_ theory that such emitted neutrinos could be trapped in a certain way". In this manner, in his discussion of the neutrino experiment, Popper did not raise at all the probabilistic aspect of the experiment.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper19741038_79-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper19741038-79">[43]</a></sup> Together with Maxwell, who raised the problems of falsification in the experiment,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974299_78-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974299-78">[42]</a></sup> he was aware that some convention must be adopted to fix what it means to detect or not a neutrino in this probabilistic context. This is the third kind of decisions mentioned by Lakatos.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELakatos197825_101-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTELakatos197825-101">[52]</a></sup> For Popper and most philosophers, observations are theory impregnated. In this example, the theory that impregnates observations (and justifies that we conventionally accept the potential falsifier "no neutrino was detected") is statistical. In statistical language, the potential falsifier that can be statistically accepted (not rejected to say it more correctly) is typically the null hypothesis, as understood even in popular accounts on falsifiability.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWilkinson2013_102-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWilkinson2013-102">[53]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChiasma2017_103-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChiasma2017-103">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWigmore2017_104-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWigmore2017-104">[55]</a></sup>

Different ways are used by statisticians to draw conclusions about hypotheses on the basis of available evidence. [Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Aylmer_Fisher "Ronald Aylmer Fisher"), [Neyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Neyman "Jerzy Neyman") and [Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egon_Pearson "Egon Pearson") proposed approaches that require no prior probabilities on the hypotheses that are being studied. In contrast, [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference "Bayesian inference") emphasizes the importance of prior probabilities.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELehmann1993201_105-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTELehmann1993201-105">[56]</a></sup> But, as far as falsification as a yes/no procedure in Popper's methodology is concerned, any approach that provides a way to accept or not a potential falsifier can be used, including approaches that use Bayes' theorem and estimations of prior probabilities that are made using critical discussions and reasonable assumptions taken from the background knowledge.<sup id="cite_ref-anyapproachtofalsifyisok_106-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-anyapproachtofalsifyisok-106">[AX]</a></sup> There is no general rule that considers as falsified an hypothesis with small Bayesian revised probability, because as pointed out by [Mayo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Mayo "Deborah Mayo") and argued before by Popper, the individual outcomes described in detail will easily have very small probabilities under available evidence without being genuine anomalies.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMayo201882_107-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMayo201882-107">[57]</a></sup> Nevertheless, Mayo adds, "they can indirectly falsify hypotheses by adding a methodological falsification rule".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMayo201882_107-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMayo201882-107">[57]</a></sup> In general, Bayesian statistic can play a role in critical rationalism in the context of inductive logic,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHawthorne2018Sec._3.2_108-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHawthorne2018Sec._3.2-108">[58]</a></sup> which is said to be inductive because implications are generalized to conditional probabilities.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHawthorne2018Sec._2.1_109-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHawthorne2018Sec._2.1-109">[59]</a></sup> According to Popper and other philosophers such as [Colin Howson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Howson "Colin Howson"), Hume's argument precludes inductive logic, but only when the logic makes no use "of additional assumptions: in particular, about what is to be assigned positive prior probability".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHowson200088_110-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHowson200088-110">[60]</a></sup> Inductive logic itself is not precluded, especially not when it is a deductively valid application of Bayes' theorem that is used to evaluate the probabilities of the hypotheses using the observed data and what is assumed about the priors. Gelman and Shalizi mentioned that Bayes' statisticians do not have to disagree with the non-inductivists.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGelmanShalizi201326–27_111-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGelmanShalizi201326%E2%80%9327-111">[61]</a></sup>

Because statisticians often associate statistical inference with induction, Popper's philosophy is often said to have a hidden form of induction. For example, Mayo wrote "The falsifying hypotheses ... necessitate an evidence-transcending (inductive) statistical inference. This is hugely problematic for Popper".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMayo201883_112-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMayo201883-112">[62]</a></sup> Yet, also according to Mayo, Popper \[as a non-inductivist\] acknowledged the useful role of statistical inference in the falsification problems: she mentioned that Popper wrote her (in the context of falsification based on evidence) "I regret not studying statistics" and that her thought was then "not as much as I do".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMayo201886_113-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMayo201886-113">[63]</a></sup>

## Lakatos's falsificationism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Lakatos's falsificationism")\]

[Imre Lakatos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imre_Lakatos "Imre Lakatos") divided the problems of falsification in two categories. The first category corresponds to decisions that must be agreed upon by scientists before they can falsify a theory. The other category emerges when one tries to use falsifications and corroborations to explain [progress in science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_progress "Scientific progress"). Lakatos described four kind of falsificationisms in view of how they address these problems. **Dogmatic falsificationism** ignores both types of problems. **Methodological falsificationism** addresses the first type of problems by accepting that decisions must be taken by scientists. **Naive methodological falsificationism** or **naive falsificationism** does not do anything to address the second type of problems.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELakatos197812–30_114-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTELakatos197812%E2%80%9330-114">[64]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPera1989362_115-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPera1989362-115">[65]</a></sup> Lakatos used dogmatic and naive falsificationism to explain how Popper's philosophy changed over time and viewed **sophisticated falsificationism** as his own improvement on Popper's philosophy, but also said that Popper some times appears as a sophisticated falsificationist.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELakatos1974_116-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTELakatos1974-116">[66]</a></sup> Popper responded that Lakatos misrepresented his intellectual history with these terminological distinctions.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1974Note_70a_117-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1974Note_70a-117">[67]</a></sup>

### Dogmatic falsificationism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Dogmatic falsificationism")\]

A dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory-impregnated. Being theory-impregnated means that it goes beyond direct experience. For example, the statement "Here is a glass of water" goes beyond experience, because the concepts of glass and water "denote physical bodies which exhibit a certain law-like behaviour" (Popper).<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAndersson1994Chap_3_118-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAndersson1994Chap_3-118">[68]</a></sup> This leads to the critique that it is unclear which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<sup id="cite_ref-duhemcritic_119-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-duhemcritic-119">[AY]</a></sup> This is sometimes called the '[Duhem–Quine problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis "Duhem–Quine thesis")'. [An example is Galileo's refutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhem%E2%80%93Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy "Duhem–Quine thesis") of the theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. Another example is the theory that neutrinos are emitted in [beta decays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay "Beta decay"). Had they not been observed in the [Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowan%E2%80%93Reines_neutrino_experiment "Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment"), many would have considered that the strength of the [beta-inverse reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_beta_decay "Inverse beta decay") used to detect the neutrinos was not sufficiently high. At the time, [Grover Maxwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grover_Maxwell&action=edit&redlink=1 "Grover Maxwell (page does not exist)") <sup>&nbsp;[<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Maxwell" title="es:Grover Maxwell">es</a>]</sup> wrote, the possibility that this strength was sufficiently high was a "pious hope".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974299_78-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMaxwell1974299-78">[42]</a></sup>

A dogmatic falsificationist ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses. The assumptions or auxiliary hypotheses of a particular test are all the hypotheses that are assumed to be accurate in order for the test to work as planned.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEUnderstanding_Science2021_120-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEUnderstanding_Science2021-120">[69]</a></sup> The predicted observation that is contradicted depends on the theory and these auxiliary hypotheses. Again, this leads to the critique that it cannot be told if it is the theory or one of the required auxiliary hypotheses that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.

Lakatos says that Popper's solution to these criticisms requires that one relaxes the assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false:<sup id="cite_ref-twomeanings_6-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-twomeanings-6">[F]</a></sup>

> If a theory is falsified \[in the usual sense\], it is proven false; if it is 'falsified' \[in the technical sense\], it may still be true.
> 
> — Imre Lakatos, [Lakatos 1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFLakatos1978), p. 24

**Methodological falsificationism** replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a "contradicting observation" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies four kinds of decisions that have these respective goals: the selection of all _basic statements_ (statements that correspond to logically possible observations), selection of the _accepted basic statements_ among the basic statements, making statistical laws falsifiable and applying the refutation to the specific theory (instead of an auxiliary hypothesis).<sup id="cite_ref-twootherdecisions_121-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-twootherdecisions-121">[AZ]</a></sup> The experimental falsifiers and falsifications thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory.

### Naive falsificationism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Naive falsificationism")\]

According to Lakatos, naive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how scientific knowledge progresses. Very often a theory is still useful and used even after it is found in contradiction with some observations. Also, when scientists deal with two or more competing theories which are both corroborated, considering only falsifications, it is not clear why one theory is chosen above the other, even when one is corroborated more often than the other. In fact, a stronger version of the Quine-Duhem thesis says that it is not always possible to rationally pick one theory over the other using falsifications.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELakatos197896–97_122-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTELakatos197896%E2%80%9397-122">[70]</a></sup> Considering only falsifications, it is not clear why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's critical rationalism uses both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<sup id="cite_ref-poppernonnaive_123-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-poppernonnaive-123">[BA]</a></sup> How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<sup id="cite_ref-popper01and2_124-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-popper01and2-124">[BB]</a></sup>

Popper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [verisimilitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisimilitude "Verisimilitude"), a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to describe a concept already clear in practice.

### From the problem of induction to falsificationism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: From the problem of induction to falsificationism")\]

Hume explained induction with a theory of the mind<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMorrisBrown2021Sec._4_134-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMorrisBrown2021Sec._4-134">[72]</a></sup> that was in part inspired by Newton's theory of gravitation.<sup id="cite_ref-Humegravitationalmind_135-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-Humegravitationalmind-135">[BK]</a></sup> Popper rejected Hume's explanation of induction and proposed his own mechanism: science progresses by trial and error within an evolutionary epistemology. Hume believed that his psychological induction process follows laws of nature, but, for him, this does not imply the existence of a method of justification based on logical rules. In fact, he argued that any induction mechanism, including the mechanism described by his theory, could not be justified logically.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHenderson2018_136-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHenderson2018-136">[73]</a></sup> Similarly, Popper adopted an evolutionary epistemology, which implies that some laws explain progress in science, but yet insists that the process of trial and error is hardly rigorous and that there is always an element of irrationality in the creative process of science. The absence of a method of justification is a built-in aspect of Popper's trial and error explanation.

As rational as they can be, these explanations that refer to laws, but cannot be turned into methods of justification (and thus do not contradict Hume's argument or its premises), were not sufficient for some philosophers. In particular, [Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") once expressed the view that if Hume's problem cannot be solved, “there is no intellectual difference between sanity and insanity”<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHenderson2018_136-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHenderson2018-136">[73]</a></sup> and actually proposed a method of justification.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERussell1998Chap._VI_137-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussell1998Chap._VI-137">[74]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERussell1948Part_VI,_Sec._II_138-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTERussell1948Part_VI,_Sec._II-138">[75]</a></sup> He rejected Hume's premise that there is a need to justify any principle that is itself used to justify induction.<sup id="cite_ref-Russellinductiveprinciples_139-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-Russellinductiveprinciples-139">[BL]</a></sup> It might seem that this premise is hard to reject, but to avoid circular reasoning we do reject it in the case of deductive logic. It makes sense to also reject this premise in the case of principles to justify induction. Lakatos's proposal of sophisticated falsificationism was very natural in that context.

Therefore, Lakatos urged Popper to find an inductive principle behind the trial and error learning process<sup id="cite_ref-zaharonlakatosurgedpoppertouseinduction_140-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-zaharonlakatosurgedpoppertouseinduction-140">[BM]</a></sup> and sophisticated falsificationism was his own approach to address this challenge.<sup id="cite_ref-LakatosrationalinPopperviewvsKuhn_141-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-LakatosrationalinPopperviewvsKuhn-141">[BN]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-LakatosrationalinPopperview_142-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-LakatosrationalinPopperview-142">[BO]</a></sup> Kuhn, Feyerabend, Musgrave and others mentioned and Lakatos himself acknowledged that, as a method of justification, this attempt failed, because there was no normative methodology to justify—Lakatos's methodology was anarchy in disguise.<sup id="cite_ref-LakatosRetractOnInductivism_143-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-LakatosRetractOnInductivism-143">[BP]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Lakatosanarchist_144-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-Lakatosanarchist-144">[BQ]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-MusgraveLakatosanarchist_145-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-MusgraveLakatosanarchist-145">[BR]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FeyerabendOnLakatosUseJudgement_146-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FeyerabendOnLakatosUseJudgement-146">[BS]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-lakatosmethodologybasedonjudgment_147-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-lakatosmethodologybasedonjudgment-147">[BT]</a></sup>

### Falsificationism in Popper's philosophy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Falsificationism in Popper's philosophy")\]

Popper's philosophy is sometimes said to fail to recognize the Quine-Duhem thesis, which would make it a form of dogmatic falsificationism. For example, Watkins wrote "apparently forgetting that he had once said 'Duhem is right \[...\]', Popper set out to devise potential falsifiers just for Newton's fundamental assumptions".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWatkins1984Sec_8.5_148-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWatkins1984Sec_8.5-148">[76]</a></sup> But, Popper's philosophy is not always qualified of falsificationism in the pejorative manner associated with dogmatic or naive falsificationism.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChalmers201359_149-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChalmers201359-149">[77]</a></sup> The problems of falsification are acknowledged by the falsificationists. For example, Chalmers points out that falsificationists freely admit that observation is theory impregnated.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEChalmers201360_150-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChalmers201360-150">[78]</a></sup> Thornton, referring to Popper's methodology, says that the predictions inferred from conjectures are not directly compared with the facts simply because all observation-statements are theory-laden.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEThornton2016Sec_5_151-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEThornton2016Sec_5-151">[79]</a></sup> For the critical rationalists, the problems of falsification are not an issue, because they do not try to make experimental falsifications logical or to logically justify them, nor to use them to logically explain progress in science. Instead, their faith rests on critical discussions around these experimental falsifications.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1972_15-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1972-15">[4]</a></sup> Lakatos made a distinction between a "falsification" (with quotation marks) in Popper's philosophy and a falsification (without quotation marks) that can be used in a systematic methodology where rejections are justified.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELakatos197836_152-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTELakatos197836-152">[80]</a></sup> He knew that Popper's philosophy is not and has never been about this kind of justification, but he felt that it should have been.<sup id="cite_ref-zaharonlakatosurgedpoppertouseinduction_140-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-zaharonlakatosurgedpoppertouseinduction-140">[BM]</a></sup> Sometimes, Popper and other falsificationists say that when a theory is falsified it is rejected,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper1962Chap._1;_Sec_IX_153-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1962Chap._1;_Sec_IX-153">[81]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMiller19947_154-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller19947-154">[82]</a></sup> which appears as dogmatic falsificationism, but the general context is always critical rationalism in which all decisions are open to critical discussions and can be revised.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGarcia200630_155-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGarcia200630-155">[83]</a></sup>

## Controversies\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Controversies")\]

### Methodless creativity versus inductive methodology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Methodless creativity versus inductive methodology")\]

As described in section [§ Naive falsificationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Naive_falsificationism), Lakatos and Popper agreed that universal laws cannot be logically deduced (except from laws that say even more). But unlike Popper, Lakatos felt that if the explanation for new laws cannot be deductive, it must be inductive. He urged Popper explicitly to adopt some inductive principle<sup id="cite_ref-zaharonlakatosurgedpoppertouseinduction_140-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-zaharonlakatosurgedpoppertouseinduction-140">[BM]</a></sup> and sets himself the task to find an inductive methodology.<sup id="cite_ref-LakatosAnnouncesInductiveRules_156-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-LakatosAnnouncesInductiveRules-156">[BU]</a></sup> However, the methodology that he found did not offer any exact inductive rules. In a response to Kuhn, Feyerabend and Musgrave, Lakatos acknowledged that the methodology depends on the good judgment of the scientists.<sup id="cite_ref-LakatosRetractOnInductivism_143-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-LakatosRetractOnInductivism-143">[BP]</a></sup> Feyerabend wrote in "Against Method" that Lakatos's methodology of scientific research programmes is epistemological anarchism in disguise<sup id="cite_ref-Lakatosanarchist_144-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-Lakatosanarchist-144">[BQ]</a></sup> and Musgrave made a similar comment.<sup id="cite_ref-MusgraveLakatosanarchist_145-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-MusgraveLakatosanarchist-145">[BR]</a></sup> In more recent work, Feyerabend says that Lakatos uses rules, but whether or not to follow any of these rules is left to the judgment of the scientists.<sup id="cite_ref-FeyerabendOnLakatosUseJudgement_146-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FeyerabendOnLakatosUseJudgement-146">[BS]</a></sup> This is also discussed elsewhere.<sup id="cite_ref-lakatosmethodologybasedonjudgment_147-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-lakatosmethodologybasedonjudgment-147">[BT]</a></sup>

Popper also offered a methodology with rules, but these rules are also not-inductive rules, because they are not by themselves used to accept laws or establish their validity. They do that through the creativity or "good judgment" of the scientists only. For Popper, the required non deductive component of science never had to be an inductive methodology. He always viewed this component as a creative process beyond the explanatory reach of any rational methodology, but yet used to decide which theories should be studied and applied, find good problems and guess useful conjectures.<sup id="cite_ref-zaharoncreativedecisions_157-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-zaharoncreativedecisions-157">[BV]</a></sup> Quoting Einstein to support his view, Popper said that this renders obsolete the need for an inductive methodology or logical path to the laws.<sup id="cite_ref-158"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-158">[BW]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-einsteinnologicalpath_159-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-einsteinnologicalpath-159">[BX]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-einsteinoncreativityandmathematics_160-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-einsteinoncreativityandmathematics-160">[BY]</a></sup> For Popper, no inductive methodology was ever proposed to satisfactorily explain science.

### Ahistorical versus historiographical\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Ahistorical versus historiographical")\]

Section [§ Methodless creativity versus inductive methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Methodless_creativity_versus_inductive_methodology) says that both Lakatos's and Popper's methodology are not inductive. Yet Lakatos's methodology extended importantly Popper's methodology: it added a historiographical component to it. This allowed Lakatos to find corroborations for his methodology in the history of science. The basic units in his methodology, which can be abandoned or pursued, are research programmes. Research programmes can be degenerative or progressive and only degenerative research programmes must be abandoned at some point. For Lakatos, this is mostly corroborated by facts in history.

In contradistinction, Popper did not propose his methodology as a tool to reconstruct the history of science. Yet, some times, he did refer to history to corroborate his methodology. For example, he remarked that theories that were considered great successes were also the most likely to be falsified. Zahar's view was that, with regard to corroborations found in the history of science, there was only a difference of emphasis between Popper and Lakatos.

As an anecdotal example, in one of his articles Lakatos challenged Popper to show that his theory was falsifiable: he asked "Under what conditions would you give up your demarcation criterion?".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELakatos1974245_161-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTELakatos1974245-161">[84]</a></sup> Popper replied "I shall give up my theory if Professor Lakatos succeeds in showing that Newton's theory is no more falsifiable by 'observable states of affairs' than is Freud's."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPopper19741010_162-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper19741010-162">[85]</a></sup> According to David Stove, Lakatos succeeded, since Lakatos showed there is no such thing as a "non-Newtonian" behaviour of an observable object. Stove argued that Popper's counterexamples to Lakatos were either instances of [begging the question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question "Begging the question"), such as Popper's example of missiles moving in a "non-Newtonian track", or consistent with Newtonian physics, such as objects not falling to the ground without "obvious" countervailing forces against Earth's gravity.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStove198292_46-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStove198292-46">[24]</a></sup>

### Normal science versus revolutionary science\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Normal science versus revolutionary science")\]

[Thomas Kuhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn "Thomas Kuhn") analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKuhn1996_163-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKuhn1996-163">[86]</a></sup> whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<sup id="cite_ref-kuhnonpoppersviewonrevolution_164-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-kuhnonpoppersviewonrevolution-164">[BZ]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-watkinsonPopperVsKuhn_165-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-watkinsonPopperVsKuhn-165">[CA]</a></sup> For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge, is to solve puzzles.<sup id="cite_ref-knowledgebeginswithproblems_166-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-knowledgebeginswithproblems-166">[CB]</a></sup> In the same line of thought, Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which represent some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It is only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [§ Naive falsificationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Naive_falsificationism)). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory. Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.

### Unfalsifiability versus falsity of astrology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Unfalsifiability versus falsity of astrology")\]

Popper often uses astrology as an example of a pseudoscience. He says that it is not falsifiable because both the theory itself and its predictions are too imprecise.<sup id="cite_ref-astrologysouthsayerstrick_167-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-astrologysouthsayerstrick-167">[CC]</a></sup> Kuhn, as an historian of science, remarked that many predictions made by astrologers in the past were quite precise and they were very often falsified. He also said that astrologers themselves acknowledged these falsifications.<sup id="cite_ref-khunastrologynonapplicabilityoffalsifiability_168-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-khunastrologynonapplicabilityoffalsifiability-168">[CD]</a></sup>

### Epistemological anarchism vs the scientific method\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: Epistemological anarchism vs the scientific method")\]

[Paul Feyerabend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend "Paul Feyerabend") rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos's argument for [_ad hoc_ hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_hypothesis "Ad hoc hypothesis"), arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMartin2017_169-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMartin2017-169">[87]</a></sup> He said that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [epistemological anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemological_anarchism "Epistemological anarchism") or _anything goes_ would be the only candidate.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFeyerabend1993_170-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFeyerabend1993-170">[88]</a></sup> For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have, derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBroad1979_171-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBroad1979-171">[89]</a></sup>

### Sokal and Bricmont\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falsifiability&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Sokal and Bricmont")\]

In their book _[Fashionable Nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashionable_Nonsense "Fashionable Nonsense")_ (from 1997, published in the UK as _Intellectual Impostures_) the physicists [Alan Sokal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sokal "Alan Sokal") and [Jean Bricmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bricmont "Jean Bricmont") criticised falsifiability.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESokalBricmont1998_172-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTESokalBricmont1998-172">[90]</a></sup> They include this critique in the "Intermezzo" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism. Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's description of falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMiller2000_173-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMiller2000-173">[91]</a></sup>

1.  ^ [Jump up to: <sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-Popperonstateofaffairs_1-0) [<sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-Popperonstateofaffairs_1-1) Popper discusses the notion of imaginary state of affairs in the context of scientific realism in [Popper 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1972), Chap.2, Sec.5: (emphasis added) "\[H\]uman language is essentially descriptive (and argumentative), and an unambiguous description is always realistic: it is of something—of some state of affairs which may be real or **imaginary**. Thus if the state of affairs is imaginary, then the description is simply false and its negation is a true description of reality, in Tarski's sense." He continues (emphasis added) "Tarski's theory more particularly makes clear just what fact a statement P will correspond to if it corresponds to any fact: namely the fact that p. ... a false statement P is false not because it corresponds to some odd entity like a non-fact, but simply because it does not correspond to any fact: it does not stand in the peculiar relation of correspondence to a fact to anything real, though it stands in a relation like 'describes' to the **spurious** state of affairs that p."
2.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-faithfultranslationofLoSD_2-0 "Jump up")** Popper wanted the main text of the 1959 English version, _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_, to conform to the original, thus refused to make substantial corrections and only added notes and appendices and marked them with an asterisk (see [Popper 1959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959), Translators' note).
3.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-basicstatementsbreakthesymmetry_3-0 "Jump up")** The falsifiability criterion is formulated in terms of basic statements or observation statements without requiring that we know which ones of these observation statements correspond to actual facts. These basic statements break the symmetry, while being purely logical concepts.
4.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-blackswanimpossible_4-0 "Jump up")** "All swans are white" is often chosen as an example of a falsifiable statement, because for some 1500 years, the [black swan existed in the European imagination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_emblems_and_popular_culture#European_myth_and_metaphor "Black swan emblems and popular culture") as a [metaphor for that which could not exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory "Black swan theory"). Had the presumption concerning black swans in this metaphor be right, the statement would still have been falsifiable.

The logic of his theory is utterly simple: if a single ferrous metal is unaffected by a magnetic field it cannot be the case that all ferrous metals are affected by magnetic fields. Logically speaking, a scientific law is conclusively falsifiable although it is not conclusively verifiable. Methodologically, however, the situation is much more complex: no observation is free from the possibility of error—consequently we may question whether our experimental result was what it appeared to be."

    "1) _Falsifiable_ as a logical-technical term, in the sense of the demarcation criterion of falsifiability. This purely logical concept—falsifiable in principle, one might say—rests on a logical relation between the theory in question and the class of basic statements (or the potential falsifiers described by them).  
    "2) _Falsifiable_ in the sense that the theory in question can definitively or conclusively or demonstrably be falsified ("demonstrably falsifiable").  
    "I have always stressed that even a theory which is obviously falsifiable in the first sense is never falsifiable in this second sense. (For this reason I have used the expression _falsifiable_ as a rule only in the first, technical sense. In the second sense, I have as a rule spoken not of _falsifiability_ but rather of _falsification_ and of its problems)."

But anything like conclusive proof to settle an empirical question does not exist. An entire literature rests on the failure to observe this distinction." For a discussion related to this lack of distinction, see [Rosende 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFRosende2009), p. 142.
8.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-falsifiabilityasfalsificationproblems_10-0 "Jump up")** Falsifiability does not require falsification. A past, present and even a future falsification would be a problematic requirement: it cannot be achieved, because definitive rigorous falsifications are impossible and, if a theory nevertheless met this requirement, it would not be much better than a falsified theory.
9.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-inductionisalogicalfallacy_11-0 "Jump up")** Popper's argument is that inductive inference is a fallacy : "I hold with Hume that there simply is no such logical entity as an inductive inference; or, that all so-called inductive inferences are logically invalid".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGreenland1998545_174-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGreenland1998545-174">[92]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGrayling2019397_12-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrayling2019397-12">[3]</a></sup>
10.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-neveruseinduction_13-0 "Jump up")** [Popper 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1983), chap. 1, sec. 3: "It seems that almost everybody believes in induction; believes, that is, that we learn by the repetition of observations. Even Hume, in spite of his great discovery that a natural law can neither be established nor made 'probable' by induction, continued to believe firmly that animals and men do learn through repetition: through repeated observations as well as through the formation of habits, or the strengthening of habits, by repetition. And he upheld the theory that induction, though rationally indefensible and resulting in nothing better than unreasoned belief, was nevertheless reliable in the main—more reliable and useful at any rate than reason and the processes of reasoning; and that 'experience' was thus the unreasoned result of a (more or less passive) accumulation of observations. As against all this, I happen to believe that in fact we never draw inductive inferences, or make use of what are now called 'inductive procedures'. Rather, we always discover regularities by the essentially different method of trial and error."
11.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-inductionnotneeded_14-0 "Jump up")** [Popper 1959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959), part I, chap. 2, sec. 11: "\[I\] dispense with the principle of induction: not because such a principle is as a matter of fact never used in science, but because I think that it is not needed; that it does not help us; and that it even gives rise to inconsistencies."
12.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-OneThousandFoldAdler_20-0 "Jump up")** [Popper 1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1962), p. 35: "As for Adler, I was much impressed by a personal experience. Once, in 1919, I reported to him a case which to me did not seem particularly Adlerian, but which he found no difficulty in analysing in terms of his theory of inferiority feelings, although he had not even seen the child. Slightly shocked, I asked him how he could be so sure. 'Because of my thousandfold experience,' he replied; whereupon I could not help saying: 'And with this new case, I suppose, your experience has become thousand-and-one-fold.'"
13.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-thorntonbetterifcorroborated_21-0 "Jump up")** [Thornton 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFThornton2007), p. 3: "However, a theory that has successfully withstood critical testing is thereby 'corroborated', and may be regarded as being preferable to falsified rivals. In the case of rival unfalsified theories, for Popper, the higher the informative content of a theory the better it is scientifically, because every gain in content brings with it a commensurate gain in predictive scope and testability."
14.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-popperbetterifcorroborated_22-0 "Jump up")** [Popper 1959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959), p. 19: "Various objections might be raised against the criterion of demarcation here proposed. In the first place, it may well seem somewhat wrong-headed to suggest that science, which is supposed to give us positive information, should be characterized as satisfying a negative requirement such as refutability. However, I shall show, in sections 31 to 46, that this objection has little weight, since the amount of positive information about the world which is conveyed by a scientific statement is the greater the more likely it is to clash, because of its logical character, with possible singular statements. (Not for nothing do we call the laws of nature 'laws': the more they prohibit the more they say.)"
15.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-britannicameaningvstestability_23-0 "Jump up")** [Feigl 1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFFeigl1978): "Karl Popper, an Austrian-born British philosopher of science, in his Logik der Forschung (1935; The Logic of Scientific Discovery), insisted that the meaning criterion should be abandoned and replaced by a criterion of demarcation between empirical (scientific) and transempirical (nonscientific, metaphysical) questions and answers—a criterion that, according to Popper, is to be testability."
16.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-Popperpsychologyshouldbebiology_29-0 "Jump up")** [Popper 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1972), Sec. 1.9: "Quite apart from \[Hume's psychological theory of induction\], I felt that psychology should be regarded as a biological discipline, and especially that any psychological theory of the acquisition of knowledge should be so regarded. Now if we transfer to human and animal psychology \[the method that consists in choosing the best tested theory among conjectured theories\], we arrive, clearly, at the well-known method of trial and error-elimination."

Its questions are of the following kind. Can a statement be justified? And if so, how? Is it testable? Is it logically dependent on certain other statements? Or does it perhaps contradict them? In order that a statement may be logically examined in this way, it must already have been presented to us. Someone must have formulated it, and submitted it to logical examination."
19.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-Popperabouthisnegativemethodology_35-0 "Jump up")** [Popper 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1972), Sec. 1.8: "The fundamental difference between my approach and the approach for which I long ago introduced the label 'inductivist' is that I lay stress on negative arguments, such as negative instances or counter-examples, refutations, and attempted refutations—in short, criticism".

21.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-invisiblestrings_41-0 "Jump up")** In a spirit of criticism, [Watkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._N._Watkins "John W. N. Watkins") ([Watkins1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFWatkins1984), Sec. 8.52) liked to refer to invisible strings instead of some abstract law to explain this kind of evidence against Newton's Gravity.
22.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-thematerialrequirement_42-0 "Jump up")** The requirement that the language must be empirical is known in the literature as the material requirement. For example, see [Nola & Sankey 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFNolaSankey2014), pp. 256, 268 and [Shea 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFShea2020), Sec 2.c. This requirement says that the statements that describe observations, the basic statements, must be [intersubjectively verifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjective_verifiability "Intersubjective verifiability").
23.  ^ [Jump up to: <sup><i><b>a</b></i></sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-fourlinesoftesting_47-0) [<sup><i><b>b</b></i></sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-fourlinesoftesting_47-1) In Popper's description of the scientific procedure of testing, as explained by Thornton (see [Thornton 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFThornton2016), Sec. 4), there is no discussion of factual observations except in those tests that compare the theory with factual observations, but in these tests too the procedure is mostly logical and involves observations that are only logical constructions ([Popper 1959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959), pp. 9–10): "We may if we like distinguish four different lines along which the testing of a theory could be carried out. First there is the logical comparison of the conclusions among themselves, by which the internal consistency of the system is tested. Secondly, there is the investigation of the logical form of the theory, with the object of determining whether it has the character of an empirical or scientific theory, or whether it is, for example, tautological. Thirdly, there is the comparison with other theories, chiefly with the aim of determining whether the theory would constitute a scientific advance should it survive our various tests. And finally, there is the testing of the theory by way of empirical applications of the conclusions which can be derived from it. ... Here too the procedure of testing turns out to be deductive. With the help of other statements, previously accepted, certain singular statements—which we may call 'predictions'—are deduced from the theory; especially predictions that are easily testable or applicable. From among these statements, those are selected which are not derivable from the current theory, and more especially those which the current theory contradicts."
24.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-poppernoapriori_48-0 "Jump up")** [Popper 1959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959), p. 9: "According to the view that will be put forward here, the method of critically testing theories, and selecting them according to the results of tests, always proceeds on the following lines. From a new idea, put up tentatively, and not yet justified in any way—an anticipation, a hypothesis, a theoretical system, or what you will—conclusions are drawn by means of logical deduction. These conclusions are then compared with one another and with other relevant statements, so as to find what logical relations (such as equivalence, derivability, compatibility, or incompatibility) exist between them."
25.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-keuthbasicstatementsdependontechnology_50-0 "Jump up")** In practice, technologies change. When the interpretation of a theory is modified by an improved technological interpretation of some properties, the new theory can be seen as the same theory with an enlarged scope. For example, [Herbert Keuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herbert_Keuth&action=edit&redlink=1 "Herbert Keuth (page does not exist)") <sup>&nbsp;[<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Keuth" title="de:Herbert Keuth">de</a>]</sup>, ([Keuth 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFKeuth2005), p. 43) wrote: "But Popper's falsifiability or testability criterion does not presuppose that a definite distinction between testable and non testable statement is possible ... technology changes. Thus _a hypotheses that was first untestable may become testable later on_."
26.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements_52-0 "Jump up")** [Popper 1959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959), section 7, page 21: "If falsifiability is to be at all applicable as a criterion of demarcation, then singular statements must be available which can serve as premisses in falsifying inferences. Our criterion therefore appears only to shift the problem—to lead us back from the question of the empirical character of theories to the question of the empirical character of singular statements.  
    "Yet even so, something has been gained. For in the practice of scientific research, demarcation is sometimes of immediate urgency in connection with theoretical systems, whereas in connection with singular statements, doubt as to their empirical character rarely arises. It is true that errors of observation occur and that they give rise to false singular statements, but the scientist scarcely ever has occasion to describe a singular statement as non-empirical or metaphysical."

In introducing the term 'empirical basis' my intention was, partly, to give an ironical emphasis to my thesis that the empirical basis of our theories is far from firm; that it should be compared to a swamp rather than to solid ground."

This equivalence principle conflicts with many potential falsifiers: events whose observation is logically possible. Yet despite all attempts (the experiments by Eötvös, more recently refined by Rickle) to realize such a falsification experimentally, the experiments have so far corroborated the principle of equivalence."

The tautology is said to arise from the fact that evolutionary biologists have no widely accepted way to independently define 'survival' and 'fitness.' That the statement, 'the fit survive,' is tautological is important, because if the critics are correct in their analysis, the tautology renders meaningless much of contemporary evolutionary theorizing. ... The definition of key evolutionary concepts in terms of natural selection runs the risk of making evolutionary theory a self-contained, logical system which is isolated from the empirical world. No meaningful empirical prediction can be made from one side to the other side of these definitions. One cannot usefully predict that nature selects the fittest organism since the fittest organism is by definition that which nature selects."

Natural selection, which was at first considered as though it were a hypothesis that was in need of experimental or observational confirmation, turns out on closer inspection to be a tautology, a statement of an inevitable, although previously unrecognized, relation. It states that the fittest individuals in a population (defined as those which leave most offspring) will leave most offspring. Once the statement is made, its truth is apparent. This fact in no way reduces the magnitude of Darwin's achievement; only after it was clearly formulated, could biologists realize the enormous power of the principle as a weapon of explanation."

While it is mathematically tractable and easy to model in the laboratory, the concept is difficult to operationalize in the field. For field biologists, it is really a hypothetical entity. Clear, unambiguous instances of the operation of natural selection are difficult to come by and always greeted with great enthusiasm by biologists (Kettlewell, 1959 \[the case of the peppered moths\]; Shepherd, 1960). Thus, although the concept has much to recommend it as an explanatory one, it seems an overly abstract formulation on which to base a descriptive science."

There are some tests, even some experimental tests; and in some cases, such as the famous phenomenon known as "industrial melanism", we can observe natural selection happening under our very eyes, as it were. Nevertheless, really severe tests of the theory of natural selection are hard to come by, much more so than tests of otherwise comparable theories in physics or chemistry."

Yet instead of accepting the refutations the followers of Marx re-interpreted both the theory and the evidence in order to make them agree. In this way they rescued the theory from refutation; but they did so at the price of adopting a device which made it irrefutable. They thus gave a 'conventionalist twist' to the theory; and by this stratagem they destroyed its much advertised claim to scientific status."

But this criticism overlooks the fact that if we take each of the two theories (between which the crucial experiment is to decide) together with all this background knowledge, as indeed we must, then we decide between two systems which differ only over the two theories which are at stake. It further overlooks the fact that we do not assert the refutation of the theory as such, but of the theory together with that background knowledge; parts of which, if other crucial experiments can be designed, may indeed one day be rejected as responsible for the failure. (Thus we may even characterize a theory under investigation as that part of a vast system for which we have, if vaguely, an alternative in mind, and for which we try to design crucial tests.)"

The preference is certainly not due to anything like a experiential justification of the statements composing the theory; it is not due to a logical reduction of the theory to experience. We choose the theory which best holds its own in competition with other theories; the one which, by natural selection, proves itself the fittest to survive. This will be the one which not only has hitherto stood up to the severest tests, but the one which is also testable in the most rigorous way. A theory is a tool which we test by applying it, and which we judge as to its fitness by the results of its applications."

Popper0 is the dogmatic falsificationist ... Popper1 is the naive falsificationist, Popper2 the sophisticated falsificationist. ... The real Popper has never explained in detail the appeal procedure by which some 'accepted basic statements', may be eliminated.

He says (see [Zahar 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFZahar1983), p. 149): "The important question of the possibility of a genuine logic of \[scientific\] discovery" is the main divergence between Lakatos and Popper. About Popper's view, Zahar wrote (see [Zahar 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFZahar1983), p. 169): "To repeat: Popper offers a Darwinian account of the progress of knowledge. Progress is supposed to result negatively from the elimination by natural selection of defective alternatives. ... There is no genuine logic of discovery, only a psychology of invention juxtaposed to a methodology which appraises fully fledged theories."
58.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-naivefalsificationism_128-0 "Jump up")** In Lakatos terminology, the term "falsified" has a different meaning for a naive falsificationist than for a sophisticated falsificationist. Putting aside this confusing terminological aspect, the key point is that Lakatos wanted a formal logical procedure to determine which theories we must keep (see [Lakatos 1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFLakatos1978), p. 32): "For the naive falsificationist a theory is falsified by a ('fortified') 'observational' statement which conflicts with it (or which he decides to interpret as conflicting with it). For the sophisticated falsificationist a scientific theory T is falsified if and only if another theory T' has been proposed with the following characteristics: ( 1 ) T' has excess empirical content over T: that is, it predicts novel facts, that is, facts improbable in the light of, or even forbidden, by (2) T' explains the previous success of T, that is, all the unrefuted content of T is included (within the limits of observational error) in the content of T'; and (3) some of the excess content of T' is corroborated."

A 'good reason' may be, for instance: replacement of the hypothesis by another which is better testable; or the falsification of one of the consequences of the hypothesis.'  
    Rules like these, and with them the entire logical enterprise described above, are no longer simply syntactic in their import. They require that both the epistemological investigator and the research scientist be able to relate sentences derived from a theory not to other sentences but to actual observations and experiments. This is the context in which Sir Karl's term 'falsification' must function, and Sir Karl is entirely silent about how it can do so."

Otherwise, _he has told us nothing at all_.' Actually, I do specify such criteria. But Kuhn probably meant that '\[my\] standards have practical force only if they are combined with a time limit (what looks like a degenerating problem shift may be the beginning of a much longer period of advance)'. Since I specify no such time limit, Feyerabend concludes that my standards are no more than 'verbal ornament'. A related point was made by Musgrave in a letter containing some major constructive criticisms of an earlier draft, in which he demanded that I specify, for instance, at what point dogmatic adherence to a programme ought to be explained 'externally' rather than 'internally'. Let me try to explain why such objections are beside the point. One may rationally stick to a degenerating programme until it is overtaken by a rival and even after. What one must not do is to deny its poor public record. Both Feyerabend and Kuhn conflate methodological appraisal of a programme with firm heuristic advice about what to do. It is perfectly rational to play a risky game: what is irrational is to deceive oneself about the risk. This does not mean as much licence as might appear for those who stick to a degenerating programme. For they can do this mostly only in private."

In a certain sense, therefore, I hold it true that pure thought can grasp reality, as the ancients dreamed."

His emphasis is natural and common: the exploits of a Copernicus or Einstein make better reading than those of a Brahe or Lorentz; Sir Karl would not be the first if he mistook what I call normal science for an intrinsically uninteresting enterprise. Nevertheless, neither science nor the development of knowledge is likely to be understood if research is viewed exclusively through the revolutions it occasionally produces."

Popper has suggested that the motto of science should be: Revolution in permanence! For Kuhn, it seems, a more appropriate maxim would be: Not nostrums but normalcy!"

The progress of science lies, essentially, in the evolution of its problems. And it can be gauged by the increasing refinement, wealth, fertility, and depth of its problems. ... The growth of knowledge always consists in correcting earlier knowledge. Historically, science begins with pre-scientific knowledge, with pre-scientific myths and pre-scientific expectations. And these, in turn, have no 'beginnings'."

In order to escape falsification they destroyed the testability of their theory. It is a typical soothsayer's trick to predict things so vaguely that the predictions can hardly fail: that they become irrefutable."
82.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#cite_ref-khunastrologynonapplicabilityoffalsifiability_168-0 "Jump up")** [Kuhn 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#CITEREFKuhn1970), pp. [7–8](https://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&pg=PA7): "Astrology is Sir Karl's most frequently cited example of a 'pseudo-science'. He \[Popper\] says: 'By making their interpretations and prophecies sufficiently vague they \[astrologers\] were able to explain away anything that might have been a refutation of the theory had the theory and the prophecies been more precise. In order to escape falsification they destroyed the testability of the theory.' Those generalizations catch something of the spirit of the astrological enterprise. But taken at all literally, as they must be if they are to provide a demarcation criterion, they are impossible to support. The history of astrology during the centuries when it was intellectually reputable records many predictions that categorically failed. Not even astrology's most convinced and vehement exponents doubted the recurrence of such failures. Astrology cannot be barred from the sciences because of the form in which its predictions were cast."
