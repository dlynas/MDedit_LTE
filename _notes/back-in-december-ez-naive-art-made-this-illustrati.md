## Back in December, @ez.naive.art made this illustration for a collaborative post we did. I couldn’t stop crying and still can’t. I feel like I have run out of things to say, so here’s what I wrote back then:

“Our tears and our grief are potent medicine that can water the seeds of hope for a better world. My grief tells me ‘What has happened here / what is happening is not okay.’ My grief propels me onwards towards imagining and creating better worlds.

To everyone out there that is crying all the time, whose hearts break anew every day, multiple times during the day, I see you. We must keep our hearts open to this grief. For our tears are a testament that we won’t give up until everyone is free.”

@ez.naive.art has turned this image into a print with 100% of profits going to various humanitarian aid for 🍉🍉. So if you’ve been looking for a way to offer support and feel like you could use this reminder in your space, head to their page for the 🔗🔗🔗

Drop some 💦 in the comments if you’re really feeling the grief right now. And if you’ve been keeping it at bay, I hope that this post can offer some encouragement to welcome the grief as a wise teacher and medicine — in this moment and always.

I love you and I am crying and grieving and fighting alongside you 🫂🫂🫂
