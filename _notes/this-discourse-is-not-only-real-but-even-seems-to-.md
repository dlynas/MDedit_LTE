## This discourse is not only real, but even seems to be the main campaigning strategy of Vote Blue-liberals to try and guilt-trip us into voting for genocide üíÄ

EDIT: ..... i can't believe that I have to say this, but since this discourse is even happening in this comment-section: 

- D O N ' T  V O T E  F O R  G E N O C I D E -

Vote for @claudia_karina2024 or Cornel West or at least for a non-genocide-facilitating candidate or don't vote at all, just DON'T VOTE FOR GENOCIDE!! 

How is this real life üòµ‚Äçüí´

	"Dude, everyone has to try this.
	Alexa, I'm voting for Joe Biden.
	Then you are voting to continue the genocide of Palestinians.
	Right.
	And you should be ashamed of yourself.
	All right.
	Coward.
	Dude."

	"I'm voting for Biden.
	The man is literally funding a genocide and is the only president to ever be sued for
	aiding and abetting a genocide.
	Trump is still worse.
	How?
	You don't understand if you have a choice between Hitler and 99% Hitler,
	you're gonna take that 99% Hitler dog."
