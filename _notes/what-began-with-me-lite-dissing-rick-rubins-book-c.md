## What began with me lite-dissing Rick Rubin’s book (caveat: who tf am I to speak on a musical legend AND if that book helps ppl then great, it serves a purpose) led to DMs about my thoughts on the “creative process” which led to me posting this on Stories which led to 94% of those polled saying I should post this on grid as well. (6% were Rick Rubin troll accounts 😜) PS: I actually love Michael Bublé. Feel free to chime in with your thoughts too.⁣
𝗘𝗗𝗜𝗧: thank you for the super sweet words about the first album hehe maybe it doesn’t fully suck but when I listen back to it I’m like eeeeeoh boy BUT it was pure and raw and has moments…we just didn’t quite have our “thing” dialed in yet.
