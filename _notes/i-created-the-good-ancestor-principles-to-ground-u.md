## I created The Good Ancestor Principles to ground us in the values we hold most dear as we do the important yet challenging work of changing the world. I hope this serves you today.

‚öñÔ∏è THE 1st PRINCIPLE: JUSTICE IS A GENERATIONAL JOURNEY.

Justice is an ongoing journey that extends back and forth through time. Through justice work we recognise our interconnections with past, present, and future humans across the world.

Justice work is both INTRA-GENERATIONAL (for present generations), and INTER-GENERATIONAL (for past and future generations).

Through justice work we are grounded in the honouring of our heritage, and  the active hope of our legacy.

‚úäüèæ THE 2nd PRINCIPLE: LIBERATION IS ‚ÄòFOR ME‚Äô AND ‚ÄòFOR WE‚Äô.

Liberation that only serves ourselves is a manifestation of supremacy thinking and domination culture. Liberation that only serves others is a manifestation of internalised oppression and self-betrayal.

Liberation work is both deeply PERSONAL and for the COLLECTIVE. None of us are free until all of us are free.

Liberation work invites us to practice solidarity, care, love, and justice with ourselves and others.

üå± THE 3rd PRINCIPLE: CHANGE NEEDS DEPTH AND DISTANCE.

Change is both long overdue and an intergenerational journey. We must hold the urgency of change, and the reality of how long it takes to create it.

Change must GO DEEP into the roots of our personal, interpersonal, systemic, and institutional oppression.

Change is a LONG-DISTANCE marathon requiring sustainability, not just a sprint requiring reactability. We must do our best to take care of ourselves and each other as we strive for depth and distance.

üíõ THE 4th PRINCIPLE: LOVE IS THE PATH AND THE POINT.

Love is WHY we do the work of justice and liberation, HOW we do it, and WHERE we are trying to get to.
We do this work for love, through love, and to love.

Love is the opposite of supremacy. It is a ‚Äúcombination of care, commitment, knowledge, responsibility, respect and trust‚Äù (bell hooks).

Love embodies the full spectrum of our humanity, from our joy and our hope, to our grief and rage. Love is a practice, not a performance.
