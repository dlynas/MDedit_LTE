## I know it’s a strange feeling. It can almost feel like we’ve done something wrong — we turn within and all of a sudden we start to see changes in the relationships around us. We grow closer to some, and further from others. 

Emotionally, it’s extremely disorientating when these shifts take place. But I want to remind you that change comes as a result of you being closer to yourself & your truth is divinely guided. 

It’s ok for relationships to change. It’s ok for friendships to grow apart. It’s ok for you to feel called to find new more aligned relationships and doubt if they are even out there.. 

But they are. I promise. The more you align with you — the more life will send you the right people for this stage of your growth.
