### Foundation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Foundation")\]

The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formed in July 1990 by [John Gilmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist) "John Gilmore (activist)"), [John Perry Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow "John Perry Barlow") and [Mitch Kapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor "Mitch Kapor") in response to a series of actions by law enforcement agencies that led them to conclude that the authorities were gravely uninformed about emerging forms of online communication,<sup id="cite_ref-jones2003_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-jones2003-6">[6]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources"><span title="The material near this tag may rely on an unreliable source. only has one citation (May 2024)">unreliable source?</span></a></i>]</sup> and that there was a need for increased protection for [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") [civil liberties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties "Civil liberties").

In April 1990, Barlow had been visited by a U.S. [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "Federal Bureau of Investigation") agent in relation to the theft and distribution of the source code for a series of Macintosh ROMs. Barlow described the visit as "complicated by \[the agent's\] fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology. I realized right away that before I could demonstrate my innocence, I would first have to explain to him what guilt might be." Barlow felt that his experience was symptomatic of a "great paroxysm of governmental confusion during which everyone's liberties would become at risk".<sup id="cite_ref-oY9P7_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-oY9P7-7">[7]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources. (May 2024)">non-primary source needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Barlow posted an account of this experience to [The WELL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL "The WELL") online community and was contacted by Mitch Kapor, who had had a similar experience. The pair agreed that there was a need to defend civil liberties on the Internet. Kapor agreed to fund any legal fees associated with such a defense and the pair contacted New York lawyers Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky and Lieberman about defending several computer hackers from a _Harper's_ magazine forum on computers and freedom who had been the target of [Secret Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service "United States Secret Service") raids.<sup id="cite_ref-jones2003_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-jones2003-6">[6]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources"><span title="The material near this tag may rely on an unreliable source. only has one citation (May 2024)">unreliable source?</span></a></i>]</sup> This generated a large amount of publicity which led to offers of financial support from [John Gilmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist) "John Gilmore (activist)") and [Steve Wozniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak "Steve Wozniak"). Barlow and Kapor continued to research conflicts between the government and technology and in June 1990, Barlow posted online the influential article entitled "Crime & Puzzlement" in which Barlow announced his and Kapor's plans to create an organization to "raise and disburse funds for education, lobbying, and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the Constitution into Cyberspace."<sup id="cite_ref-AoxHb_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-AoxHb-8">[8]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources. (May 2024)">non-primary source needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

This generated further reaction and support for the ideas of Barlow and Kapor. In late June, Barlow held a series of dinners in [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco "San Francisco") with major figures in the computer industry to develop a coherent response to these perceived threats. Barlow considered that: "The actions of the FBI and Secret Service were symptoms of a growing social crisis: Future Shock. America was entering the Information Age with neither laws nor metaphors for the appropriate protection and conveyance of information itself."<sup id="cite_ref-barlow-history_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-barlow-history-9">[9]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources. (May 2024)">non-primary source needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Barlow felt that to confront this a formal organization would be needed; he hired Cathy Cook as press coordinator, and began to set up what would become the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formally founded on July 10, 1990, by Kapor and Barlow, who very soon after elected Gilmore, Wozniak, and [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand "Stewart Brand") to join them on the board of directors.<sup id="cite_ref-barlow-history_9-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-barlow-history-9">[9]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources.

In 1990, [Mike Godwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Godwin "Mike Godwin") joined the organization as its first staff counsel. Then in 1991, [Esther Dyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Dyson "Esther Dyson") and Jerry Berman joined the EFF board of directors. By 1992, Cliff Figallo became the director of the original office, and in December 1992, Jerry Berman became the acting executive director of the organization as a whole, based in a new second office.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Early cases\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Early cases")\]

The creation of the organization was motivated by the massive [search and seizure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_seizure "Search and seizure") on [Steve Jackson Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jackson_Games "Steve Jackson Games") executed by the [United States Secret Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service "United States Secret Service") early in 1990. Similar but officially unconnected law-enforcement raids were being conducted across the United States at about that time as part of a state–federal task force called [Operation Sundevil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sundevil "Operation Sundevil"). _[GURPS Cyberpunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS_Cyberpunk "GURPS Cyberpunk")_, one of the game company's projects, was mistakenly labeled as a handbook for computer crime,<sup id="cite_ref-6forI_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-6forI-12">[12]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources. (May 2024)">non-primary source needed</span></a></i>]</sup> and the Secret Service raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games. The [search warrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant "Search warrant") for the raid was deemed hastily issued, and the games company soon after claimed unauthorized access as well as tampering of their emails. While phone calls were protected by legislation, digital emails were an early concept and had not been considered to fall under the right to personal privacy. The [Steve Jackson Games case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jackson_Games,_Inc._v._United_States_Secret_Service "Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service") was the EFF's first high-profile case, was the major rallying point around which the EFF began promoting computer- and Internet-related civil liberties.<sup id="cite_ref-DTryt_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-DTryt-13">[13]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="This is the court decision itself and does not describe EFF's role. (February 2019)">failed verification</span></a></i>]</sup>

The EFF's second big case was _[Bernstein v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_v._United_States "Bernstein v. United States")_ led by [Cindy Cohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Cohn "Cindy Cohn"), in which programmer and professor [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Bernstein "Daniel J. Bernstein") sued the government for permission to publish his [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption "Encryption") software, Snuffle, and a paper describing it. More recently, the organization has been involved in defending [Edward Felten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Felten "Edward Felten"), [Jon Lech Johansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Lech_Johansen "Jon Lech Johansen") and [Dmitry Sklyarov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Sklyarov "Dmitry Sklyarov").<sup id="cite_ref-btfC4_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-btfC4-14">[14]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources.

### Expansion and development\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Expansion and development")\]

In early 2010, EFF released this poster in celebration of its founding 20 years before.

The organization was originally located at [Mitch Kapor's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor "Mitch Kapor") Kapor Enterprises offices in Boston.<sup id="cite_ref-harris2002_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-harris2002-15">[15]</a></sup> By the fall of 1993, the main EFF offices were consolidated into a single office in Washington DC,<sup id="cite_ref-harris2002_15-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-harris2002-15">[15]</a></sup> headed by Executive Director Jerry Berman. During this time, some of the EFF's attention focused on [influencing national policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying "Lobbying"),<sup id="cite_ref-harris2002_15-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-harris2002-15">[15]</a></sup> to the dislike of some of the members of the organization.<sup id="cite_ref-harris2002_15-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-harris2002-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-timberg2013_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-timberg2013-16">[16]</a></sup> In 1994, Berman parted ways with the EFF and formed the [Center for Democracy and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Democracy_and_Technology "Center for Democracy and Technology"),<sup id="cite_ref-harris2002_15-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-harris2002-15">[15]</a></sup> while Drew Taubman briefly took the reins as executive director.

In 1995, under the auspices of Executive Director [Lori Fena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lori_Fena "Lori Fena"), after some downsizing and in an effort to regroup and refocus on their base of support, the organization moved offices to [San Francisco, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco "San Francisco").<sup id="cite_ref-harris2002_15-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-harris2002-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-timberg2013_16-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-timberg2013-16">[16]</a></sup> There, it took up temporary residence at [John Gilmore's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist) "John Gilmore (activist)") Toad Hall, and soon afterward moved into the Hamm's Building at 1550 Bryant St. After Fena moved onto the EFF board of directors for a while, the organization was led briefly by [Tara Lemmey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tara_Lemmey "Tara Lemmey"), followed by Barry Steinhardt (who had come from the closely allied Technology and Liberty Program at the [American Civil Liberties Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union "American Civil Liberties Union") (ACLU), and eventually returned to the ACLU). Not long before EFF's move into new offices at 454 Shotwell St. in SF's Mission District, Mike Godwin departed, long-time Legal Director [Shari Steele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shari_Steele "Shari Steele") was appointed executive director, and staff attorney [Cindy Cohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Cohn "Cindy Cohn") became the legal director.

In the spring of 2006, the EFF announced the opening of an office again in Washington, D.C., with two new staff attorneys.<sup id="cite_ref-BhQ0u_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-BhQ0u-17">[17]</a></sup> In 2012, the EFF began a fundraising campaign for the renovation of a building located at 815 Eddy Street in San Francisco, to serve as its new headquarters.<sup id="cite_ref-Uinim_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-Uinim-18">[18]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources.

### DES cracker\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: DES cracker")\]

By the mid-1990s the EFF was becoming seriously concerned about the refusal of the US government to license any secure encryption product for export unless it utilized [key recovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_escrow "Key escrow") and claims that governments could not decrypt information when protected by [Data Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard "Data Encryption Standard") (DES), continuing even after the public breaking of the code in the first of the [DES Challenges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DES_Challenges "DES Challenges"). They coordinated and supported the construction of the _EFF DES cracker_ (nicknamed Deep Crack), using special purpose hardware and software and costing $210,000.<sup id="cite_ref-uUtdx_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-uUtdx-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-N2mep_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-N2mep-22">[22]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources. (May 2024)">non-primary source needed</span></a></i>]</sup> This brought the record for breaking a message down to 56 hours on 17 July 1998 and to under 24 hours on 19 January 1999 (in conjunction with [distributed.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed.net "Distributed.net")).

The EFF published the plans and source code for the cracker.<sup id="cite_ref-Fz9Uk_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-Fz9Uk-23">[23]</a></sup> Within four years the [Advanced Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard "Advanced Encryption Standard") was standardized as a replacement for DES.<sup id="cite_ref-KmTcN_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-KmTcN-24">[24]</a></sup>

The EFF regularly brings and defends lawsuits at all levels of the US legal system in pursuit of its goals and objectives. The EFF has long taken a stance against [strategic lawsuits against public participation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation "Strategic lawsuit against public participation") (SLAPP) as attempts to stymie free speech and advocated for effective anti-SLAPP legislation.<sup id="cite_ref-7q3Fa_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-7q3Fa-26">[26]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="The material near this tag failed verification of its source citation(s).

### Patent Busting Project\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Patent Busting Project")\]

The [Patent Busting Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Busting_Project "Patent Busting Project") is an Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) initiative challenging patents that the organization claims are illegitimate and suppress innovation or limit online expression. The initiative launched on April 19, 2004, and involves two phases: documenting the damage caused by these patents, and submitting challenges to the [United States Patent and Trademark Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office "United States Patent and Trademark Office").<sup id="cite_ref-7XihK_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-7XihK-28">[28]</a></sup>

### Enfranchisement activism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Enfranchisement activism")\]

The EFF has long been an advocate of paper audit trails for voting machines and testified in support of them after the [2004 United States presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election "2004 United States presidential election").<sup id="cite_ref-aejGm_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-aejGm-29">[29]</a></sup> Later, it funded the research of Hariprasad Vemuru who exposed vulnerabilities in a particular model.<sup id="cite_ref-tEMFm_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-tEMFm-30">[30]</a></sup> Since 2008, the EFF has operated the _Our Vote Live_ website and database. Staffed by hotline volunteers, it is designed to quickly document irregularities and instances of voter suppression as they occur on an election day.<sup id="cite_ref-OPl39_31-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-OPl39-31">[31]</a></sup>

The EFF was active in the [2016 United States presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election "2016 United States presidential election") because of online [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing "Phishing") related to the controversy over [fabrication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Fabrication "Lie") of election results. [J. Alex Halderman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Alex_Halderman "J. Alex Halderman"), a computer security professor at the [University of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan "University of Michigan"), wrote an article that was published in [_Medium_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website) "Medium (website)") in 2016 stating he thought it was advisable to have a recount on some of the election results from states like [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin "Wisconsin"), [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan "Michigan"), and [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania "Pennsylvania"), exclusively states Hillary Clinton lost.<sup id="cite_ref-k7Q5z_32-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-k7Q5z-32">[32]</a></sup> In retaliation against Halderman, a hacker sent [anti-Semitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism") and [racist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism "Racism") emails to students at University of Michigan signed from Halderman.

### Content moderation reform\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Content moderation reform")\]

In the spring of 2018, the EFF joined the [Open Technology Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Technology_Institute "Open Technology Institute") (OTI), the [Center for Democracy & Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Democracy_%26_Technology "Center for Democracy & Technology"), the [ACLU Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACLU_Foundation "ACLU Foundation") of Northern California and four academics in writing _The Santa Clara Principles: On Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation_. The document sets out the following guidelines for social networks.<sup id="cite_ref-dRqZi_34-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-dRqZi-34">[34]</a></sup>

-   Statistics on removed posts should be publicly available.
-   Banned users or users who have had posts deleted should be notified with clear reasons.
-   Such users should have the opportunity to appeal and have that appeal read by a human.

Six months later, the same organizations sought the support of roughly 80 others, including [Article 19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_19 "Article 19"), in calling for Facebook to adopt the Santa Clara Principles.<sup id="cite_ref-Wo1bp_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-Wo1bp-35">[35]</a></sup> This was later updated with a request for Facebook to warn users who have interacted with sock puppet law enforcement accounts.<sup id="cite_ref-kbpDt_36-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-kbpDt-36">[36]</a></sup>

In 2019, the EFF and OTI delivered testimony about the [Online Harms White Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Harms_White_Paper "Online Harms White Paper") in the United Kingdom. They commented that several proposals to increase the amount of regulation on social media were open to abuse.<sup id="cite_ref-eVa43_37-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-eVa43-37">[37]</a></sup> Also in 2019, the EFF launched the website "[TOSsed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service "Terms of service") out" to document cases of moderation rules being applied inconsistently.<sup id="cite_ref-374iW_38-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-374iW-38">[38]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources"><span title="The material near this tag may rely on an unreliable source.

#### Protect the Stack\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_Frontier_Foundation&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Protect the Stack")\]

In December 2022, the EFF and 56 other digital advocacy organizations called for internet infrastructure providers to stop policing the content of the websites they service.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources. (May 2024)">non-primary source needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The organizations argued that many providers can only moderate content by revoking access to an entire website, leaving end-users with little transparency or recourse. They expressed concern that governments may pressure infrastructure providers to deny service to opponents and marginalized groups, and that monopolistic infrastructure providers may take banned users offline altogether. The coalition believes that platforms and user-facing websites are better-positioned as moderators, because they can remove specific content, sanction accounts granularly, and offer reasoning and appeals for moderation decisions.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources.

The initiative was launched in the wake of [Drop Kiwi Farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DropKiwifarms "DropKiwifarms"), a campaign that convinced several [internet service providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_providers "Internet service providers") and [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "Denial-of-service attack") protection firms to revoke service to [Kiwi Farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_Farms "Kiwi Farms"), a controversial forum.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources.
