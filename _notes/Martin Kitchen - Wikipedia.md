Kitchen received the following reviews for _[Speer: Hitler's Architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speer:_Hitler%27s_Architect "Speer: Hitler's Architect")_, a biography of the Nazi war criminal [Albert Speer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Speer "Albert Speer"). Writing in 2016 [Roger Moorhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Moorhouse "Roger Moorhouse") for _[History Today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_Today "History Today")_ said "Kitchen is brilliant and brutal, exposing every aspect of his subject’s story to stern scrutiny. He begins at the very start, showing that even Speer’s tale of his birth was a lie."<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kitchen#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> The Kirkus Review said "Kitchen sets the record straight on Albert Speer’s assertions of ignorance of the Final Solution and claims to being the good Nazi."<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kitchen#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> [Jonathan Meades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Meades "Jonathan Meades") writing in the _[London Review of Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Review_of_Books "London Review of Books")_ said "Speer: Hitler’s Architect is not a biography. It is a 200,000-word charge sheet. Kitchen is steely, dogged and attentive to the small print. He shows Speer no mercy, nailing his every exculpatory ruse and demonstrating time and again how provisional the notion of truth was to him.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kitchen#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
