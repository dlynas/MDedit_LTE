	Hi Shane. 

	What's your response to Ross Coulthart's assertion that if the DOD, CIA, or other IC sources don't like the story that a journalist is investigating, they'll:

	* Offer them a tidbit of a different better scoop to entice them to drop the story

	* Or threaten to pull all sources from the publication's behind the scenes assistance, unless the story is dropped

	Is this conflict of interest symbiotic relationship really this bad in military/IC journalism coverage?

	I remember reading about the leaks related to War Thunder, where gamers with security clearances wanted to win arguments about the capabilities of tanks and other military hardware. In your reporting you say Texeira's motive appeared to be just ... clout? Any more details about motivation, or the reception by the communities he was trying to impress? It baffles me that someone would risk their freedom just to get some strangers online to think they are cool.

	* 🟨 **[washingtonpost](https://www.reddit.com/user/washingtonpost) (OP)** ⬆️ 30 _(2023-12-14 15:57:37)_

		**From Samuel Oakford:** There have been other leaks of classified intelligence tied to War Thunder forums, but they’ve been relatively limited and specific to military equipment. Things like classified manuals. This was a totally different ball game. Teixeira’s leaking on Thug Shaker Central — as incredible as it was — was in keeping with this role he’d established during the pandemic as a leader on the server. He was keeping them "informed."We learned that Teixeira also leaked on Abinavski’s Exclusion Zone, a server originally formed for fans of a YouTuber who made fun edits of War Thunder videos, but which had since taken on a life of its own. The server wasn't toxic in the way that Thug Shaker Central was and Teixeira didn’t have the same leadership role. But he found a ready audience with certain users who were already fascinated by military hardware and conflict. In fact, one moderator told us that in hindsight his interest in the intel might have played a role in why he didn’t end up reporting Teixeira. But he also was so bewildered by what was going on and expected Teixeira to get caught by authorities… that didn’t happen for over a year!

		I’m unsurprised by this.   We’ve been told this is the “Information Age” for a few decades now.  Used to be that you showed off by driving a corvette.  Now you show off by giving some tidbits of private information to a crowd that is hungry for anything new or interesting.

* 🟩 **[Turtledonuts](https://www.reddit.com/user/Turtledonuts)** ⬆️ 45 _(2023-12-14 17:29:47)_

	A young, impressionable low ranking enlisted airman got away with collecting and disseminating high classified information for months, in one of the worst security breaches of the modern era. It seems like a disproportionate amount of the reporting has gone into explaining discord’s structure and culture instead of the 102nd IW’s operations.“Breaking news, 21 year old enlisted troops are still dumb! Tune back in at 11 for a comparison to other disasters caused by a soldier bragging in public in ancient egypt, the roman republic, mycenian greece, dynaistic china, the mongol empire, biblical judea, persia, gaul, the revolutionary war, the civil war, ww1, ww2, and the cold war! After that, a shocking expose that people can share files on the internet anonymously!” 

	How’s the story of a dumb kid and the existence of social media platforms really more interesting than the career officers of the 102nd Intel wing who let this happen?

	The relevant questions here are the institutional ones. Has the pentagon made plans to meaningfully change how they operate to stop this sort of thing from happening again? 

	 How far up the chain of command does this failure go? Will be repercussions for his commanding officers? How did nobody notice that these documents were being illegally accessed, moved, copied, or even taken? How does the military plan to stop the next Teixeira from reenacting Dr. Strangelove instead of Jack Ryan?

	* 🟨 **[Mysticpoisen](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mysticpoisen)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-12-15 10:06:31)_

* 🟩 **[Menu-False](https://www.reddit.com/user/Menu-False)** ⬆️ 24 _(2023-12-14 15:04:18)_

	How did the Washington Post go about deciding what to report from the leaks and what not to? Were there any doubts about posting any information from a document due to national security concerns?

	* 🟨 **[washingtonpost](https://www.reddit.com/user/washingtonpost) (OP)** ⬆️ 29 _(2023-12-14 15:17:48)_

		**From Shane Harris:** Our team of reporters first examined the documents to determine what was in them, what was most newsworthy, and where we felt we could add from our own reporting to what the documents said. In every case, we discussed the information in the documents with U.S. officials and asked for their comments, as well as any concerns they had about the potential risks to national security from publishing certain information--we do this every time we are dealing with sensitive information, on any story. Ultimately, we, as independent journalists, made the call on what to publish.

* 🟩 **[keenfoot](https://www.reddit.com/user/keenfoot)** ⬆️ 15 _(2023-12-14 15:24:34)_

	Any indication that Teixeira was directly connected to malignant actor countries or groups rather than being a lone actor?

	* 🟨 **[washingtonpost](https://www.reddit.com/user/washingtonpost) (OP)** ⬆️ 25 _(2023-12-14 15:46:58)_

		**From Chris Dehghanpoor:** We know that there were foreign users in the servers where Jack shared classified material, but we didn't uncover anything in the course of our reporting that indicated he was sharing information directly with other countries. That's not to say that definitely wasn't happening, but it's not something we found evidence of. Many of Jack's friends said that he was driven by his desire to keep others in the servers "informed".

Would you have a comment about Gellman's assertion that there is a gentleman's agreement among American publications to minimize reporting on US intelligence issues in favor of self censorship, and undue deference waiting for government agencies to confirm facts? Or have things changed in general/specifically at WaPo (maybe even because of thr Snowden publications) in ten years that the past truth of that assertion no longer holds?

	What is your take on Mr. Teixeira being held in custody while Mr. Trump, a private citizen who was still responsible for the proper handling, storage, and dissemination of Classified documents wven after he has been detached from the government walks free?

	I know Mr. Teixeira tried to use the fact that Mr. Trump walks free as an argument to get bail.

		**From Samuel Oakford:** A big surprise came towards the end of our reporting, when we got the chance to sit down with Discord executives in San Francisco. The company confirmed that Teixeira deleted Thug Shaker Central on April 7. They told us that because the server had never been flagged to them, all its content was gone the minute he did that. Classified material still made it off Discord in the form of screenshots etc. — that’s how the press caught wind of it — but it was significant that the original record of Teixeira’s activity on this server appeared to be gone, and because of that, it was inaccessible to law enforcement.

		* 🟧 **[eekamuse](https://www.reddit.com/user/eekamuse)** ⬆️ 13 _(2023-12-14 21:53:22)_

		* 🟧 **[SoleRainbow](https://www.reddit.com/user/SoleRainbow)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-24 04:50:21)_

* 🟩 **[aubrt](https://www.reddit.com/user/aubrt)** ⬆️ 9 _(2023-12-14 16:32:08)_

	How do you understand the shift (post-9/11 in general, and especially from Wikileaks forward) of mainstream news organizations toward *attacking* leakers and whistleblowers instead of celebrating them or even just focusing on straight reporting of the leaked information? Do you worry that you personally, and the institutions you work for generally, have become so focused on maintaining cozy relations with the security state that you may be incapable even of recognizing, much less fostering, information flows that would allow for functionally democratic opinion-formation?

	* 🟨 **[washingtonpost](https://www.reddit.com/user/washingtonpost) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-17 13:33:38)_

		**From Shane Harris:** We don't "attack" leakers and whistleblowers. They are a vital source of information that is often in the public interest. And when they are our sources, we protect them. We wrote dozens of articles about the information Teixeira is alleged to have shared. I don't worry that the press has become "cozy" with intelligence agencies, and I doubt they think we have. It's an adversarial relationship. It is professional and respectful. But we work for the public, not the government.
		
		I think it's also important to distinguish something unusual about this case. Teixeira is not a whistleblower. According to people who knew him, he never intended for the information he shared to be widely distributed or to make its way to journalists. Our reporting has led to stories about why he shared that information, and the security lapses that enabled it. The press has written similar stories about actual whistleblowers--including Snowden, Manning, and Winner--at the same time that we have reported on the information they disclosed.

* 🟩 **[InGenNateKenny](https://www.reddit.com/user/InGenNateKenny)** ⬆️ 6 _(2023-12-14 15:36:19)_

	What do you think will be the greatest long-term implication of these leaks? Just on security classification or anything specifically relating to their content (i.e. Ukraine war details having an impact there).

	* 🟨 **[washingtonpost](https://www.reddit.com/user/washingtonpost) (OP)** ⬆️ 29 _(2023-12-14 15:49:22)_

		**From Shane Harris:** I think the long-term implications are going to be on security clearance and information policy. The leaks, while revealing, didn't do long-term damage as far as we know to intelligence sources and methods. But the leaks revealed serious flaws with how classified information was handled at the facility where Teixeira worked. I wouldn't assume those are isolated problems. The Air Force inspector general wrote about personnel conflating having a clearance with the "need to know" intelligence. In other words, there's a concern that personnel erroneously think a clearance is some kind of all-access pass to intelligence. It's not. If this misconception is more widespread, the military and potentially the intelligence community have a big problem on their hands.

		* 🟧 **[sassynapoleon](https://www.reddit.com/user/sassynapoleon)** ⬆️ 14 _(2023-12-14 18:30:31)_

			The need to compartmentalize to limit the damage of unauthorized disclosures is in direct opposition to the need to have free flow of information within the intelligence community. A key finding of the 9/11 commission was that details of the plot were known to varying degrees, but not available in full due to organizational barriers. This pendulum seems to swing back and forth depending on the latest failure.

			* 🟦 **[Borg-Man](https://www.reddit.com/user/Borg-Man)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-12-15 07:07:51)_

				That was more due to "The Wall": not sharing of information between CIA and FBI, and sometimes even actively working against each other because "it was THEIR investigation".

		* 🟧 **[1zzie](https://www.reddit.com/user/1zzie)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-15 03:43:13)_
