## ive been finding more delicious words, stories and sermons. hearing this felt similar to reading “Uses of the Erotic” by Audre Lorde. I find myself to be a mix of both bodies of work. divine passion. I think my great grandmother taught me how to love. none of her blood in my veins but no one could convince me this ain’t her heart in my chest. 

im so grateful to Maya, too. she got me into poetry it’s why all my first poems rhymed until my poetry coach told me it meant I was a lesser writer. I miss writing which is to say I crave more romance in my life. more of this agape kinship type of romance. 

I like to believe I embody it. the best I can at least. anyway. it’s surely a journey to find your people. but when you do find another’s house that shakes your ideas of home it feels so indescribably good. 

im trying to do better at feeling good and demanding goodness for myself. from this world. I thought that meant saying yes more and agreeing but it hasn’t. goodness has come from goodbyes, nos, blocked accounts and harsh commitments. goodness has been born from darkness, from disgust and anguish. rage, tho foreign to me, has been kinder and more liberating than alll the multi-syllabic words I learned from the dictionary. 

lluvia was agape romance embodied. i miss him. this grief has made the manifesting of romance, lust, care and love even more urgent. 
thanks for reading my ramble. 

send me good juju as I apply for this ED job im excited about. please.

"I'm going to talk about romance.
A community without romance risks being brutish and crass and superficial and brittle and cruel and even murderous without romance.
I don't mean just romantic romance. I don't mean just erotic romance. I mean, I can't pay romance.
I mean, brotherly, sisterly romance. I mean, the romance that allows us to suck on our voices when we see each other.
Hey honey, how you doing? Come here hug my neck. I mean that. I mean having enough romance to say come, let them breathe.
I will not deny my humanity with you. I don't care who's watching. That's romantic. That's it."
