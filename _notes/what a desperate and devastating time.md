## * what a desperate and devastating time

â€”

beloveds - what a desperate and devastating time. there is a media blackout in effect, i keep talking to people who know nothing of our protests, who havenâ€™t heard of aaron bushnellâ€™s self-immolation today. we have to be the volume and light on the work - be uncomfortable, make others uncomfortable, ask everyone, did you hear? about the millions in the streets? did you hear? about the soldier who lit himself on fire in front of the IsrðŸ’”li Embassy this morning? screaming Free PalðŸ’”stine? did you hear about the actions at AIPAC? on Bidenâ€™s campaign trail? the bridges we have shut down? do you know why we are doing all of this? do you know why you arenâ€™t hearing about it? do you know why we wonâ€™t stop? let me tell you why. let me show you my heart and tell you why. slide 3 may be misinformation, waiting for more clarity
