## Fixating on Palestinians as imperfect victims is the absolution of, and complicity with, Israel’s colonial domination…The 40,000 Palestinians who, weekly, participated in the Great March of Return in 2018 demanding their right to return to the homeland they were expelled from and the end of the siege, only to be shot down like birds by Israeli snipers.

MSM  have steadily shrunk space for Palestinian voices. Accepted and declined op-eds, canceled appearances, etc all in the service of the escalating beat of war drums. I published this yesterday in a continuing attempt to cut through the noise.
