[Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx")'s three volume _[Capital: A Critique of Political Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital "Das Kapital")_ is widely regarded as one of the greatest written critiques of capitalism.

**Criticism of capitalism** is a critique of [political economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy "Political economy") that involves the rejection of, or dissatisfaction with the economic system of [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") and its outcomes. Criticisms typically range from expressing disagreement with particular aspects or outcomes of capitalism to rejecting the principles of the capitalist system in its entirety.<sup id="cite_ref-nymag_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-nymag-1">[1]</a></sup>

Criticism of capitalism comes from various political and philosophical approaches, including [anarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism"), [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism"), [Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist "Marxist"), [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religions "Religions"), and [nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism "Nationalism") viewpoints. Some believe that capitalism can only be overcome through [revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution "Revolution") while others believe that structural change can come slowly through [political reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism "Reformism"). Some critics believe there are merits in capitalism and wish to balance it with some form of social control, typically through government regulation (e.g. the [social market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market "Social market") movement).

Prominent among critiques of capitalism are accusations that capitalism is inherently [exploitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour "Exploitation of labour"), [alienating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation "Marx's theory of alienation"), unstable, unsustainable, and creates massive [economic inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality "Economic inequality"), [commodifies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_fetishism "Commodity fetishism") people, and is [anti-democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy "Plutocracy") and leads to an erosion of [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") and [national sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sovereignty "National sovereignty") while it incentivises [imperialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialist "Imperialist") expansion and [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex "Military–industrial complex"), and that it benefits a small minority at the expense of the majority of the population.

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

Early critics of capitalism, such as [Frederick Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels"), claim that [rapid industrialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") in Europe created working conditions viewed as unfair, including [14-hour work days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-hour_day "8-hour day"), [child labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labor "Child labor") and [shanty towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanty_towns "Shanty towns").<sup id="cite_ref-conditionsworking_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-conditionsworking-2">[2]</a></sup> Some modern economists argue that average living standards did not improve, or only very slowly improved, before 1840.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

## Criticism by different schools of thought\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Criticism by different schools of thought")\]

### Anarchism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Anarchism")\]

French anarchist [Pierre-Joseph Proudhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon "Pierre-Joseph Proudhon") opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of [coercion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion "Coercion") that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. The Spanish individualist anarchist [Miguel Giménez Igualada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Gim%C3%A9nez_Igualada "Miguel Giménez Igualada") sees "capitalism is an effect of government; the disappearance of government means capitalism falls from its pedestal vertiginously ... That which we call capitalism is not something else but a product of the State, within which the only thing that is being pushed forward is profit, good or badly acquired. And so to fight against capitalism is a pointless task, since be it [State capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism "State capitalism") or Enterprise capitalism, as long as Government exists, exploiting capital will exist. The fight, but of consciousness, is against the State".<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

Within anarchism, there emerged a critique of [wage slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery "Wage slavery") which refers to a situation perceived as quasi-[voluntary slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_slavery "Voluntary slavery"),<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> where a person's [livelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livelihood "Livelihood") depends on [wages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage "Wage"), especially when the dependence is total and immediate.<sup id="cite_ref-merriam-webster.com_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-merriam-webster.com-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> It is a [negatively connoted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connotation "Connotation") term used to draw an analogy between [slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery "Slavery") and [wage labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labor "Wage labor") by focusing on similarities between owning and [renting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment "Employment") a person. The term "wage slavery" has been used to criticize [economic exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_exploitation "Economic exploitation") and [social stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification "Social stratification"), with the former seen primarily as unequal bargaining power between labor and capital (particularly when workers are paid comparatively low wages, e.g. in [sweatshops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweatshops "Sweatshops"))<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> and the latter as a lack of [workers' self-management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_self-management "Workers' self-management"), fulfilling job choices and leisure in an economy.<sup id="cite_ref-globetrotter.berkeley.edu_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-globetrotter.berkeley.edu-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-spunk.org_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-spunk.org-9">[9]</a></sup>

Libertarian socialists believe if freedom is valued, then society must work towards a system in which individuals have the power to decide economic issues along with political issues. Libertarian socialists seek to replace unjustified authority with [direct democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy "Direct democracy"), voluntary federation and popular autonomy in all aspects of life,<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> including physical communities and economic enterprises. With the advent of the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution"), thinkers such as Proudhon and Marx elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use,<sup id="cite_ref-reformrevolution_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-reformrevolution-11">[11]</a></sup> [Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite "Luddite") emphasized the [dehumanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization "Dehumanization") brought about by machines while later [Emma Goldman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman "Emma Goldman") famously denounced wage slavery by saying: "The only difference is that you are hired slaves instead of block slaves".<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> American anarchist Emma Goldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. "The only demand that property recognizes", she wrote in _Anarchism and Other Essays_, "is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade".<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, "turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron".<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

[Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky") contends that there is little moral difference between chattel slavery and renting one's self to an owner or "wage slavery". He feels that it is an attack on personal integrity that undermines individual freedom. He holds that workers should own and control their workplace.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Many libertarian socialists argue that large-scale voluntary associations should manage industrial manufacture while workers retain rights to the individual products of their labor.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> As such, they see a distinction between the concepts of "private property" and "[personal possession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property "Personal property")". Whereas "private property" grants an individual exclusive control over a thing whether it is in use or not and regardless of its productive capacity, "possession" grants no rights to things that are not in use.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

In addition to anarchist [Benjamin Tucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Tucker "Benjamin Tucker")'s "big four" monopolies (land, money, tariffs and patents) that have emerged under capitalism, neo-[mutualist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory) "Mutualism (economic theory)") economist [Kevin Carson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Carson "Kevin Carson") argues that the [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state") has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. He believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker's focus on individual market transactions, whereas Carson also focuses on organizational issues. The theoretical sections of _[Studies in Mutualist Political Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_in_Mutualist_Political_Economy "Studies in Mutualist Political Economy")_ are presented as an attempt to integrate [marginalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalist "Marginalist") critiques into the [labor theory of value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value "Labor theory of value").<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Carson has also been highly critical of [intellectual property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property "Intellectual property").<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> The primary focus of his most recent work has been decentralized manufacturing and the informal and household economies.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Carson holds that "\[c\]apitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"), was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier [feudal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism "Feudalism") conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable".<sup id="cite_ref-Richman_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-Richman-21">[21]</a></sup>

Carson coined the [pejorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative "Pejorative") term "vulgar libertarianism", a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of [corporate capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_capitalism "Corporate capitalism") and [economic inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality "Economic inequality"). According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase "vulgar political economy", which Karl Marx described as an economic order that "deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions \[existing in economic life\]".<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

### Conservatism and traditionalism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Conservatism and traditionalism")\]

In _Conservatives Against Capitalism_, Peter Kolozi relies on [Norberto Bobbio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norberto_Bobbio "Norberto Bobbio")'s definition of right and left, dividing the two camps according to their preference for equality or hierarchy. Kolozi argued that capitalism has faced persistent criticism from the right since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Such critics, while heterogeneous, are united in the belief “that laissez-faire capitalism has undermined an established social hierarchy governed by the virtuous or excellent".<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

In September 2018, Murtaza Hussain wrote in _[The Intercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intercept "The Intercept")_ about "Conservatives Against Capitalism", stating:

> For all their differences, there is one key aspect of the intellectual history charted in "Conservatives Against Capitalism" that deals with an issue of shared concern on both the left and the right: the need for community. One of the grim consequences of the Social Darwinian pressures unleashed by free-market capitalism has been the destruction of networks of community, family, and professional associations in developed societies. ... These so-called intermediate institutions have historically played a vital role giving ordinary people a sense of meaning and protecting them from the [structural violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_violence "Structural violence") of the state and the market. Their loss has led to the creation of a huge class of atomized and lonely people, cut adrift from traditional sources of support and left alone to contend with the power of impersonal economic forces.<sup id="cite_ref-Hussain_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-Hussain-24">[24]</a></sup>

In June 2023, Bridget Ryder wrote in _[The European Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_European_Conservative "The European Conservative")_ about the [degrowth movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth "Degrowth"), stating:<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

> The capitalist-critical conservative, however, sees possibilities for technological progress and personal freedoms that lie beyond market-driven economics, finding inspiration in European traditions that have been supplanted by industrialisation. Despite the gains in efficiency made within capitalism, many conservatives remain sceptical of the possibility of endless economic growth, particularly given that God is infinite and his creatures, including petroleum and other minerals, are not.

### Fascism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Fascism")\]

Fascists opposed both [international socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_socialism "International socialism") and [free-market capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_capitalism "Free-market capitalism"), arguing that their views represented a [Third Position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Position "Third Position")<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> and claiming to provide a realistic economic alternative that was neither _[laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire "Laissez-faire")_ [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism") nor [communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism "Communism"). <sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> They favored [corporatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism "Corporatism") and [class collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_collaboration "Class collaboration"), believing that the existence of inequality and social hierarchy was beneficial (contrary to the views of [socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialists "Socialists"))<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> while also arguing that the state had a role in mediating relations between classes (contrary to the views of [economic liberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_liberals "Economic liberals")).<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

### Liberalism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Liberalism")\]

During the [Age of Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment"), some proponents of liberalism were critics of [wage slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery "Wage slavery").<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

### Marxism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Marxism")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Pyramid_of_Capitalist_System.jpg/220px-Pyramid_of_Capitalist_System.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pyramid_of_Capitalist_System.jpg)

The "[Pyramid of Capitalist System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Capitalist_System "Pyramid of Capitalist System")" cartoon made by the [Industrial Workers of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World "Industrial Workers of the World") (1911) is an example of a socialist critique of capitalism and of [social stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification "Social stratification").

[Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx") considered capitalism to be a historically specific [mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production "Mode of production") (the way in which the productive property is owned and controlled, combined with the corresponding [social relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relations_of_production "Social relations of production") between individuals based on their connection with the process of production).<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The "capitalistic era" according to Marx dates from 16th-century merchants and small urban workshops.<sup id="cite_ref-GSGB_33-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-GSGB-33">[33]</a></sup> Marx knew that wage labour existed on a modest scale for centuries before capitalist industry. For Marx, the capitalist stage of development or "[bourgeois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeois "Bourgeois") society" represented the most advanced form of social organization to date, but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") or [communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism "Communism") transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic, then capitalist and finally working class rule was reached.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

Following [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith"), Marx distinguished the [use value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_value "Use value") of commodities from their [exchange value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_value "Exchange value") in the market. According to Marx, capital is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases. For Marx, the use of [labor power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_power "Labor power") had itself become a commodity under capitalism and the exchange value of labor power, as reflected in the wage, is less than the value it produces for the capitalist.

This difference in values, he argues, constitutes [surplus value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value "Surplus value"), which the capitalists extract and accumulate. In his book _[Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital "Das Kapital")_, Marx argues that the [capitalist mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory) "Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)") is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers—all prior class societies had extracted [surplus labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_labor "Surplus labor"), but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale-value of produced commodities.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> He argues that a core requirement of a capitalist society is that a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-sustenance that would allow them to be independent and are instead forced to sell their labor for a wage.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>

In conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was Marx's belief that the working class, due to its relationship to the means of production and numerical superiority under capitalism, would be the driving force behind the socialist revolution.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

In _[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism,_the_Highest_Stage_of_Capitalism "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism")_ (1916), [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") further developed Marxist theory and argued that capitalism necessarily led to [monopoly capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_capitalism "Monopoly capitalism") and the export of capital—which he also called "imperialism"—to find new markets and resources, representing the last and highest stage of capitalism.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> Some 20th-century [Marxian economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxian_economics "Marxian economics") consider capitalism to be a social formation where capitalist class processes dominate, but are not exclusive.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

To these thinkers, capitalist class processes are simply those in which surplus labor takes the form of surplus value, usable as capital; other tendencies for utilization of labor nonetheless exist simultaneously in existing societies where capitalist processes predominate. However, other late Marxian thinkers argue that a social formation as a whole may be classed as capitalist if capitalism is the mode by which a surplus is extracted, even if this surplus is not produced by capitalist activity as when an absolute majority of the population is engaged in non-capitalist economic activity.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>

In _Limits to Capital_ (1982), [David Harvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey "David Harvey") outlines an overdetermined, "spatially restless" capitalism coupled with the spatiality of crisis formation and resolution.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> Harvey used Marx's theory of crisis to aid his argument that capitalism must have its "fixes", but that we cannot predetermine what fixes will be implemented, nor in what form they will be. His work on contractions of capital accumulation and international movements of capitalist modes of production and money flows has been influential.<sup id="cite_ref-Lawson,_Victoria_2007_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-Lawson,_Victoria_2007-45">[45]</a></sup> According to Harvey, capitalism creates the conditions for volatile and geographically uneven development.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>

Sociologists such as Ulrich Beck envisioned the society of risk as a new cultural value which saw risk as a commodity to be exchanged in globalized economies. This theory suggested that disasters and capitalist economy were inevitably entwined. Disasters allow the introduction of economic programs which otherwise would be rejected as well as decentralizing the class structure in production.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

### Religion\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Religion")\]

Many [organized religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_religion "Organized religion") have criticized or opposed specific elements of capitalism.

### \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Socialism")\]

[Socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through [externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externalities "Externalities") that require costly corrective regulatory measures. They also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products to be sold at a profit (such as high-pressure advertisement), thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup>

Socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity, such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates (known as [speculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation "Speculation")), rather than for consumption. Therefore, a crucial criticism often made by socialists is that making money, or accumulation of capital, does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand (the production of [use-values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use-value "Use-value")).<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> The fundamental criterion for economic activity in capitalism is the accumulation of capital for reinvestment in production. This spurs the development of new, non-productive industries that do not produce use-value and only exist to keep the accumulation process afloat. An example of a non-productive industry is the [financial industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financialization "Financialization"), which contributes to the formation of economic bubbles.<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>

Socialists view [private property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property "Private property") relations as limiting the potential of [productive forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productive_forces "Productive forces") in the economy. According to socialists, private property becomes obsolete when it concentrates into centralized, socialized institutions based on private appropriation of revenue (but based on cooperative work and internal planning in allocation of inputs) until the role of the capitalist becomes redundant.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> With no need for [capital accumulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_accumulation "Capital accumulation") and a class of owners, private property of the means of production is perceived as being an outdated form of economic organization that should be replaced by a [free association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_(communism_and_anarchism) "Free association (communism and anarchism)") of individuals based on public or [common ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ownership "Common ownership") of these socialized assets.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Engels_Selected_Works_1968,_p._40_68-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-Engels_Selected_Works_1968,_p._40-68">[68]</a></sup> Private ownership imposes constraints on planning, leading to uncoordinated economic decisions that result in business fluctuations, unemployment and a tremendous waste of material resources during crisis of [overproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overproduction "Overproduction").

Excessive disparities in income distribution lead to social instability and require costly corrective measures in the form of redistributive taxation. This incurs heavy administrative costs while weakening the incentive to work, inviting dishonesty and increasing the likelihood of tax evasion (the corrective measures) while reducing the overall efficiency of the market economy. These corrective policies limit the market's incentive system by providing things such as [minimum wages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage "Minimum wage"), [unemployment insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefit "Unemployment benefit"), taxing profits and reducing the reserve army of labor, resulting in reduced incentives for capitalists to invest in more production. In essence, social welfare policies cripple capitalism's incentive system and are thus unsustainable in the long-run.

[Marxists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxists "Marxists") argue that the establishment of a [socialist mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_(Marxism) "Socialism (Marxism)") is the only way to overcome these deficiencies. Socialists and specifically Marxian socialists, argue that the inherent conflict of interests between the working class and capital prevent optimal use of available human resources and leads to contradictory interest groups (labor and business) striving to influence the state to intervene in the economy at the expense of overall economic efficiency.

Early socialists ([utopian socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian_socialism "Utopian socialism") and [Ricardian socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_socialism "Ricardian socialism")) criticized capitalism for concentrating [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(philosophy) "Power (philosophy)") and [wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth "Wealth") within a small segment of society<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> who do not utilize available [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") and resources to their maximum potential in the interests of the public.<sup id="cite_ref-Engels_Selected_Works_1968,_p._40_68-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-Engels_Selected_Works_1968,_p._40-68">[68]</a></sup>

In the May 1949 issue of the _[Monthly Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monthly_Review "Monthly Review")_ titled "[Why Socialism?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Socialism%3F "Why Socialism?")", [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") wrote:<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup>

> I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate (the) grave evils (of capitalism), namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.

## Topics of criticism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Topics of criticism")\]

### Democracy and freedom\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Democracy and freedom")\]

Economist [Branko Horvat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branko_Horvat "Branko Horvat") stated that "\[I\]t is now well known that capitalist development leads to the concentration of capital, employment and power. It is somewhat less known that it leads to the almost complete destruction of economic freedom".<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>

Critics argue that capitalism is in fact not a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy "Democracy"), but a [plutocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy "Plutocracy"), because in capitalism there is a lack of [political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics "Politics"), [democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy "Democracy") and [economic power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_power "Economic power") for the [vast majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_99%25 "The 99%") of the population. They say that this is because in capitalism the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production") are owned [privately](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property "Private property") by a minority of the population, with the vast majority of the population having no control of the [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy "Economy"). Critics argue that capitalism creates large concentrations of money and property in the hands of [a relatively small minority of the global human population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite "Elite"), leading to vast wealth and income inequalities between the elite and the majority of the population.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> Evidence for the fact that capitalism is [plutocratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy "Plutocracy") can be seen in policies that benefit capitalists at the expense of workers, such as policies where taxes are raised on workers and reduced for capitalists, and the retirement age being increased despite it being against the will of the people. "[Corporate capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_capitalism "Corporate capitalism")" and "[inverted totalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism "Inverted totalitarianism")" are terms used by the aforementioned activists and critics of capitalism to describe a capitalist marketplace—and society—characterized by the dominance of [hierarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical "Hierarchical"), [bureaucratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucratic "Bureaucratic"), [large corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_business "Big business"), which are legally required to pursue profit without concern for social welfare. Corporate capitalism has been criticized for the amount of power and influence corporations and large business interest groups have over government policy, including the policies of regulatory agencies and influencing political campaigns. Many social scientists have criticized [corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation "Corporation") for failing to act in the interests of the people; they claim the existence of large corporations seems to circumvent the principles of democracy, which assumes equal power relations between all individuals in a society.<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> As part of the [political left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_left "Political left"), activists against corporate power and influence work towards a decreased [income gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_gap "Income gap") and improved [economical equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(economics) "Equity (economics)").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

The rise of giant [multinational corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation "Multinational corporation") has been a topic of concern among the aforementioned scholars, intellectuals and activists, who see the large corporation as leading to deep, structural erosion of such basic [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") and [civil rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights "Civil rights") as [equitable wealth and income distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_inequality "Wealth inequality"), equitable democratic political and socio-economic [power representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Elite "The Power Elite") and many other human rights and needs. They have pointed out that in their view large corporations create false needs in consumers and—they contend—have had a long history of interference in and distortion of the policies of [sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty "Sovereignty") [nation states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_states "Nation states") through high-priced legal [lobbying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States "Lobbying in the United States") and other [almost always legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Abramoff "Jack Abramoff"), powerful forms of [influence peddling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_G._Kaiser "Robert G. Kaiser"). In their view, evidence supporting this belief includes invasive advertising (such as [billboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboards "Billboards"), television ads, [adware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adware "Adware"), [spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic) "Spam (electronic)"), [telemarketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemarketing "Telemarketing"), child-targeted advertising and [guerrilla marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_marketing "Guerrilla marketing")), massive open or secret corporate political campaign [contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance "Campaign finance") in so-called "democratic" elections, [corporatocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatocracy "Corporatocracy"), the [revolving door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States "Lobbying in the United States") between government and corporations, [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture "Regulatory capture"), "[too big to fail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail "Too big to fail")" (also known as "[too big to jail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griftopia "Griftopia")"), massive taxpayer-provided corporate [bailouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout "Bailout"), [socialism/communism for the very rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_welfare "Corporate welfare") and brutal, vicious, [Darwinian capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism "Social Darwinism") for everyone else, and—they claim—seemingly endless global news stories about [corporate corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_corruption "Corporate corruption") ([Martha Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart "Martha Stewart") and [Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron "Enron"), among other examples).<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="which?

According to [Quinn Slobodian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Slobodian "Quinn Slobodian"), one way capitalism undermines democracy is by "punching holes in the territory of the nation state" to create [special economic zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_economic_zones "Special economic zones"), of which there are 5,400 around the globe, ranging from [tax havens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_havens "Tax havens") to "sites for low-wage production . . . often ringed by barbed wire," that he describes as "zones of exception with different laws and often no democratic oversight."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESlobodian20231–3_81-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-FOOTNOTESlobodian20231%E2%80%933-81">[81]</a></sup>

The labor theory of value was supported by classical economists like [David Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo "David Ricardo") and [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith") who believed that "the value of a commodity depends on the relative quantity of labor which is necessary for its production".<sup id="cite_ref-principlesvalue_90-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-principlesvalue-90">[90]</a></sup>

> "In capitalism, workers are separated from the means of production, implying that they must compete in labour markets to sell their labour power to capitalists in order to earn a living."

In _[Das Kapital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital "Das Kapital")_, Marx identified the commodity as the basic unit of capitalist organization. Marx described a "common denominator" between commodities, in particular that commodities are the product of labor and are related to each other by an [exchange value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_value "Exchange value") (i.e. [price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price "Price")).<sup id="cite_ref-commodities_92-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-commodities-92">[92]</a></sup> By using the labor theory of value, [Marxists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism") see a connection between labor and exchange value, in that commodities are exchanged depending on the [socially necessary labor time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socially_necessary_labor_time "Socially necessary labor time") needed to produce them.<sup id="cite_ref-valueprice_93-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-valueprice-93">[93]</a></sup> However, due to the productive forces of industrial organization, laborers are seen as creating more exchange value during the course of the working day than the cost of their survival (food, shelter, clothing and so on).<sup id="cite_ref-wagelabour_94-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-wagelabour-94">[94]</a></sup> Marxists argue that capitalists are thus able to pay for this cost of survival while expropriating the excess labor (i.e. [surplus value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value "Surplus value")).<sup id="cite_ref-valueprice_93-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-valueprice-93">[93]</a></sup>

Marxists further argue that due to [economic inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality "Economic inequality"), the purchase of labor cannot occur under "free" conditions. Since capitalists control the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production") (e.g. factories, businesses, machinery and so on) and workers control only their labor, the worker is naturally coerced into allowing their labor to be exploited.<sup id="cite_ref-competition_95-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-competition-95">[95]</a></sup> Critics argue that exploitation occurs even if the exploited consents, since the definition of exploitation is independent of consent. In essence, workers must allow their labor to be exploited or face starvation. Since some degree of unemployment is typical in modern economies, Marxists argue that wages are naturally driven down in free market systems. Hence, even if a worker contests their wages, capitalists are able to find someone from the [reserve army of labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_army_of_labor "Reserve army of labor") who is more desperate.<sup id="cite_ref-histmaterial_96-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-histmaterial-96">[96]</a></sup>

The act (or threat) of [striking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action "Strike action") has historically been an organized action to withhold labor from capitalists, without fear of individual retaliation.<sup id="cite_ref-tradesoc_97-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-tradesoc-97">[97]</a></sup> Some critics of capitalism, while acknowledging the necessity of [trade unionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union "Trade union"), believe that trade unions simply reform an already exploitative system, leaving the system of exploitation intact.<sup id="cite_ref-subterranean_98-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-subterranean-98">[98]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-reformrevolution_11-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-reformrevolution-11">[11]</a></sup> [Lysander Spooner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner "Lysander Spooner") argued that "almost all fortunes are made out of the capital and labour of other men than those who realize them.

Political economist Clara E. Mattei of the [New School for Social Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_School_for_Social_Research "New School for Social Research") demonstrates that the imposition of fiscal, monetary and industrial [austerity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity "Austerity") policies meant to discipline labor by reinforcing hierarchal wage relations and therefore protect the capitalist system through wage repression and the weakening of collective bargaining power by workers can increase their exploitation while boosting the profits of the ownership class, which she says is one of the primary drivers of the "global inequality trend". As an example, Mattei shows that over the last four decades in the United States the profit share of national output increased while labor's share plummeted, demonstrating a symmetrical relationship between owner profit and worker loss, where the former was taking from the latter. She adds that “an increase in exploitation was also evident, with real wages grossly lagging behind labor productivity.”<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMattei202216–19_108-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMattei202216%E2%80%9319-108">[108]</a></sup>

### Imperialism, political oppression, and genocide\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Imperialism, political oppression, and genocide")\]

Near the start of the 20th century, [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") wrote that state use of military power to defend capitalist interests abroad was an inevitable corollary of monopoly capitalism.<sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-marxists_110-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-marxists-110">[110]</a></sup> He argued that capitalism needs imperialism to survive.<sup id="cite_ref-111"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup> According to Lenin, the export of financial capital superseded the export of commodities; banking and industrial capital merged to form large financial cartels and trusts in which production and distribution are highly centralized; and [monopoly capitalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_capitalism "Monopoly capitalism") influenced state policy to carve up the world into spheres of interest. These trends led states to defend their capitalist interests abroad through military power.

According to economic anthropologist [Jason Hickel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Hickel "Jason Hickel"), capitalism requires the accumulation of excess wealth in the hands of economic elites for the purpose of large scale investment, continuous growth and expansion, and enormous amounts of cheap labor. As such, there was never and could never have been a gradual or peaceful transition to capitalism, and that "organized violence, mass impoverishment, and the destruction of self-sufficient subsistence economies" ushered in the capitalist era. Its emergence was fueled by [immiseration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immiseration_thesis "Immiseration thesis") and extreme violence that accompanied [enclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure "Enclosure") and [colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization "Colonization"), with colonized peoples becoming enslaved workers producing products that were then processed by European peasants, dispossessed by enclosure, who filled the factories in desperation as exploited cheap labor. Hickel adds that there was fierce resistance to these developments, as that the period 1500 to the 1800s, "right into the Industrial Revolution, was among the bloodiest, most tumultuous times in world history."<sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup>

Sociologist [David Nibert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nibert "David Nibert") argues that while capitalism "turned out to be every bit as violent and oppressive as the social systems dominated by the old aristocrats", it also included "an additional and pernicious peril—the necessity for continuous growth and expansion". As an example of this, Nibert points to the mass killing of millions of buffalo on the [Great Plains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains "Great Plains") and the subjugation and expulsion of the indigenous population by the U.S. military in the 19th century for the purpose of expanding ranching operations, and rearing livestock for the purpose of profit.<sup id="cite_ref-114"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-114">[114]</a></sup>

Some opponents criticize capitalism's [inefficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inefficiency "Inefficiency"). They note a shift from pre-industrial [reuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuse "Reuse") and thriftiness before capitalism to a consumer-based economy that pushes "ready-made" materials.<sup id="cite_ref-isrwaste_126-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-isrwaste-126">[126]</a></sup> It is argued that a [sanitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation "Sanitation") industry arose under capitalism that deemed trash valueless—a significant break from the past when much "waste" was used and reused almost indefinitely.<sup id="cite_ref-isrwaste_126-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-isrwaste-126">[126]</a></sup> In the process, critics say, capitalism has created a profit driven system based on selling as many products as possible.<sup id="cite_ref-natural_127-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-natural-127">[127]</a></sup> Critics relate the "ready-made" trend to a growing garbage problem in which, as of 2008, 4.5 pounds of trash are generated per person each day (compared to 2.7 pounds in 1960).<sup id="cite_ref-epawaste_128-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-epawaste-128">[128]</a></sup> [Anti-capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalist "Anti-capitalist") groups with an emphasis on [conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement "Conservation movement") include [eco-socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-socialists "Eco-socialists") and [social ecologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_ecology_(theory) "Social ecology (theory)").

[Planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence "Planned obsolescence") has been criticized as a wasteful practice under capitalism. By designing products to wear out faster than need be, new consumption is generated.<sup id="cite_ref-isrwaste_126-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-isrwaste-126">[126]</a></sup> This would benefit corporations by increasing sales while at the same time generating excessive waste.

Some economists, most notably [Marxian economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxian_economists "Marxian economists"), argue that the system of perpetual capital accumulation leads to irrational outcomes and a mis-allocation of resources as industries and jobs are created for the sake of making money as opposed to satisfying actual demands and needs.<sup id="cite_ref-132"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup>

In the United States, the shares of earnings and wealth of the households in the top 1 percent of the corresponding distributions are 21 percent (in 2006) and 37 percent (in 2009), respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-146"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-146">[146]</a></sup> Critics, such as Ravi Batra, argue that the capitalist system has inherent biases favoring those who already possess greater resources. The inequality may be propagated through inheritance and economic policy. Rich people are in a position to give their children a better education and inherited wealth and that this can create or increase large differences in wealth between people who do not differ in ability or effort. One study shows that in the United States 43.35% of the people in the _[Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes "Forbes")_ magazine "400 richest individuals" list were already rich enough at birth to qualify.<sup id="cite_ref-147"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup> Another study indicated that in the United States wealth, race and schooling are important to the inheritance of economic status, but that IQ is not a major contributor and the genetic transmission of IQ is even less important.<sup id="cite_ref-148"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup> Batra has argued that the tax and benefit legislation in the United States since the [Reagan presidency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan "Presidency of Ronald Reagan") has contributed greatly to the inequalities and economic problems and should be repealed.<sup id="cite_ref-149"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup>

### Market instability\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Market instability")\]

Critics of capitalism, particularly Marxists, identify market instability as a permanent feature of capitalist economy.<sup id="cite_ref-onfreetrade_150-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-onfreetrade-150">[150]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-isrcrisis_151-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-isrcrisis-151">[151]</a></sup> Marx believed that the unplanned and explosive growth of capitalism does not occur in a smooth manner, but is interrupted by periods of overproduction in which stagnation or decline occur (i.e. [recessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recessions "Recessions")).<sup id="cite_ref-communistmanifesto_152-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-communistmanifesto-152">[152]</a></sup> In the view of Marxists, several contradictions in the capitalist [mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production "Mode of production") are present, particularly the internal contradiction between anarchy in the sphere of capital (i.e. [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market")) and socialised production in the sphere of labor (i.e. [industrialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialism "Industrialism")).<sup id="cite_ref-anti-duhring_153-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-anti-duhring-153">[153]</a></sup> In _[The Communist Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto "The Communist Manifesto")_, Marx and Engels highlighted what they saw as a uniquely capitalist juxtaposition of overabundance and poverty: "Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism. And why? Because there is too much civilization, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce".<sup id="cite_ref-communistmanifesto_152-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-communistmanifesto-152">[152]</a></sup>

Some scholars blame the [financial crisis of 2007–2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008 "Financial crisis of 2007–2008") on the neoliberal capitalist model.<sup id="cite_ref-160"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup> Following the banking crisis of 2007, economist and former Chair of the [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve "Federal Reserve"), [Alan Greenspan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan "Alan Greenspan") told the United States Congress on 23 October 2008 that "\[t\]his modern risk-management paradigm held sway for decades.

### Property\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Property")\]

[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon "Pierre-Joseph Proudhon") and [Friedrich Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels") argue that the [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market") is not necessarily free, but weighted towards those who already own private property.<sup id="cite_ref-histmaterial_96-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-histmaterial-96">[96]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-propertytheft_163-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-propertytheft-163">[163]</a></sup> They view capitalist regulations, including the enforcement of [private property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property "Private property") on land and exclusive rights to natural resources, as unjustly [enclosing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure "Enclosure") upon what should be owned by all, forcing those without private property to sell their labor to capitalists and landlords in a market favorable to the latter, thus forcing workers to accept low wages to survive.<sup id="cite_ref-meaningmarx_164-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-meaningmarx-164">[164]</a></sup> In his criticism of capitalism, Proudhon believed that the emphasis on private property is the problem. He argued that [property is theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_is_theft "Property is theft"), arguing that private property leads to despotism: "Now, property necessarily engenders despotism—the government of caprice, the reign of libidinous pleasure. That is so clearly the essence of property that, to be convinced of it, one need but remember what it is, and observe what happens around him. Property is the right to use and abuse".<sup id="cite_ref-propertytheft_163-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-propertytheft-163">[163]</a></sup> Many left-wing anarchists, such as [anarchist communists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_communist "Anarchist communist"), believe in replacing capitalist private property with a system where people can lay claim to things based on personal use and claim that "\[private\] property is the domination of an individual, or a coalition of individuals, over things; it is not the claim of any person or persons to the use of things" and "this is, usufruct, a very different matter. Property means the monopoly of wealth, the right to prevent others using it, whether the owner needs it or not".<sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup>

[Mutualists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory) "Mutualism (economic theory)") and some anarchists support markets and private property, but not in their present form.<sup id="cite_ref-mutualiststudy_166-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-mutualiststudy-166">[166]</a></sup> They argue that particular aspects of modern capitalism violate the ability of individuals to trade in the absence of coercion. Mutualists support markets and private property in the product of labor, but only when these markets guarantee that workers [will realize for themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative "Worker cooperative") the value of their labor.<sup id="cite_ref-propertytheft_163-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-propertytheft-163">[163]</a></sup>

In recent times, most economies have extended private property rights to include such things as [patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patents "Patents") and [copyrights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyrights "Copyrights"). Critics see these so-called [intellectual property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property "Intellectual property") laws as coercive against those with few prior resources. They argue that such regulations discourage the sharing of ideas and encourage nonproductive [rent seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_seeking "Rent seeking") behavior, both of which enact a [deadweight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss "Deadweight loss") on the economy, erecting a prohibitive barrier to entry into the market.<sup id="cite_ref-copyright_167-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-copyright-167">[167]</a></sup> Not all pro-capitalists support the concept of copyrights, but those who do argue that compensation to the creator is necessary as an incentive.<sup id="cite_ref-copyright_167-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-copyright-167">[167]</a></sup>

[Environmentalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalist "Environmentalist") and scholars have argued that capitalism requires continual [economic growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth "Economic growth") and that it will inevitably deplete the finite natural resources of Earth and cause [mass extinctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction "Holocene extinction") of animal and plant life.<sup id="cite_ref-168"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-169"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-170"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-171"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup> Such critics argue that while [neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism "Neoliberalism"), the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has indeed increased global trade, it has also destroyed traditional ways of life, exacerbated inequality, increased global [poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty "Poverty"), and that environmental indicators indicate massive [environmental degradation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation "Environmental degradation") since the late 1970s.<sup id="cite_ref-Duménil_172-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-Dum%C3%A9nil-172">[172]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-173"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-174"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-175"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup>

One of the main modern criticism to the [sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability "Sustainability") of capitalism is related to the so-called commodity chains, or production/consumption chains.<sup id="cite_ref-181"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-unpop_182-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-unpop-182">[182]</a></sup> These terms refer to the network of transfers of materials and commodities that is currently part of the functioning of the global capitalist system. Examples include high tech commodities produced in countries with low average wages by multinational firms and then being sold in distant high income countries; materials and resources being extracted in some countries, turned into finished products in some others and sold as commodities in further ones; and countries exchanging with each other the same kind of commodities for the sake of consumers' choice (e.g. Europe both exporting and importing cars to and from the United States). According to critics, such processes, all of which produce pollution and waste of resources, are an integral part of the functioning of capitalism (i.e. its "[metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism")").<sup id="cite_ref-unu_183-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-unu-183">[183]</a></sup>

Critics note that the statistical methods used in calculating [ecological footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_footprint "Ecological footprint") have been criticized and some find the whole concept of counting how much land is used to be flawed, arguing that there is nothing intrinsically negative about using more land to improve living standards (rejection of the [intrinsic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsicism "Intrinsicism") value of nature).<sup id="cite_ref-184"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-184">[184]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-usc_185-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-usc-185">[185]</a></sup>

A team of Finnish scientists hired by the UN Secretary-General to aid the 2019 Global Sustainable Development Report assert that capitalism as we know it is moribund, primarily because it focuses on short term profits and fails to look after the long term needs of people and the environment which is being subjected to unsustainable exploitation.

### Profit motive\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Profit motive")\]

The majority of criticisms against the [profit motive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_motive "Profit motive") centre on the idea that the profit motive encourages [selfishness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfishness "Selfishness") and [greed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greed "Greed"), rather than serving the public good or necessarily creating an increase in net wealth. Critics of the profit motive argue that companies disregard morals or public safety in the pursuit of profits. Capitalists seek to reduce spending to increase profits, often coming at the expense of workers, such as the cutting of wages and [downsizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff "Layoff"), causing [unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment "Unemployment"). The reason why the profit motive is harmful is because of the fundamental contradiction between the interests of capitalists and workers, as capitalists want to pay their workers as little as possible and work them as much as possible to increase profits, whereas workers want to be paid fairly and have their increased productivity result in fewer working hours. This fundamental contradiction, critics argue, shows how illogical capitalism is, as it is a system in which two classes have fundamentally opposite interests which create conflict.<sup id="cite_ref-196"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-197"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-197">[197]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-198"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-198">[198]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-199"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-199">[199]</a></sup>

Wage labor has long been compared to slavery.<sup id="cite_ref-200"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup> As a result, the phrase "[wage slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics#Wage_slavery "Labour economics")" is often utilized as a pejorative for wage labor.<sup id="cite_ref-201"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup> Similarly, advocates of slavery looked upon the "comparative evils of Slave Society and of Free Society, of slavery to human Masters and slavery to Capital"<sup id="cite_ref-Fitzhugh_1857_xvi_202-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-Fitzhugh_1857_xvi-202">[202]</a></sup> and proceeded to argue that wage slavery was actually worse than [chattel slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattel_slavery "Chattel slavery").<sup id="cite_ref-203"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-203">[203]</a></sup> Slavery apologists like [George Fitzhugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Fitzhugh "George Fitzhugh") contended that workers only accepted wage labor with the passage of time as they became "familiarised and inattentive to the infected social atmosphere they continually inhale".<sup id="cite_ref-Fitzhugh_1857_xvi_202-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-Fitzhugh_1857_xvi-202">[202]</a></sup> Scholars have debated the exact relationship between wage labor, slavery, and capitalism at length, especially for the [Antebellum South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antebellum_South "Antebellum South").<sup id="cite_ref-204"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-204">[204]</a></sup>

With the advent of the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution"), thinkers such as [Pierre-Joseph Proudhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon "Pierre-Joseph Proudhon") and [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx") elaborated the comparison between wage labor and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use<sup id="cite_ref-reformrevolution_11-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-reformrevolution-11">[11]</a></sup> while [Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite "Luddite") emphasized the [dehumanisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanisation "Dehumanisation") brought about by machines. Before the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"), Southern defenders of [African American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American "African American") slavery invoked the concept of wage slavery to favorably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the North.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The United States abolished slavery during the Civil War, but labor union activists found the metaphor useful. According to [Lawrence Glickman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_B._Glickman "Lawrence B. Glickman"), in the [Gilded Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age "Gilded Age") "references abounded in the labor press, and it is hard to find a speech by a labour leader without the phrase".<sup id="cite_ref-205"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup>

—[Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx")

According to [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky"), analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") era. In his 1791 book _On the Limits of State Action_, [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism "Liberalism") thinker [Wilhelm von Humboldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt "Wilhelm von Humboldt") explained how "whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness" and so when the laborer works under external control, "we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is".<sup id="cite_ref-207"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-207">[207]</a></sup> Both the [Milgram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment "Milgram experiment") and [Stanford experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment "Stanford prison experiment") have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Additionally, as per anthropologist [David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber "David Graeber"), the earliest wage labor contracts known about were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves (usually the owner would receive a share of the money and the slave another, with which to maintain his or her living expenses). According to Graeber, such arrangements were quite common in New World slavery as well, whether in the United States or Brazil.<sup id="cite_ref-208"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-208">[208]</a></sup> [C.

[Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith") noted that employers often conspire together to keep wages low:<sup id="cite_ref-214"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-214">[214]</a></sup>

We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate ... It is not, however, difficult to foresee which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms.

To [Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist "Marxist") and [anarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist "Anarchist") thinkers like [Mikhail Bakunin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin "Mikhail Bakunin") and [Peter Kropotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin "Peter Kropotkin"), wage slavery was a [class condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(social) "Class (social)") in place due to the existence of [private property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property "Private property") and the [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state"). This class situation rested primarily on:

1.  The existence of property not intended for active use.
2.  The concentration of ownership in few hands.
3.  The lack of direct access by workers to the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production "Means of production") and consumption goods.
4.  The perpetuation of a [reserve army of unemployed workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_army_of_labour "Reserve army of labour").

For Marxists, labor as commodity, which is how they regard wage labor,<sup id="cite_ref-215"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup> provides a fundamental point of attack against capitalism.<sup id="cite_ref-216"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-216">[216]</a></sup> "It can be persuasively argued", noted one concerned philosopher, "that the conception of the worker's labour as a commodity confirms Marx's stigmatization of the wage system of private capitalism as 'wage-slavery;' that is, as an instrument of the capitalist's for reducing the worker's condition to that of a slave, if not below it".<sup id="cite_ref-217"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-217">[217]</a></sup> That this objection is fundamental follows immediately from Marx's conclusion that wage labor is the very foundation of capitalism: "Without a class dependent on wages, the moment individuals confront each other as free persons, there can be no production of surplus value; without the production of surplus-value there can be no capitalist production, and hence no capital and no capitalist!".<sup id="cite_ref-218"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-218">[218]</a></sup>

### Supply and demand\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Supply and demand")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/SMD_Demand_Curve.svg/220px-SMD_Demand_Curve.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SMD_Demand_Curve.svg)

A hypothetical market which cannot be described in the standard theory of supply and demand. The Sonnenschein–Mantel–Debreu theorem implies the existence of such a market.

At least two assumptions are necessary for the validity of the standard model: first, that [supply and demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand "Supply and demand") are independent; and second, that supply is "constrained by a fixed resource". If these conditions do not hold, then the [Marshallian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshallian_surplus "Marshallian surplus") model cannot be sustained. [Sraffa's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_Sraffa "Piero Sraffa") critique focused on the inconsistency (except in implausible circumstances) of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good.<sup id="cite_ref-219"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-219">[219]</a></sup> The notability of Sraffa's critique is also demonstrated by [Paul A. Samuelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_A._Samuelson "Paul A. Samuelson")'s comments and engagements with it over many years, stating:

> What a cleaned-up version of Sraffa (1926) establishes is how nearly empty are all of Marshall's [partial equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_equilibrium "Partial equilibrium") boxes. To a logical purist of Wittgenstein and Sraffa class, the Marshallian partial equilibrium box of constant cost is even more empty than the box of increasing cost.<sup id="cite_ref-220"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-220">[220]</a></sup>

Aggregate excess demand in a market is the difference between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as a function of price. In the model with an upward-sloping supply curve and downward-sloping demand curve, the aggregate excess demand function only intersects the axis at one point, namely at the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. The [Sonnenschein–Mantel–Debreu theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnenschein%E2%80%93Mantel%E2%80%93Debreu_theorem "Sonnenschein–Mantel–Debreu theorem") shows that the standard model cannot be rigorously derived in general from [general equilibrium theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_equilibrium_theory "General equilibrium theory").<sup id="cite_ref-221"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-221">[221]</a></sup>

The model of prices being determined by supply and demand assumes [perfect competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition "Perfect competition"). However, "economists have no adequate model of how individuals and firms adjust prices in a competitive model. If all participants are price-takers by definition, then the actor who adjusts prices to eliminate excess demand is not specified".<sup id="cite_ref-222"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-222">[222]</a></sup> Goodwin, Nelson, Ackerman and Weisskopf write:

> If we mistakenly confuse [precision with accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision "Accuracy and precision"), then we might be misled into thinking that an explanation expressed in precise mathematical or graphical terms is somehow more rigorous or useful than one that takes into account particulars of history, institutions or business strategy. This is not the case. Therefore, it is important not to put too much confidence in the apparent precision of supply and demand graphs. Supply and demand analysis is a useful precisely formulated conceptual tool that clever people have devised to help us gain an abstract understanding of a complex world. It does not—nor should it be expected to—give us in addition an accurate and complete description of any particular real world market.<sup id="cite_ref-223"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-223">[223]</a></sup>

### Surveillance\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Surveillance")\]

According to Harvard academic [Shoshana Zuboff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff "Shoshana Zuboff"), a new genus of capitalism, [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism "Surveillance capitalism") monetizes data acquired through [surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance "Surveillance").<sup id="cite_ref-224"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-224">[224]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-faz1_225-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-faz1-225">[225]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-226"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-226">[226]</a></sup> She states that it was first discovered and consolidated at [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google"), emerged due to the "coupling of the vast powers of the [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics "Digital electronics") with the radical indifference and intrinsic narcissism of the [financial capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_capitalism "Financial capitalism") and its [neoliberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberal "Neoliberal") vision that have dominated commerce for at least three decades, especially in the Anglo economies"<sup id="cite_ref-faz1_225-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-faz1-225">[225]</a></sup> and depends on the global architecture of computer mediation which produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power she calls "Big Other".<sup id="cite_ref-ssrn_227-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-ssrn-227">[227]</a></sup>

This fusion of control and freedom, seen through changes in sexuality and race, is a response to the growing privatization of data, networks, public services, and physical spaces, and also to the simultaneous entry of publicity and paranoia into people's lives.<sup id="cite_ref-229"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup>

### Racism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Racism")\]

According to [Immanuel Wallerstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Wallerstein "Immanuel Wallerstein"), [institutional racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism "Institutional racism") has been "one of the most significant pillars" of the capitalist system and serves as "the ideological justification for the hierarchization of the work-force and its highly unequal distributions of reward".<sup id="cite_ref-230"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup> Critics of capitalims argue that racism benefits capitalists in several ways. Racism divides the working class and prevents them from uniting to demand better wages and working conditions. Capitalists benefit from competition and hostility between workers because it reduces their bargaining power and ability to organise. Racism was used to justify the exploitation and oppression of certain groups of people for economic gain, such as in the era of [slavery in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States "Slavery in the United States"). Capitalists benefitted from the scapegoating of [Jewish people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews") as a way to divert attention from the real cause of the problems. An example of this is [Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford "Henry Ford"), founder of the [Ford Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company "Ford Motor Company"), who spread Anti-Semitic propaganda in his newspaper _[The Dearborn Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dearborn_Independent "The Dearborn Independent")_. Others view that while capitalism generally transformed racism depending on local circumstances, racism is not necessary for capitalism.<sup id="cite_ref-231"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup>

Many theorists believed that a capitalistic free-market is the best remedy possible for racism in a functioning society because even if some business owners engaged in discriminatory wage practices targeting minority ethnic groups, entrepreneurs would take advantage of getting a equally-capable worker for a lower cost, ultimately boosting the company or business as a whole. According to Jim Sidanius and Felicia Pratto, despite the fluidity of this theory, reconciling the free market theory with the observed data presents challenges, as those who are in support of free market capitalism also often exhibit a higher likelihood of discriminating against ethnic minorities. <sup id="cite_ref-232"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup> Left-wing commentators have argued that capitalism promotes racism alongside [culture wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_wars "Culture wars") over issues such as [immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration "Immigration") and representation of [ethnic minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_minorities "Ethnic minorities") whilst refusing to address [economic inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality "Economic inequality").<sup id="cite_ref-233"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-234"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup>

### Underdevelopment\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Underdevelopment")\]

Marxist and Neo-Marxist theorists including Wallerstein, [Andre Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Frank "Andre Frank") and [Samir Amin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samir_Amin "Samir Amin") have linked [underdevelopment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdevelopment "Underdevelopment") with capitalism, emphasising the relationship between the metropolist centre and the periphery colony, theory of 'unequal exchange' and constituents of a single world capitalist system.<sup id="cite_ref-235"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-236"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup> [Dependency theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_theory "Dependency theory") posits that peripheral economies are subordinated to the interests of the capitalist world economy which was initially established by European colonialism.<sup id="cite_ref-237"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup>

Using the Latin American dependency model, the Guyanese Marxist historian [Walter Rodney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rodney "Walter Rodney"), in his book _[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Europe_Underdeveloped_Africa "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa")_, described in 1972 an Africa that had been consciously exploited by European imperialists, leading directly to the modern underdevelopment of most of the continent.<sup id="cite_ref-238"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-238">[238]</a></sup>

The concept of [uneven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uneven_development "Uneven development") derived from the political theories of [Leon Trotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky "Leon Trotsky").<sup id="cite_ref-239"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-239">[239]</a></sup> This concept was developed in combination with the related theory of permanent revolution to explain the historical context of Russia. He would later elaborate on this theory to explain the specific, capitalist laws of uneven development in 1930.<sup id="cite_ref-240"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-240">[240]</a></sup> According to biographer Ian Thatcher, this theory would be later generalised to "the entire history of mankind".<sup id="cite_ref-241"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-241">[241]</a></sup>

### Austrian School\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Austrian School")\]

[Austrian School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School "Austrian School") economists have argued that capitalism can organize itself into a complex system without an external guidance or central planning mechanism. [Friedrich Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek "Friedrich Hayek") considered the phenomenon of [self-organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organisation "Self-organisation") as underpinning capitalism. Prices serve as a signal as to the urgent and unfulfilled wants of people and the opportunity to earn profits if successful, or absorb losses if resources are used poorly or left idle, gives entrepreneurs [incentive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive "Incentive") to use their [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersed_knowledge "Dispersed knowledge") and resources to satisfy those wants. Thus, the activities of millions of people, each seeking their own interest, are coordinated.<sup id="cite_ref-walberg2003_242-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#cite_note-walberg2003-242">[242]</a></sup>

### Ayn Rand\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_capitalism&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Ayn Rand")\]

The novelist [Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand "Ayn Rand") made positive moral defenses of _laissez-faire_ capitalism, most notably in her 1957 novel _[Atlas Shrugged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged "Atlas Shrugged")_ and in her 1966 collection of essays _[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism:_The_Unknown_Ideal "Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal")_.

It's certainly true that Jesus was always blessing the poor, challenging the rich, mixing with despised tax-gatherers and speaking of a time when the social order is overturned and 'the last shall be first'. It's also true, as Myers reminds us, that many of Jesus's parables deal with clearly economic concerns: farming, shepherding, being in debt, doing hard labour, being excluded from banquets and the houses of the rich.

Deceit, through [contraband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraband "Contraband"), is absolutely key to the expansion of slavery in South America. When historians talk about the Atlantic market revolution, they are talking about capitalism. And when they are talking about capitalism, they are talking about slavery. And when they are talking about slavery, they are talking about corruption and crime. Not in a moral sense, in that the slave system was a crime against humanity. That it was. But it was also a crime in a technical sense: probably as many enslaved Africans came into South America as contraband, to avoid taxes and other lingering restrictions, as legally.

Inequality is indeed increasing almost everywhere in the postindustrial capitalist world. But despite what many on the left think, this is not the result of politics, nor is politics likely to reverse it, for the problem is more deeply rooted and intractable than generally recognized. Inequality is an inevitable product of capitalist activity, and expanding equality of opportunity only increases it—because some individuals and communities are simply better able than others to exploit the opportunities for development and advancement that capitalism affords.

Without an accompanying welfare state in which social programs funded by a progressive income tax redistribute from the rich to the poor, capitalism can be a deeply unfair system where a small, well-connected elite captures a majority of the wealth and power, and not necessarily through meritocratic processes.

He noted that the immense and largely unregulated business of spreading financial risk widely, through the use of exotic financial instruments called [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance) "Derivative (finance)"), had gotten out of control and had added to the havoc of today's crisis. As far back as 1994, Mr. Greenspan staunchly and successfully opposed tougher regulation on derivatives. But on Thursday, he agreed that the multitrillion-dollar market for [credit default swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap "Credit default swap"), instruments originally created to insure bond investors against the risk of default, needed to be restrained. 'This modern risk-management paradigm held sway for decades,' he said. 'The whole intellectual edifice, however, collapsed in the summer of last year.'

Pressed by [Waxman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Waxman "Henry Waxman"), Greenspan conceded a more serious flaw in his own philosophy that unfettered free markets sit at the root of a superior economy. 'I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of organizations, specifically banks and others, were such as that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms,' Greenspan said. ... 'In other words, you found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working,' Waxman said. 'Absolutely, precisely,' Greenspan replied. "You know, that's precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well.'

It began in big countries like United Kingdom and the United States. Then it was implemented in Europe, and later in Japan, and later around the world in general. So this is a new phase of capitalism.

Neoliberalism—which IMF researchers Jonathan Ostry, Prakash Loungani, and Davide Furceri loosely define as the opening of economies to foreign capital along with a reduction in government debt burdens—has been the dominant trend in economic policymaking over the past 30 years. ... But now it seems some at the IMF aren't so sure this tradition is all it's been cracked up to be. In their paper, Ostray, Loungani, and Furceri argue that these goals have both hampered the economic growth that neoliberalism champions and exacerbated the rise of inequality.

    The term is not without its critics, as [Roediger 2007b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_capitalism#CITEREFRoediger2007b), p. 247, notes: "\[T\]he challenge to loose connections of wage (or white) slavery to chattel slavery was led by [Frederick Douglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass "Frederick Douglass") and other Black, often fugitive, abolitionists. Their challenge was mercilessly concrete. Douglass, who tried out speeches in work places before giving them in halls, was far from unable to speak to or hear white workers, but he and [William Wells Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wells_Brown "William Wells Brown") did challenge metaphors regarding white slavery sharply. They noted, for example, that their escapes from slavery had left job openings and wondered if any white workers wanted to take the jobs."
