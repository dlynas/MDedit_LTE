The **Arab Revolt** ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): الثورة العربية _al-Thawra al-‘Arabiyya_), also known as the **Great Arab Revolt** (الثورة العربية الكبرى _al-Thawra al-‘Arabiyya al-Kubrā_), was an armed uprising by the [Hashemite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashemites "Hashemites")\-led Arabs of the [Hejaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz "Hejaz")<sup id="cite_ref-Matthew_Hughes_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Matthew_Hughes-9">[9]</a></sup> against the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") amidst the [Middle Eastern theatre of World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern_theatre_of_World_War_I "Middle Eastern theatre of World War I").

On the basis of the [McMahon–Hussein Correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence "McMahon–Hussein Correspondence"), exchanged between [Henry McMahon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_McMahon "Henry McMahon") of the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland") and [Hussein bin Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_bin_Ali,_King_of_Hejaz "Hussein bin Ali, King of Hejaz") of the [Kingdom of Hejaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hejaz "Kingdom of Hejaz"), the rebellion against the ruling [Turks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people") was officially initiated at [Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca "Mecca") on 10 June 1916.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-11">[a]</a></sup> The primary goal of the Arab rebels was to establish an independent and unified [Arab state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world "Arab world") stretching from [Aleppo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo "Aleppo") to [Aden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden "Aden"), which the British government had promised to recognize.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-12">[11]</a></sup>

The [Sharifian Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharifian_Army "Sharifian Army"), led by Hussein and the Hashemites with backing from the British military's [Egyptian Expeditionary Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Expeditionary_Force "Egyptian Expeditionary Force"), successfully fought and expelled the Ottoman military presence from much of the [Hejaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz "Hejaz") and [Transjordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjordan_(region) "Transjordan (region)"). By 1918, the rebels had [captured Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Damascus "Capture of Damascus") and proclaimed the [Arab Kingdom of Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Kingdom_of_Syria "Arab Kingdom of Syria"), a short-lived monarchy that was led by Hussein's son [Faisal I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal_I_of_Iraq "Faisal I of Iraq").

Having covertly signed the [Sykes–Picot Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement "Sykes–Picot Agreement") with the [French Third Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic"), the British reneged on their promise to support the Arabs' establishment of a singular Arab state.<sup id="cite_ref-SPmemo_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-SPmemo-13">[12]</a></sup> Instead, the Arab-majority Ottoman territories of the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East") were broken up into a number of [League of Nations mandates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations_mandate "League of Nations mandate"), jointly controlled by the British and the French. Amidst the [partition of the Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Partition of the Ottoman Empire"), the defeated Ottomans' mainland in [Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia") came under a joint military occupation by the victorious [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I "Allies of World War I"), though this was gradually broken by the [Turkish War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_War_of_Independence "Turkish War of Independence"), which established the present-day [Republic of Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey").

The [rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_nationalism_in_the_Ottoman_Empire "Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire") dates from at least 1821. [Arab nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism "Arab nationalism") has its roots in the [Mashriq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashriq "Mashriq") (the Arab lands east of [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt")), particularly in countries of the [Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant "Levant"). The political orientation of Arab nationalists before [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") was generally moderate. Their demands were of a reformist nature and generally limited to autonomy, a greater use of [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic "Arabic") in education and changes in peacetime [conscription in the Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_Ottoman_Empire "Conscription in the Ottoman Empire") to allow Arab conscripts local service in the Ottoman army.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-14">[13]</a></sup>

The [Young Turk Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turk_Revolution "Young Turk Revolution") began on 3 July 1908 and quickly spread throughout the empire. As a result, Sultan [Abdul Hamid II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hamid_II "Abdul Hamid II") was forced to announce the restoration of the [1876 constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Constitution of the Ottoman Empire") and the reconvening of the [Ottoman parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Assembly_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire"). The period is known as the [Second Constitutional Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Era "Second Constitutional Era"). In the 1908 elections, the Young Turks' [Committee of Union and Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Union_and_Progress "Committee of Union and Progress") (CUP) managed to gain the upper hand against the [Liberal Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_and_Accord_Party "Freedom and Accord Party"), led by [Sultanzade Sabahaddin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanzade_Sabahaddin "Sultanzade Sabahaddin"). The new parliament had 142 [Turks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people"), 60 [Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs"), 25 [Albanians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians "Albanians"), 23 [Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks "Greeks"), 12 [Armenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians "Armenians") (including four [Dashnaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashnaks "Dashnaks") and two [Hunchaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democrat_Hunchakian_Party "Social Democrat Hunchakian Party")), five [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews"), four [Bulgarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarians "Bulgarians"), three [Serbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs "Serbs") and one [Vlach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlachs "Vlachs").

The CUP now gave more emphasis to centralisation and a modernisation.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> It preached a message that was a mixture of [pan-Islamism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Islamism "Pan-Islamism"), [Ottomanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottomanism "Ottomanism"), and [pan-Turkism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Turkism "Pan-Turkism"), which was adjusted as the conditions warranted. At heart, the CUP were Turkish nationalists who wanted to see the Turks as the dominant group within the Ottoman Empire, which antagonised Arab leaders and prompted them to think in similarly nationalistic terms.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-15">[14]</a></sup> Arab members of the parliament supported the [countercoup of 1909](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31_March_Incident "31 March Incident"), which aimed to dismantle the constitutional system and to restore the absolute monarchy of Sultan [Abdul Hamid II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hamid_II "Abdul Hamid II"). The dethroned sultan attempted to restore the [Ottoman Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Caliphate "Ottoman Caliphate") by putting an end to the [secular policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularity "Secularity") of the Young Turks, but he was, in turn, driven away to exile in Selanik by the [31 March Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31_March_Incident "31 March Incident") in which the Young Turks defeated the countercoup, and he was eventually replaced by his brother [Mehmed V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_V "Mehmed V").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In 1913, intellectuals and politicians from the Mashriq met in Paris at the [First Arab Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Congress_of_1913 "Arab Congress of 1913"). They produced a set of demands for greater autonomy and equality within the Ottoman Empire, including for elementary and secondary education in Arab lands to be delivered in Arabic, for peacetime Arab conscripts to the Ottoman army to serve near their home region and for at least three Arab ministers in the Ottoman cabinet.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-16">[15]</a></sup>

## Forces\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arab_Revolt&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Forces")\]

It is estimated that the Arab forces involved in the revolt numbered around 5,000 soldiers.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_34_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_34-17">[16]</a></sup> This number however probably applies to the Arab regulars who fought during the [Sinai and Palestine campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_and_Palestine_campaign "Sinai and Palestine campaign") with [Edmund Allenby's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Allenby,_1st_Viscount_Allenby "Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby") [Egyptian Expeditionary Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Expeditionary_Force "Egyptian Expeditionary Force"), and not the irregular forces under the direction of [T. E. Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._E._Lawrence "T. E. Lawrence")<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-18">[17]</a></sup> and [Faisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal_I_of_Iraq "Faisal I of Iraq"). On a few occasions, particularly during the final campaign into [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria"), this number would grow significantly. The [Arab Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Bureau "Arab Bureau") of the British Empire in [Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo "Cairo") believed that the revolt would draw the support of all Arabs throughout the Ottoman Empire and Arab lands.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-:4-19">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:2_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-:2-20">[19]</a></sup> Faisal and Sharif Hussein reportedly expected to be joined by 100,000 Arab troops. However, the large desertions predicted British Arab Bureau never materialized as the majority of Arab officers remained loyal to the Ottomans until the end.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_19-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-:4-19">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:3_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-:3-21">[20]</a></sup> Many Arabs joined the Revolt sporadically, often as a campaign was in progress or only when the fighting entered their home region.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-22">[21]</a></sup> During the [Battle of Aqaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aqaba "Battle of Aqaba"), for instance, while the initial Arab force numbered only a few hundred, over a thousand more from local tribes joined them for the final assault on [Aqaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqaba "Aqaba"). Estimates of Faisal's effective forces vary, but through most of 1918 at least, they may have numbered as high as 30,000 men.

The [Hashemite Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashemites "Hashemites") comprised two distinctive forces: tribal irregulars who waged a guerrilla war against the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") and the [Sharifian Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharifian_Army "Sharifian Army"), which was recruited from Ottoman Arab POWs and fought in conventional battles.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-23">[22]</a></sup> Hashemite forces were initially poorly equipped, but later were to receive significant supplies of weapons, most notably rifles and machine guns from [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic").<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-24">[23]</a></sup>

In the early days of the revolt, Faisal's forces were largely made up of [Bedouins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") and other nomadic desert tribes, who were only loosely allied, loyal more to their respective tribes than the overall cause.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_21_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_21-25">[24]</a></sup> The Bedouin would not fight unless paid in advance with gold coin,<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-26">[25]</a></sup> and by the end of 1916, the French had spent 1.25 million gold [francs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_franc "French franc") in subsidizing the revolt.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_21_25-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_21-25">[24]</a></sup> By September 1918, the British were spending [£](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling")220,000/month to subsidize the revolt.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_21_25-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_21-25">[24]</a></sup>

Faisal had hoped that he could convince Arab troops serving in the Ottoman Army to mutiny and join his cause, but the [Ottoman government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_organisation_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "State organisation of the Ottoman Empire") sent most of its Arab troops to the Western front-lines of the war, and thus only a handful of deserters actually joined the Arab forces until later in the campaign.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_24_27-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_24-27">[26]</a></sup>

By the beginning of the First World War, Arab conscripts constituted about 30% of the wartime [Ottoman military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Military of the Ottoman Empire") of 3 million, serving in all ranks from the lowest to the highest and forming a crucial component of the [Ottoman Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Army_(1861%E2%80%931922) "Ottoman Army (1861–1922)").<sup id="cite_ref-:2_20-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-:2-20">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-28">[27]</a></sup> Ottoman troops in the Hejaz numbered 20,000 men by 1917.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_24_27-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_24-27">[26]</a></sup> At the outbreak of the revolt in June 1916, the VII Corps of the [Fourth Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Army_(Ottoman_Empire) "Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)") was stationed in the Hejaz to be joined by the 58th Infantry Division commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Ali Necib Pasha, the 1st _Kuvvie- Mürettebe_ (Provisional Force) led by General Mehmed Cemal Pasha, which had the responsibility of safeguarding the [Hejaz railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz_railway "Hejaz railway") and the [Hejaz Expeditionary Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz_Expeditionary_Force "Hejaz Expeditionary Force") ([Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language "Turkish language"): _Hicaz Kuvve-i Seferiyesi_), which was under the command of General [Fakhri Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhri_Pasha "Fakhri Pasha").<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_24_27-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_24-27">[26]</a></sup> In face of increasing attacks on the Hejaz railway, the 2nd _Kuvve i Mürettebe_ was created by 1917.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_24_27-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_24-27">[26]</a></sup> The Ottoman force included a number of Arab units who stayed loyal to the [Sultan-Caliph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sultans_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire") and fought well against the Allies.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_24_27-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_24-27">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-30">[b]</a></sup>

The Ottoman troops enjoyed an advantage over the [Hashemite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashemites "Hashemites") troops at first in that they were well supplied with modern German weapons.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_24_27-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_24-27">[26]</a></sup> In addition, the Ottoman forces had the support of both the [Ottoman Aviation Squadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Aviation_Squadrons "Ottoman Aviation Squadrons"), air squadrons from [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire "German Empire") and the [Ottoman Gendarmerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Gendarmerie "Ottoman Gendarmerie") or _zaptı_.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_23_31-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_23-31">[29]</a></sup> Moreover, the Ottomans relied upon the support of Emir [Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Rashid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saud_bin_Abdulaziz_Al_Rashid "Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Rashid") of the [Emirate of Jabal Shammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Jabal_Shammar "Emirate of Jabal Shammar"), whose tribesmen dominated what is now northern [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia") and tied down both the Hashemites and Saʻudi forces with the threat of their raiding attacks.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-32">[30]</a></sup>

The great weakness of the Ottoman forces was they were at the end of a long and tenuous supply line in the form of the Hejaz railway, and because of their logistical weaknesses, were often forced to fight on the defensive.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_24_27-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_24-27">[26]</a></sup> Ottoman offensives against the Hashemite forces more often faltered due to supply problems than to the actions of the enemy.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_24_27-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_24-27">[26]</a></sup>

The main contribution of the Arab Revolt to the war was to pin down tens of thousands of Ottoman troops who otherwise might have been used to attack the [Suez Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal "Suez Canal") and conquering [Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus"), allowing the British to undertake offensive operations with a lower risk of counter-attack.

The Ottoman Empire took part in the [Middle Eastern theatre of World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern_theatre_of_World_War_I "Middle Eastern theatre of World War I"), under the terms of the [Ottoman–German Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%E2%80%93German_Alliance "Ottoman–German Alliance"). Many Arab nationalist figures in [Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus") and [Beirut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut "Beirut") were arrested, then tortured. The flag of the resistance was designed by Sir [Mark Sykes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sykes "Mark Sykes"), in an effort to create a feeling of "Arab-ness" in order to fuel the revolt.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-34">[32]</a></sup>

When [Herbert Kitchener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Kitchener,_1st_Earl_Kitchener "Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener") was Consul-General in [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Egypt "Sultanate of Egypt"), contacts between [Abdullah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_I_of_Jordan "Abdullah I of Jordan") and Kitchener had eventually culminated in a [telegram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy "Telegraphy") of 1 November 1914 from Kitchener (recently appointed as Secretary of War) to Hussein wherein [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland") would, in exchange for support from the Arabs of Hejaz, "guarantee the independence, rights and privileges of the [Sharifate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharifate_of_Mecca "Sharifate of Mecca") against all foreign external aggression, in particular that of the Ottomans."<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-35">[33]</a></sup> The [Sharif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_of_Mecca "Sharif of Mecca") indicated that he could not break with the Ottomans immediately, and it did not happen till the following year. From 14 July 1915, to 10 March 1916, a total of [ten letters, five from each side, were exchanged between Sir Henry McMahon and Sherif Hussein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence "McMahon–Hussein Correspondence"). Hussein's letter of 18 February 1916 appealed to McMahon for £50,000 in gold plus weapons, ammunition, and food. Faisal claimed that he was awaiting the arrival of 'not less than 100,000 people' for the planned revolt. McMahon's reply of 10 March 1916 confirmed British agreement to the requests and concluded the correspondence. Hussein, who until then had officially been on the Ottoman side, was now convinced that his assistance to the [Triple Entente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Entente "Triple Entente") would be rewarded by an Arab empire encompassing the entire span between Egypt and [Qajar Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qajar_Iran "Qajar Iran"), with the exception of imperial possessions and interests in [Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait "Kuwait"), [Aden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden_Protectorate "Aden Protectorate"), and the [Syrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria") coast. He decided to join the [Allied camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I "Allies of World War I") immediately, because of rumours that he would soon be deposed as Sharif of [Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca "Mecca") by the Ottoman government in favor of [Sharif Ali Haidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BFAl%C4%AB_%E1%B8%A4aydar_P%C4%81sh%C4%81 "ʿAlī Ḥaydar Pāshā"), leader of the rival Zaʻid family.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-36">[34]</a></sup> The much-publicized executions of the [Arab nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism "Arab nationalism") leaders in [Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus") led Hussein to fear for his life if he were deposed in favour of Ali Haidar.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_34_17-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_34-17">[16]</a></sup>

In June 1916, the British sent out a number of officials to assist the revolt in the [Hejaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz "Hejaz"), most notably Colonel [Cyril Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Black "Cyril Black"), Colonel Pierce C.

David Hogarth credited [Gertrude Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Bell "Gertrude Bell") for much of the success of the Arab Revolt.

Bell had met Sheikh Harb of the [Howeitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howeitat "Howeitat") in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a "mass of information" which was crucial to the success of [Lawrence's occupation of Aqaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aqaba "Battle of Aqaba") covering the "tribal elements ranging between the [Hejaz Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz_railway "Hejaz railway") and the [Nefud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Nafud "An Nafud"), particularly about the Howeitat group."

This tied up more Ottoman troops, who were forced to protect the railway and repair the constant damage.<sup id="cite_ref-TE_47-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-TE-47">[45]</a></sup>

On 1 December 1916, Fakhri Pasha began an offensive with three brigades out of [Medina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina "Medina") with the aim of taking the port of [Yanbu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanbu "Yanbu").<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_36_45-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_36-45">[43]</a></sup> At first, Fakhri's troops defeated the Hashemite forces in several engagements, and seemed set to take Yanbu.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_37_48-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_37-48">[46]</a></sup> It was fire and air support from the five ships of the Royal Navy Red Sea Patrol that defeated the Ottoman attempts to take Yanbu with heavy losses on 11–12 December 1916.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_37_48-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_37-48">[46]</a></sup> Fakhri then turned his forces south to take [Rabegh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabigh "Rabigh"), but owing to the guerrilla attacks on his flanks and supply lines, air attacks from the newly established Royal Flying Corps base at Yanbu, and the over-extension of his supply lines, he was forced to turn back on 18 January 1917, to Medina.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_38_49-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_38-49">[47]</a></sup>

#### Northward expeditions (January–November 1917)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arab_Revolt&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Northward expeditions (January–November 1917)")\]

The [Hejaz railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz_railway "Hejaz railway") (Damascus-Mecca pilgrim route), built at great expense by the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, but quickly fell into disrepair after the Arab revolt of 1917.

The year 1917 began well for the Hashemites when the Emir Abdullah and his Arab Eastern Army ambushed an Ottoman convoy led by Ashraf Bey in the desert, and captured £20,000 worth of gold coins that were intended to bribe the [Bedouin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin "Bedouin") into loyalty to the [Sultan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sultans_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire").<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-54">[52]</a></sup> Starting in early 1917, the Hashemite guerrillas began attacking the Hejaz railway.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_pages_39-43_55-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_pages_39-43-55">[53]</a></sup> At first, guerrilla forces commanded by officers from the Regular Army such as al-Misri, and by British officers such as Newcombe, Lieutenant Hornby and Major [Herbert Garland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Garland "Herbert Garland") focused their efforts on blowing up unguarded sections of the Hejaz railway.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_pages_39-43_55-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_pages_39-43-55">[53]</a></sup> Garland was the inventor of the so-called "Garland mine", which was used with much destructive force on the Hejaz railway.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_43_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_43-56">[54]</a></sup> In February 1917, Garland succeeded for the first time in destroying a moving locomotive with a mine of his own design.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_43_56-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_43-56">[54]</a></sup> Around [Medina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina "Medina"), Captain Muhammad Ould Ali Raho of the French Military Mission carried out his first railway demolition attack in February 1917.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_pages_43-44_57-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_pages_43-44-57">[55]</a></sup> Captain Raho was to emerge as one of the leading destroyers of the Hejaz railway.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_pages_43-44_57-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_pages_43-44-57">[55]</a></sup> In March 1917, Lawrence led his first attack on the Hejaz railway.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_44_58-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_44-58">[56]</a></sup> Typical of such attacks were the one commanded out by Newcombe and Joyce who on the night of 6/7 July 1917 when they had planted over 500 charges on the Hejaz railway, which all went off at about 2 am.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_44_58-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_44-58">[56]</a></sup> In a raid in August 1917, Captain Raho led a force of Bedouin in destroying 5 kilometers of the Hejaz railway and four bridges.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-59">[57]</a></sup>

In March 1917, an Ottoman force joined by tribesmen from [Jabal Shammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabal_Shammar "Jabal Shammar") led by [Ibn Rashid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Rashid "Ibn Rashid") carried out a sweep of the Hejaz that did much damage to the Hashemite forces.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_38_49-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_38-49">[47]</a></sup> However, the Ottoman failure to take [Yanbu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanbu "Yanbu") in December 1916 led to the increased strengthening of the Hashemite forces, and led to the Ottoman forces to assume the defensive.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_38_49-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_38-49">[47]</a></sup> Lawrence was later to claim that the failure of the offensive against Yanbu was the turning point that ensured the ultimate defeat of the Ottomans in the [Hejaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz "Hejaz").<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_37_48-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_37-48">[46]</a></sup>

In 1917, Lawrence arranged a joint action with the Arab irregulars and forces under [Auda Abu Tayi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auda_Abu_Tayi "Auda Abu Tayi") (until then in the employ of the Ottomans) against the port city of [Aqaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqaba "Aqaba"). This is now known as the [Battle of Aqaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aqaba "Battle of Aqaba"). Aqaba was the only remaining Ottoman port on the [Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea") and threatened the right flank of [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland")'s [Egyptian Expeditionary Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Expeditionary_Force "Egyptian Expeditionary Force") defending [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Egypt "Sultanate of Egypt") and preparing to advance into [Sanjak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak "Sanjak") Maan of the [Syria Vilayet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_Vilayet "Syria Vilayet").<sup id="cite_ref-p81_52-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-p81-52">[50]</a></sup> Capture of Aqaba would aid transfer of British supplies to the Arab revolt.<sup id="cite_ref-p82_60-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-p82-60">[58]</a></sup> Lawrence and Auda left Wedj on 9 May 1917 with a party of 40 men to recruit a mobile force from the [Howeitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howeitat "Howeitat"), a tribe located in the area. On 6 July, after an overland attack, [Aqaba fell to those Arab forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Aqaba "Battle of Aqaba") with only a handful of casualties.<sup id="cite_ref-p82_60-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-p82-60">[58]</a></sup> Lawrence then rode 150 miles to [Suez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez "Suez") to arrange Royal Navy delivery of food and supplies for the 2,500 Arabs and 700 Ottoman prisoners in Aqaba; soon the city was co-occupied by a large Anglo-French flotilla (including warships and sea planes), which helped the Arabs secure their hold on Aqaba.<sup id="cite_ref-p82_60-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-p82-60">[58]</a></sup> Even as the Hashemite armies advanced, they still encountered sometimes fierce opposition from local residents. In July 1917, residents of the town of Karak fought against the Hashemite forces and turned them back. Later in the year British intelligence reports suggested that most of the tribes in the region east of the [Jordan River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River "Jordan River") were "firmly in the Ottoman camp."<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-61">[59]</a></sup> The tribes feared repressions and losing the money they had received from the Ottomans for their loyalty.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-62">[60]</a></sup> Later in the year, the Hashemite warriors made a series of small raids on Ottoman positions in support of [British General Allenby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Allenby "Edmund Allenby")'s winter attack on the [Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip")–[Bersheeba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beersheba "Beersheba") defensive line, which led to the [Battle of Beersheba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Beersheba_(1917) "Battle of Beersheba (1917)").<sup id="cite_ref-p83_63-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-p83-63">[61]</a></sup> Typical of such raids was one led by Lawrence in September 1917 that saw Lawrence destroy a Turkish rail convoy by blowing up the bridge it was crossing at [Mudawwara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudawwara "Mudawwara") and then ambushing the Turkish repair party.<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-64">[62]</a></sup> In November 1917, as aid to Allenby's offensive, Lawrence launched a deep-raiding party into the [Yarmouk River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarmouk_River "Yarmouk River") valley, which failed to destroy the railway bridge at [Tel ash-Shehab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_Shihab "Tell Shihab"), but which succeeded in ambushing and destroying the train of General Mehmed Cemal Pasha, the commander of the Ottoman VII Corps.<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-65">[63]</a></sup> Allenby's victories led directly to the British capture of [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") just before Christmas 1917.

By the time of [Aqaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqaba "Aqaba")'s capture, many other officers joined Faisal's campaign. A large number of British officers and advisors, led by Lt. Col.s [Stewart F. Newcombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.F._Newcombe "S.F. Newcombe") and Cyril E. Wilson, arrived to provide the Arabs rifles, explosives, mortars, and machine guns.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_59_66-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_59-66">[64]</a></sup> Artillery was only sporadically supplied due to a general shortage, though Faisal would have several batteries of mountain guns under French Captain Pisani and his Algerians for the Megiddo Campaign.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_59_66-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_59-66">[64]</a></sup> Egyptian and Indian troops also served with the Revolt, primarily as machine gunners and specialist troops, a number of [armoured cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Armoured_Car "Rolls-Royce Armoured Car") were allocated for use.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_59_66-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_59-66">[64]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-67">[65]</a></sup> The [Royal Flying Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Corps "Royal Flying Corps") often supported the Arab operations, and the [Imperial Camel Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Camel_Corps "Imperial Camel Corps") served with the Arabs for a time.<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-68">[66]</a></sup> The French military mission of 1,100 officers under Brémond established good relations with Hussein and especially with his sons, the Emirs [Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_of_Hejaz "Ali of Hejaz") and [Abdullah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_I_of_Jordan "Abdullah I of Jordan"), and for this reason, most of the French effort went into assisting the Arab Southern Army commanded by the Emir Ali that was laying [siege to Medina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Medina "Siege of Medina") and the Eastern Army commanded by Abdullah that had the responsibility of protecting Ali's eastern flank from Ibn Rashid.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_17_42-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_17-42">[40]</a></sup> Medina was never taken by the Hashemite forces, and the Ottoman commander, Fakhri Pasha, only surrendered [Medina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina "Medina") when ordered to by the [Turkish government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Turkey "Government of Turkey") on 9 January 1919.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_81_69-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_81-69">[67]</a></sup> The total number of Ottoman troops bottled up in Medina by the time of the surrender were 456 officers and 9364 soldiers.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_page_81_69-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_page_81-69">[67]</a></sup>

Under the direction of Lawrence, Wilson, and other officers, the Arabs launched a highly successful campaign against the Hejaz railway, capturing military supplies, destroying trains and tracks, and tying down thousands of Ottoman troops.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-70">[68]</a></sup> Though the attacks were mixed in success, they achieved their primary goal of tying down Ottoman troops and cutting off Medina. In January 1918, in one of the largest set-piece battles of the Revolt, Arab forces (including Lawrence) defeated a large Ottoman force at the [Battle of Tafilah](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tafilah&action=edit&redlink=1 "Battle of Tafilah (page does not exist)"), inflicting over 1,000 Ottoman casualties for the loss of a mere forty men.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-71">[69]</a></sup>

In the spring of 1918, Operation Hedgehog, a concerted attempt to sever and destroy the Hejaz railway, was launched.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-75">[73]</a></sup> In May 1918, Hedgehog led to the destruction of 25 bridges of the Hejaz railway.<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-76">[74]</a></sup> On 11 May Arab regulars captured Jerdun and 140 prisoners.

In 1918, the Arab cavalry gained in strength (as it seemed victory was at hand) and they were able to provide Allenby's army with intelligence on Ottoman army positions. They also harassed Ottoman supply columns, attacked small garrisons, and destroyed railway tracks. A major victory occurred on 27 September when an entire brigade of Ottoman, Austrian and German troops, retreating from [Mezerib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzayrib "Muzayrib"), was virtually wiped out in a battle with Arab forces near the village of [Tafas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafas "Tafas") (which the Turks had plundered during their retreat).<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_pages_76-77_82-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_pages_76-77-82">[80]</a></sup> This led to the so-called [Tafas massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafas_massacre "Tafas massacre"), in which Lawrence claimed in a letter to his brother to have issued a "no-prisoners" order, maintaining after the war that massacre was in retaliation for the earlier Ottoman massacre of the village of Tafas, and that he had at least 250 German and Austrian POWs together with an uncounted number of Turks lined up to be summarily shot.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy,_David_pages_76-77_82-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-Murphy,_David_pages_76-77-82">[80]</a></sup> Lawrence later wrote in _[Seven Pillars of Wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Pillars_of_Wisdom "Seven Pillars of Wisdom")_ that "In a madness born of the horror of Tafas we killed and killed, even blowing in the heads of the fallen and of the animals; as though their death and running blood could slake our agony."<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-83">[81]</a></sup> In part due to these attacks, Allenby's last offensive, the [Battle of Megiddo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Megiddo_(1918) "Battle of Megiddo (1918)"), was a stunning success.<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-84">[82]</a></sup> By late September and October 1918, an increasingly demoralized Ottoman Army began to retreat and surrender whenever possible to British troops.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-85">[83]</a></sup> "Sherifial irregulars" accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel T.

The first Arab Revolt forces to reach [Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus") were Sharif Naser's Hashemite camel cavalry and the cavalry of the Ruwallah tribe, led by Nuri Sha'lan, on 30 September 1918. The bulk of these troops remained outside of the city with the intention of awaiting the arrival of Sharif Faisal. However, a small contingent from the group was sent within the walls of the city, where they found the Arab Revolt flag already raised by surviving Arab nationalists among the citizenry. Later that day [Australian Light Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Light_Horse#World_War_1 "Australian Light Horse") troops marched into Damascus. Auda Abu Ta'yi, T. E. Lawrence and Arab troops rode into Damascus the next day, 1 October. At the end of the war, the [Egyptian Expeditionary Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Expeditionary_Force "Egyptian Expeditionary Force") had seized [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)"), [Transjordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transjordan_(region) "Transjordan (region)"), [Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon "Lebanon"), large parts of the [Arabian peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula "Arabian Peninsula") and [southern Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Syria "Southern Syria"). Medina, cut off from the rest of the Ottoman Empire, would not surrender until January 1919.<sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-88">[86]</a></sup>

The region by the end of the war

The [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland") agreed in the [McMahon–Hussein Correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence "McMahon–Hussein Correspondence") that it would support Arab independence if they revolted against the Ottomans.

However, the United Kingdom and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic") reneged on the original deal and divided up the area under the [1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement "Sykes–Picot Agreement") in ways that the Arabs felt were unfavourable to them. Further confusing the issue was the [Balfour Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration "Balfour Declaration") of 1917, which promised support for a [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews") "national home" in [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)"). This series of events is often characterised as a betrayal of the Arabs by the British.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-89">[87]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-90">[88]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-91">[89]</a></sup> For a brief period, the [Hejaz region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz "Hejaz") of western [Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula "Arabian Peninsula") became a [self-declared state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-declared_states "Self-declared states"), without being universally recognised as such, under Hussein's control. Although both [Ibn Saud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud "Ibn Saud") and Hussein both received British aid, it was eventually conquered by [Ibn Saud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud "Ibn Saud") in 1925, as part of his military and sociopolitical campaign for the [unification of Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Saudi_Arabia "Unification of Saudi Arabia").<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-92">[90]</a></sup>

The Arab Revolt is seen by historians as the first organized movement of [Arab nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism "Arab nationalism"). It brought together different Arab groups for the first time with the common goal to fight for independence from the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"). Much of the history of Arab independence stemmed from the revolt beginning with the kingdom that had been founded by Hussein.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

After the war, the Arab Revolt had implications. Groups of people were put into classes that were based on whether they had fought in the revolt and their rank. In [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq"), a group of Sharifian officers from the Arab Revolt formed a political party that they headed. The Hashemites in [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan") remain influenced by the actions of the revolt's Arab leaders.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKhalidi19917_93-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKhalidi19917-93">[91]</a></sup>

## Underlying causes\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arab_Revolt&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Underlying causes")\]

### Hussein\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arab_Revolt&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Hussein")\]

According to [Efraim Karsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efraim_Karsh "Efraim Karsh") of [Bar-Ilan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-Ilan_University "Bar-Ilan University"), [Sharif Hussein of Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_bin_Ali,_Sharif_of_Mecca "Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca") was "a man with grandiose ambitions" who had first started to fall out with his masters in Istanbul when the dictatorship, a triumvirate known as the [Three Pashas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Pashas "Three Pashas") (General [Enver Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Pasha "Enver Pasha"), [Talaat Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talaat_Pasha "Talaat Pasha"), and [Cemal Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemal_Pasha "Cemal Pasha")), which represented the radical [Turkish nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_nationalism "Turkish nationalism") wing of the [CUP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Union_and_Progress "Committee of Union and Progress"), seized power in a coup d'état in January 1913 and began to pursue a policy of [Turkification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkification "Turkification"), which gradually angered non-Turkish subjects.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-94">[92]</a></sup> Hussein started to embrace the language of [Arab nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism "Arab nationalism") only after the [Young Turks revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turk_Revolution "Young Turk Revolution") against the Ottoman sultan [Abdul Hamid II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hamid_II "Abdul Hamid II") in July 1908.<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-95">[93]</a></sup> The fighting force of the revolt was mostly combined from Ottoman defectors and Arabian tribes loyal to the Sharif.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_96-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-:1-96">[94]</a></sup>

### Religious justification\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arab_Revolt&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Religious justification")\]

Though the Sharifian revolt has tended to be regarded as a revolt rooted in a secular Arab nationalist sentiment,<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> the Sharif did not present it in those terms. Rather, he accused the [Young Turks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turks "Young Turks") of violating the sacred tenets of [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam") by pursuing the policy of [Turkification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkification "Turkification") and discriminating against its non-Turkish population and called [Arab Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Muslims "Arab Muslims") to sacred rebellion against the Ottoman government.<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-97">[95]</a></sup> The Turks answered by accusing the rebelling tribes of betraying the Muslim [Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Caliphate "Ottoman Caliphate") during a campaign against imperialist powers attempting to divide and govern Muslim lands.<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-98">[96]</a></sup> The Turks said the revolting Arabs gained nothing after the revolt; rather, the Middle East was carved up by the British and French.

### Ethnic tensions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arab_Revolt&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Ethnic tensions")\]

While the revolt failed to garner significant support from within the Ottoman Empire's soon-to-be Iraq provinces, it did find huge support from Arab populated Levantine provinces.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_96-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-:1-96">[94]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability"><span title="The referenced citation does not contain this info. (January 2023)">irrelevant citation</span></a></i>]</sup> This early [Arab nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism "Arab nationalism") came about when the majority of the Arabs living in the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") were loyal primarily to their own families, clans, and tribes<sup id="cite_ref-:0_99-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-:0-99">[97]</a></sup> despite efforts of the Turkish ruling class, who pursued a policy of [Turkification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkification "Turkification") through the [Tanzimat reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzimat_reforms "Tanzimat reforms") and hoped to create a feeling of "[Ottomanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottomanism "Ottomanism")" among the different ethnicities under the [Ottoman domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"). Liberal reforms brought about by the Tanzimat also transformed the [Ottoman Caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Caliphate "Ottoman Caliphate") into a secular empire, which weakened the Islamic concept of [Ummah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah "Ummah") that tied the different races together.<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-100">[98]</a></sup> The arrival of [Committee of Union and Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Union_and_Progress "Committee of Union and Progress") to power and the creation of a [one-party state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state "One-party state") in 1913 which mandated [Turkish nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_nationalism "Turkish nationalism") as a state ideology worsened the relationship between the Ottoman state and its non-Turkish subjects.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_99-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt#cite_note-:0-99">[97]</a></sup>
