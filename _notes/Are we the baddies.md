	It seems like a pretty big stretch to name "global peace" (which wasn't global but more like peace in Europe) after America. I'd argue that the formation of the EU (starting with the treaty of Brussels in 1948) has really stabilised Europe. The US has since helped keep Europe stable (at least in part), yes. But they waged wars in other parts of the earth, and some of the consequences of that now destabilise Europe through migrant waves and a corresponding reactionary shift in our politics. (Just to be sure: The migrants are not at fault here, their presence is merely a catalyst for underlying issues to surface) Many countriies outside of Europe are either not seeing much more stable conditions than they did before the PA, or are seeing the for other reasons (is the peace within China due to the US for example?)

	Also it's pretty funny that the English Wikipedia page has no critizism of the PA, only a very soft section on US imperialism that ends with saying that it isn't really imperialism. Seems like a lot of careful narrative went into that. The German page (I speak German so I compared only that) is a lot more critical. It also mentions the Pax Sovietana in the beginning, which is conveniently absent from the English page. For anyone interested, here's the Google Translate version of the German critique page:

	> This attitude is met with great skepticism and resistance in large parts of the world, especially in the socialist or social democratic governed countries of South America, in the Arab world and in the countries of Africa and Asia.  The Pax Americana is seen there as a legitimizing discourse for US neo-colonialism and imperialism.  The concepts of freedom and liberal market economy that emerged in the West within the framework of bourgeois democracy are viewed critically there, especially since these are applied economically in the interests of the US and Europe - for example within the framework of the WTO, which is dominated by the Western industrial nations.

	> The equality of women and men, human rights, the separation of church and state, and the freedom of science are understood and implemented or not implemented differently in different countries.  The West's discourse of seeing itself as the most developed is being critically questioned by scientists.  What some people see as the inadequate implementation of the values ​​propagated by the USA in their own country makes the global propagation of these values ​​by the USA unbelievable for many people.

	> Especially in the “Third World” but also in Western societies, not all people agree with the perceived Americanization of the world: with the dominance of American culture, the preference for self-interest and the associated decline in social solidarity, the focus on happiness in this world  in the world according to the utilitarianism of the Pursuit of Happiness and the American Way of Life.  This draft of a global social and peace order based on materialism and power politics is also met with strong reservations in the Christian churches, at least outside the USA, most prominently in the Catholic church.  Proponents, on the other hand, attribute such appeal to Pax Americana that they consider it to be the only conceivable and realistic future New World Order.

	> In October 2013, in a commentary published by the Chinese news agency Xinhua on the occasion of budget disputes in the USA, the Chinese journalist Liu Chang criticized the fact that the USA claims to be recognized as a moral role model, although at the same time it tortures prisoners and civilians using drones  kill and spy on world leaders.  He continued that the promises of Pax Americana, such as the United States helping to end violence and conflict, addressing poverty and displacement, and working toward real and lasting peace, have not been fulfilled.  Instead, the United States acted selfishly and abused its power to wreak havoc on the world, shift financial risks abroad, inflame regional tensions and territorial conflicts, and wage illicit wars based on blatant lies.  As a result, the world is still searching for a way out of the economic catastrophe wrought by the insatiable elites of Wall Street.

	Remember: You are not immune to propaganda. The English version is the one most likely to be read by Americans. Go read it, you will not find this harsh of a critique there. The German version is written from the outside about America, but from an allied perspective. We profit off US dominance, and still this is what German Wikipedia thinks is necessary to mention. I have no idea what other nations such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, or Bolivia might have to say about this "era of unprecedented peace".

		\> It seems like a pretty big stretch to name "global peace" (which wasn't global but more like peace in Europe) after America.
		
		Not really, that's what it's called.
		
		And considering it's the most peaceful time in history globally, and that includes the global south, it seems quite fair to call it peace.
		
		\> I'd argue that the formation of the EU (starting with the treaty of Brussels in 1948) has really stabilised Europe.
		
		People have made these arguments in professional settings before, they always fall apart when you really start looking at it.    
		The EU has helped formalize the European structure slightly, but the whole thing would never have gotten off the ground at all if it weren't for the simple fact that everyone involved was US aligned to begin with as a result of the formation of NATO and true US geopolitical domination after ww2.     
		The US focused particularly on Europe and the need for a strong and \*allied\* europe after ww2.
		
		\> Pax Sovietana 
		
		Pax Sovietica.  
		And no one takes that one seriously, it's just a remnant of soviet academia which makes sense that it's included in the german one on account of the DDR.
		
		The 3 that are recognized are the Pax Romana, Pax Britannica, and Pax Americana.    
		There are arguments for other ones like Pax Sinica, Incaica, Ottomana, etc.     
		But Britannica and Americana are the only ones that could be considered reasonably global spanning, with Romana getting thrown in since that's what they're all named after. 
		
		\> But they waged wars in other parts of the earth, and some of the consequences of that now destabilise Europe through migrant waves and a corresponding reactionary shift in our politics
		
		There is a ton of assumptions here that are wrong and lacking in context.
		
		\-Waging wars does preclude being generally peaceful. In a geopolitical context refusing to participate in wars doesn't mean wars don't happen, it just tends to mean the side that you would want to win, doesn't.
		
		\-You're saying the refugees are destabilizing europe (true), but you're alsoassuming those refugees are only happening because of wars that are only happening because the US are involved.     
		But wars are always happening, conflicts are always happening, and there quite simply are a lot of migration happening into Europe because there's more people than there ever has been before, people in those areas know it's an option now, and it's feasible to actually get there.
		
		And it's highly doubtful that the middle east would be particularly peaceful without US involvement, the place has been mired in turmoil since the Ottoman empire fell apart.     
		Which is somewhat inevitable, that's what happens when a Pax breaks down, the entity keeping a lid on the issues and shutting down problems (generally with a hefty helping of violence) breaks down, and with the ending of the Pax Ottomana everyone broke into their tribal groups and shit went terribly south.     
		There was largely no way that was going to go any other way, other than some other similar entity taking up the mantle and no one wanted to because it coincides with the breakdown of colonial structure. 
		
		The increase in refugees has been constant because there are regions that are more violent than others and the global population keeps increasing, but the world was at its most peaceful in all of history a few years ago even in the more unstable areas, it's only the last few years that have seen an increase.     
		And that increase in conflict is directly correlated with America being less willing to use violence and war.     
		Which seems contradictory on the face of it, but there's a reason why people were calling the US the global police.    
		Because for the last few decades they functionally have been.     
		And the police are, fundamentally, a violent institution who does violence on behalf of the collective, against threats to the collective, with the intent of keeping society in running order.
		
		\> Also it's pretty funny that the English Wikipedia page has no critizism of the PA, only a very soft section on US imperialism that ends with saying that it isn't really imperialism. 
		
		Okay if you say so, I haven't read it.
		
		\> Remember: You are not immune to propaganda. 
		
		Neither are you.  
		
		\> The English version is the one most likely to be read by Americans. Go read it, you will not find this harsh of a critique there. The German version is written from the outside about America, but from an allied perspective.
		
		I'm not American and I can read the german too (I'm not german either though).
		
		Also, tone down the "you could learn by reading more Wikipedia articles" mate.      
		What is either Wikipedia article going to tell me that I didn't hear about when I got my degree in the history of superpower geopolitics?
