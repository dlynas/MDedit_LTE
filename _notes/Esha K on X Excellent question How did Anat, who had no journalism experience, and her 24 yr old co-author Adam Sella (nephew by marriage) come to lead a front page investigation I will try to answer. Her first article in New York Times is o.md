Excellent question: How did Anat, who had no journalism experience, and her 24 yr old co-author Adam Sella (nephew by marriage) come to lead a front page investigation? I will try to answer. Her first article in New York Times is on Nov 14, 2023.

Replying to @LailaAlarian @RBrulin and @nytimes

The “Screams Without Words” @nytimes article coauthored by Anat Schwartz about mass rape has been systematically debunked by many. How did Anat, who had no journalism experience, and her 24 yr old co-author Adam Sella (nephew by marriage) come to lead a front page investigation?

In 2017, she directed a documentary that was originally titled "Dream: Israel" but changed to "La Promise"

Now let's get to her co-author, who also didn't write beforehand Oct 2023...
