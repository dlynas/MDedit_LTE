## Accurate, detailed, recently published books about Rojava?

> Their development, philosophical foundations, descriptions of how they organize/what their communities look like, their military history, etc.
> 
> Something that would really give me a sense of how they function, what they do and how they do it; what factors contributed to its formation, how does it sustain itself, what problems does it face? My primary concern lately is to read about how workers' councils, revolutions, etc work so that I can understand how radicalism actually works and how it looks in life, rather than the purely theoretical stuff.

	Dog Section Press and the Internationalist Commune of Rojava recently had a [fundraising campaign to publish a run of *Make Rojava Green Again*](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/make-rojava-green-again/?), though I don't think that it's available for purchase just yet. Debbie Bookchin characterizes it as follows: 

	> *In language that bridges the Utopian and the concrete, the poetic and the everyday, the Internationalist Commune of Rojava has produced both a vision and a manual for what a free, ecological society can look like. In these pages you will find a philosophical introduction to the idea of social ecology, a theory that argues that only when we end the hierarchical relations between human beings (men over women, young over old, one ethnicity or religion over another, etc.) will we be able to heal our relationship with the natural world.* 

	This is the only English language publication by and about revolutionaries in Rojava that I'm aware of off the top of my head. There is also [*Revolution in Rojava*](https://www.akpress.org/revolutioninrojava.html) which was written by academics who I believe were eyewitnesses of the revolution.

	* üü® **[InternationalRojava](https://www.reddit.com/user/InternationalRojava)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2019-02-12 11:14:02)_

		The book is now already available in English, Italian and German.
		
		Here are the different links to get the book: makerojavagreenagain.org/book

	*[Rojava: Revolution, War and the Future of Syria's Kurds](https://www.akpress.org/rojava.html)* by [Thomas Schmidinger](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/thomas.schmidinger/php/english.php), published June 2018.

	Schmidinger is a political scientist, as well as a cultural anthropologist. Here is the description from the linked AK Press website: 

	> The Kurdish territory of Rojava in Syria has become a watchword for radical democracy, communalism and gender equality. But while Western radicals continue to project their own values onto the revolution, the complexities of the situation are often overlooked or misunderstood.

	> Based on over seventeen years of research and fieldwork, Thomas Schmidinger provides a detailed introduction to the history and political situation in Rojava. Outlining the history of the Kurds in Syria from the late Ottoman Empire until the Syrian civil war, he describes the developments in Rojava since 2011: the protests against the regime, the establishment of a Kurdish para-state, the conflicts between the parties about the administration of the Kurdish territory and how the PYD and its People‚Äôs Councils rule the territory.

	> The book draws on interviews with political leaders of different parties, civil society activists, artists, fighters and religious leaders in order to paint an complex picture of the historical conflict and the contemporary situation.

	That said, it may not be the best for what you specifically want, which is more instructive and lead-by-example stuff. 

	>  My primary concern lately is to read about how workers' councils, revolutions, etc work so that I can understand how radicalism actually works and how it looks in life, rather than the purely theoretical stuff.

	I highly suggest David Graeber's *Direct Action: An Ethnography*. The book is explicitly meant to serve as a way to *show* people what direct democracy looks like, how it works in practice, etc. Anarchist groups often work in secrecy, so Graeber realized as a consequence the public is never exposed to what organizing looks like.

		it actually sounds at least partially llike what i'm lookin for. especially the historical aspect, im rly interested in what kind of circumstances allow for the space and (shift in? liberation of? lol) subjectivity that makes largescale revolutionary movements possible (for example: why russia in 1917, why spain in 1936- what was the background that made this shit possible)
		
		and i actually read 'direct action' like a year ago, it's on my reread list.
		
		thanks, though! i'm definitely putting 'rojava' on my to-buy list. especially where it acknowledges how easy it is for ppl so far away from the movement to project themselves onto it and totally misread it. that's why i made this post, subcommandante marcos said that's a big problem with a lot of the books written about the zapatistas.

			> i'm definitely putting 'rojava' on my to-buy list. 
			
			It's 25% off on AK Press's website right now because it's a new release. If you can't buy it now, I highly suggest still purchasing it from AK Press to support them (as opposed to buying from Amazon, etc.). 
			
			> why russia in 1917, why spain in 1936- what was the background that made this shit possible
			
			It's hard to figure out exactly why - but I think there is a huge amount of literature on both topics. I guess Rojava being relatively contemporary, there is not a lot of back-wards looking analysis done yet to know precisely. I think there isn't even a clear picture of exactly what life is like in Rojava and whether it's really as practical or effective as is claimed (and the same is true for the Zapatistas - who have run into issues such as conflict with *other native Mayans* in the region of rainforests, as well as conflicts with international environmentalists). 
			
			Anyway - glad you're staying curious, and I hope you find what you are looking for.

				i love ak, the only issue is i run into shipping prices of 30+ bucks lolol they're 100% my go to when i have the cash, tho. they honestly sell amazingly made books lol nice covers and shit 
				
				and i'd say it's probably impossible to get a true concrete sense of the 'why' but it's still a worthwhile thing to do. i'm mostly concerned with contributing to the on-the-ground conditions that make this kind of stuff possible, so seeing what kind of organizations existed in paris leading up to the commune that allowed them to take advantage of the french state's vulnerability after the franco-prussian war, and that kinda stuff.
				
				also, i dunno how interested in this you are, but while i have ya here 'october' by china mieville is a pretty interesting account of the russian revolution from february to october 1917. and i haven't read it yet, but 'jackson rising' by kali akuno is about a group in jackson currently building resistance to capitalism in jackson, mississipi. no idea if yr interested, just figure i'd toss those out there lol i tend to agree with the emphasis the situationists put on studying past and present movements/revolutions, as you can see lolol
				
				anyway lol thanks for the suggestions/responses, much appreciated!

	Small Key Can Open A Large Door: the Rojava Revolution (https://www.akpress.org/a-small-key-can-open-a-large-door.html)

		Note: please support small and independent publishers like AK Press. Sometimes you can find the books cheaper from them, but even if slightly more expensive, it helps keep alive independent printing in an age where there is increasing consolidation of power in publishing.
