## Honestly I can’t look at myself in the mirror and I haven’t been able to for a while now. I can’t truthfully say that I’m doing the absolute most I can be doing right now to dedicate myself to the struggle and that’s the s**t I need to work on. Don’t we all need to be asking ourselves these uncomfortable questions everyday that we get a crumb of “ease” that came at the expense of someone else’s oppression? How can we possibly be arrogant enough to think that we can simply think about ourselves when so many in our communities and across oceans are being massacred by capitalist/ colonial systems this very second? How can looking away & selfishly thinking just about ourselves be a recipe for happiness? It sounds depraved just when I say it out loud. 

And I was born into poverty & still have no intergenerational wealth but have more than I did yesterday. And that more has not given me the freedom that I thought it would. And despite pushing myself to dedicate my life to this struggle, I’m still stuck & struggling to let go of things that I can let go off to be even more committed to this fight. I thought leaving my community behind, looking away from their pain, working hard to secure my own resources would help me— it’s just killing me slowly. The guilt I feel is justified, it’s a mirror. I can do more. I should be closer to my people, not these ivory towers I’m stuck struggling in. So truly I don’t know how people who have access to more resources, more privilege, have less boulders on their back… are deluding themselves into thinking they can’t do more? 

Deep down inside we all know the cop/ capitalist/ colonizer in our heads that needs to be reckoned with. Do it. People are dying. Do it. Your soul is dying. Do it. The land is dying. Do it. And also the people & the land are fighting back, resisting, miserably & joyfully, and we cannot experience any of that unrelenting faith, purpose, meaning & collectivism if we cannot work towards being closer to the MOST marginalized and furthest from the colonizers/ oppressors. Materially, in our values, in how we show up in the world, in every way. Aspiring to conform & assimilate will not save us. It will kill us slowly.
