## CMV: The progress of AI necessitates a shift from Capitalism

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1borhg2/cmv_the_progress_of_ai_necessitates_a_shift_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1borhg2/cmv_the_progress_of_ai_necessitates_a_shift_from/)

> Al makes production of goods and services monumentally more productive. We can make a shit ton more of goods and services, efficiency becomes mad. And with this technological advancement, society should advance as well right, with more resources at our disposal due to automation we should be better off as a society. But no, Capitalism screws us. As industries get automated, there'll be massive job crises, people will be unemployed and unable to afford some basic needs. And as more companies use automation, the need for labor decreases and decreases, as it's way more profitable to just use automation. Everyone's just going to end up unemployed with just capital owners getting richer and richer, as they employ automation more and more. Something like automation is supposed to be good for society, it makes work easier, but it just ends up increasing the wealth gap.
> 
> Now solutions to this, a UBI? Eh, that just weakens the problem a little bit with workers having a better ability to afford basic needs, but the rich would still continually get richer, as a UBI is in no way going to give the average person enough money to be able to raise capital to start a competitive business that employs Al. Unless that UBI is like a massive amount of money but that just seems super ineffective and would probably just end up causing inflation as well.
> 
> Welfare, probably would work to the same level of UBI, would provide basic needs to the unemployed, probably a bit more efficiently in terms of the people more in need get what they need, but still the same problem, no one has the ability to raise capital still other than preexisting capital owners.
> 
> Therefore, I think we really, really need to make a shift towards socialism, or at least somewhere in which automation can benefit the many, rather than the rich few. Now you can say, socialism has never worked, but let's be real, socialism has failed because of geopolitical reasons, and authoritarianism, not because socialism is fundamentally flawed. And with automation, most low-skill and some high skill labor will become redundant, so it's not even like you can use the argument that people will become lazy and it won't work, because it won't matter if they're lazy.
> Now are these statements very broad, and general, and am I making a billion assumptions about the optics, yes. But I don't think there's any denying that a trend like this is going to occur, maybe not linearly as I portray it, but it will happen. Very open to disagreement, lmk what yall think.
> 
> Note: This is from my personal notes that I wrote when I was in high school so I apologize if anywhere my tone isn’t open minded or is matter of fact.

	Let's be honest here: the average person could not start a competitive business, even if they had the capital. It takes a lot of skills that the average person simply doesn't possess. "Capital" is just the most visibly lacking thing. 

	"Oh, but AI can fill the skill gap for them"

	If those skills are available in an AI "business-in-a-box" app, then the person still isn't needed. Their very right to use the app (rather than the app running as one of millions on a server farm controlled by a trillion-dollar corporation) is effectively a form of UBI.

		It's not that they possess the skills is that it's not really possible in people's level of expertise because those industries have been allowed to condense power for too long and force people to work in industries where there is no possibility to create a successful business. For example, if you have worked in retail for 30 years and need everything about management retail, you still probably won't be able to compete with Amazon and Walmart.

	Capitalism isn't working anymore, regardless of advances in AI. Pollution of air, water and land. Climate change. Food security. Literal islands of plastic. Landfills. Child labor. Modern slavery. Planned obsolescence. Decline in life expectancy. Pandemics. It has been broken for a long time, exponential growth is fundamentally unsustainable. AI will accelerate the social and economical failure sure, but the environment has failed for a very long time. Multiple dimensions at work. Imperialism and nuclear war are greater motives to end it.

	There's no shortage of items on the list for why capitalism must end, it must happen regardless of AI. Will AI be a short term catalyst for unifying the working class in the class war? Maybe, but capitalism must end regardless.

				>Controlled markets lead to monopolies, not free markets.
				
				Free markets inherently lead to monopolies.  It's a simple reality.  Internet commerce was mostly unregulated and Amazon controls more than half of all internet sales.  It's not because the government rigged the market in their favor. They became the biggest internet retailer and kept improving their service until nobody could compete.
				
				Your analysis of capitalism makes no sense. The entire reason why there is anti trust laws is because of unregulated free markets. Companies were allowed own all the houses in the town, the business, the stores, everything. They had to stop that....by regulating capitalism

							No that’s false, because winning in a market or industry is not a global win over everyone else, it’s simply market or industry leadership.  What you described has never happened. The US economy has never been more monopolistic and the economy has never been more controlled.  The proof literally disagrees with everything you say.  The implication that you’re making is it’s not a monopoly when government controls everything.  That’s the purest definition of monopoly

										there were two global players during the time of standard oil's monopoly.  standard oil in the US and royal dutch shell in russia, indonesia and romania.  royal dutch shell was an amalgamation of several companies that essentially shared profits to compete with the dominance of standard oil.  had standard oil not been forced to break up during the progressive era in the US, it or royal dutch shell would've been the first to discover the persian gulf oil fields and destroy the other.  instead, the british government intervened and started the anglo-persian oil company, which became BP, and standard oil of california, which became chevron, (with help from texaco, what became exxon and what became mobil, all former standard oil subsidiaries) discovered oil in saudi arabia and founded arabian american oil co, which became aramco, which then became saudi-aramco, the state-owned saudi oil company.    
										
										
										the politics of the era got in the way; national governments prevented global monopolies.    
										
										
										which is my whole point.  governments intervene to prevent total monopoly, as monopolies accelerate capitalism's inherent contradictions and destabilize the system.  today, what exists are oligopolies.  which allow for both the inherent efficiencies of larger corporations through economies of scale and the illusion of competition. but it isn't competitive, not really.  oligopolies only really compete with each other in the realms of advertising and branding.  they only price competitively against small businesses, as that's what competition actually is.  which is why conservatives hate those larger corporations, as they fetishize small businesses.  but small businesses continuing to exist proves that competition is limited.  because if it was unlimited, small business would all be impossible, they would all be priced out.  ironically, the very thing you fetishize as the backbone of american capitalism only exists because of state protection.  and the ruling class knows that, which is why they do it; there isn't a more loyal pro-capitalist voting bloc out there than small business owners.    
										
										
										a socialized economy is not a monopoly.  a monopoly exists to bring profit to its owners.  there are no "owners" in a socialized economy, everything is publicly owned.

				This is an absolute 🤡 take. The government had a price czar that set prices on all a ton of prices on WWII. In the 1950s and 1960s, the top effective tax rate was 91% on the rich. That is to say that after a certain point, the government took 91 cents out of every rich persons dollar and they controlled the economy by creating tax incentives for people who invested in specific areas of the economy.

						This time it is different, though. AI will eventually have the capacity to replace *all* mental tasks humans perform. Coupled with robotics, it has the potential to just replace humans almost outright. This isn't a case of improving the efficiency of a specific task, such as using a car instead of a horse drawn cart to transport goods. This isn't a case of automating a specific task like weaving. 
						
						It's a case where we - as humans - can just be replaced. AI won't create jobs in the long term because AI will ultimately be able to do whatever jobs are created.

	This is a commonly held belief, and for good reason.  People see the hype around AI, the predictions that it will do a hard take off and make humans irrelevant.

	However, there is extensive hard evidence that we aren't THAT close to useful super intelligent AI.  We have huge problems that we have no idea how to address, and our current AI is very bad at solving these exact types of problems.

	- Power consumption/cost

	- Unable to budget compute effectively and "think"

	- Fail to pay proper attention to details for some topics

	- Not traceable/verifiable 

	These are solvable, but really hard since any simple solution injects bias that likely hampers performance.

	People who make your argument also forget/don't realize just how many problems exist and need to be solved.  It's Sooo many!  There is just soooo much to do that people aren't aware of because we just don't have time to take on these problems.  It's too much effort, or we don't know where to start.   AI is very likely to let us continue with a pretty normal looking form of capitalism.  We'll just get to go solve a lot more problems a lot quicker.

	Example problems:  

	- Crappy design of products.  Any product that isn't durable/sustainable or elegant and refined should be fixed using AI.

	- Biology issues.  We can solve death/diseases.

	- Housing.  Houses are built like a pile of twigs, coated in paper and glue.  We can do better.

	- Space Travel.  

	- recycling

	Super intelligence will happen, but probably not until everyone has a personal AI advocate that helps them navigate a fast growing and highly improved world.

		>People see the hype around AI, the predictions that it will do a hard take off and make humans irrelevant.
		
		It doesn't have make humans irrelevant debate enough jobs to ruin millions of lives and destroy our economy.  The issue was never that we would lose all jobs but rather that we would lose too many jobs and our economy would collapse for the same of a few multi-billionares.
		
		This means that people will still be working making and developing energy while our economy is in the process of terminally failing. The energy doesn't have to be affordable for that to happen, it just has to be cheaper than paying workers. 
		 
		We are not far off fully automated cars and delivery drones. That is 4 million jobs between truckers, deliverer, and taxi drivers lost to technology that basically already exists. 
		
		The AI to eliminate most customer service jobs will not take long at all. That's 3 million or so more Jobs. Huge numbers of public sector jobs would then not be viable sense rich people and corporations don't pay as high a tax rate. 
		
		And so on.  The economy will collapse if left unchecked. 
		
		>People who make your argument also forget/don't realize just how many problems exist and need to be solved.  It's Sooo many!  
		
		Yes. There are potholes on my street.  That's a problem I would love fixed.  That does create economy though.  It's a pure luxury and purely an expense. That is to say that the workers get paid but the fixed road will never produce enough economy to account for the cost of fixing the road. In reality there are very few products that will cexpand the economy. People and businesses are constantly looking for solve those problems and ignoring the ones that don't make them money.

			No, I don't.  I think you underestimate how different the world will look as AI becomes wider used and better.  Your model seems to be a "all else being equal" type model which seems like a terrible assumption.
			
			Everything will be different.  It's very possible that we'll need strong social programs to ensure the "little guys" are able to effectively use AI and aren't left in the dust, but what these programs will need to do exactly is really hard to say.  If we do get into a monopoly or similar situation, it will be important to break companies up to encourage competition.  However, again, it's not clear that will happen.   Nothing is clear at this point.  We might see huge diversity and decentralization, not centralization.  We don't know.

	I think you're being overly negative about UBI here, if UBI is enough to meet your basic needs enough for a somewhat comfortable life then that still opens up a lot of opportunities for people. 

	It means any paying job will be on top of your basic needs rather than going towards funding basic needs, which makes saving easier. And while sure you're not going to be able to fund a company the size of Google overnight, Google (along with other now iconic tech companies) were started as tiny operations out of a garage. 

	So you can do your own thing pretty much indefinitely even if it's not successful and still be able to afford to at least live.

	Or you just take a relaxing part time job to top up your UBI and live an easy life. If work has to complete with "do nothing but still live ok" then current low paid high stress service jobs will have to adapt and become either better paid or less stressful.

		It doesn't though. A certain percent of people will lose their jobs to AI. If there is UBI, everybody who still has a job is privledged and then the people with no job on UBI are an underclass who is left out of most things. This causes further loss of jobs and the economy keeps shrinking.
		
		UBI creates new problems if it is a replacement for jobs. There would be an inflation on basic necessities like food and a deflation on the value of many other things. Food companies would know that you have to pay higher wages which would price people out of entertainment options, travel, auto industry, etc. 
		
		>So you can do your own thing pretty much indefinitely even if it's not successful and still be able to afford to at least live.
		
		Except now you have to compete with AI, millions of people are our of work so your labor is worth nothing,  and you committed to capitalism so, Amazon, Walmart, Google, and Apple literally just own everything

		A UBI definitely helps but it doesn't address the core inequalities that AI would cause. Yes a select skilled/talented few would probably be able to use their UBI money to build big companies that employ AI, but those that don't end up just being on UBI not working due to the massive unemployment AI would eventually cause.

	> Eh, that just weakens the problem a little bit with workers having a better ability to afford basic needs, but the rich would still continually get richer,

	This kills your entire point. How can the rich get richer if there is no one to buy their products? IF we get to a point where almost no one is working because of automation and we implement UBI it will be more than enough for basic needs because company owners and government will want the economy to keep rolling.

	> as a UBI is in no way going to give the average person enough money to be able to raise capital to start a competitive business... that employs Al

	Most employees don't have enough money now to start competitive business now, most people start businesses with loans. Business loans are a normal thing now and they will continue because they make money for banks. 

	>  that employs Al

	AI will be cheap by the time this comes around. I have a computer that can do AI images and I didn't spend that much on it (decent gaming PC) and the software was free and open source. This technology will be available to anyone that wants to use it.

	EDIT: Also this is the exact argument we had when computers started being a thing or robots in manufacturing jobs and we haven't needed to move to a totally different economic system because of them so I think we'll be fine at the end of this.

		You've lived through this current inflation. Do you really want to give corporation complete control of your purchasing power? What do you do when every company decides to raise prices on basic living expenses knowing that people still have to pay? 
		
		UBI is not a substitute for having jobs. In that scenario it deflates the value of all nonessential items instantly and none of them will ever get made again. Either the government would have to take over most industries any way. 
		
		Why would anybody want a small number of private owners to own everything if it means they get UBI and it means all the things they do with their free time don't exist anymore? 
		
		How about a just take away that control and give these companies to people directly at that point? Keeping private owners doesn't make sense when they destroyed our standard of living for short term profits.

				>How? What are you assuming the UBI would be? Minimum wage? I'm not.
				
				Let's assume 10 million people loses their jobs to AI. All truckers, taxi drivers, customer service people etc. 
				
				They now are all skillless and put of work but they get $2000 a month from the government. There is mass unemoyment which causes the economy to fall into depression since many of the truck drivers now make $6000 less per month and can't afford anything.  If they get jobs the jobs are going to pay less not more because there are 1000 applicants for every entry level position.
				
				The UBI did nothing to offset the loss of economy due to AI.
				
				>Why are we assuming more consolidation would happen in this system?
				
				A key measure of economic growth is the velocity of money. Poor and middle class spend money quickly and it circulates quickly. With AI more money is funneled into the accounts of the mega rich who save it or reinvest it which decreases the velocity.
				
				Let's say I gpay you $100 to do a job for me. You pay someone else $100 to do a job and so on. That money changes hands and services is performed dozens of times in one week. Inflation occurs but the benefit of that money change hands far outweighs the inflation. Now with Jeff Bezos having an extra $100, it is going to sit around in an account. The economy shrank. 
				
				This is why the economy boomed is the 50s. 
				
				>Entertainment companies would still want to make money and would lobby the government to make this fictional UBI enough for them to get a cut.
				
				For UBI to not lower peoples quality of living, the UBI would basically just be the government taking the company away. You would be just replacing their entire wages or last wages.  The math doesn't work in this.  
				
				>Like how it is now with most companies being publicly traded? Most companies bigger than my local comic shop are publicly traded and owned by "people directly." Or indirectly through pensions and 401k's
				
				It's very simple. I own shares of Google. Google doesn't pay me anything as a partial owner. The shares are only good for selling to someone based on the value of Google which hopefully will be higher when i sell the shares. 
				
				Often times companies have different classes of stocks where if you are rich enough, you get dividends that poorer people don't. Or other times where you get more votes in the company.  Hopefully you can see where this shows a very clear division in stocks where they are not worth the same and not equal. 
				
				Rich people who own all the Google shares have the right to say, we are paying ourselfs $1 billion each now that we laid off 10,000 workers and you poor people with $1,000 worth of our shares get nothing. 
				
				Private ownership let's owners basically do whatever they want and when people get to do whatever they want with money they always give it to themselves. That's why these tech companies are going to be a huge problem very soon

			No idea, I'm an idiot on the internet wasting time at work, I'm not an economist. If we implemented something like this it would need to be constantly updated to keep up with inflation and changing prices and probably need to be handled or augmented by the states due to different costs of living in different areas.

						I addressed all of those - entrepreneurship would not be totally inaccessible but it's not a valid means of employment for the general public. As for this being the same argument in the past, all I can say is I just  believe AI's power to influence the economy will be far more than the industrial revolution's influence.

	There will have to be an equilibrium at some point. If AI makes production more and more efficient and companies start producing more and more commodities, who's gonna buy said commodities if everyone is unemployed? Capitalism does have an incentive to not let unemployment get too bad or else it stops working. Not to say that it won't cause a lot of suffering and job loss, it probably will unfortunately. Capitalism still functions with a much higher unemployment rate then we have now but once it starts to get into crazy numbers like 50 percent unemployment, markets will start to fail from lack of enough people to buy the goods.

			That wouldn't be an equilibrium if everyone is unemployed. My point is that under a capitalist system once unemployment gets high enough markets will start to fail and at that point corporations will be incentivized to not let it get to that point and will actively start pushing for jobs to be created. Not out of concern for people's wellbeing but out of self preservation. If everyone is unemployed corporations will die, they need customers to sell their products to and if everyone is unemployed they don't have any customers to sell to.

				I agree that companies need to fill that gap in consumption and that definitely can help unemployment. Though I do still also see the situation in which welfare/ubi props up consumption to the point in which companies can sustain only employing AI as it'd be the only way to stay competitive - if everyone is employing AI and a company decides to employ labor, the profit loss is gonna make them uncompetitve.

	I don't feel like you understand what modern AI is or how it works. The current generation of AI are language models, able to parse natural language and return natural language queries in convincing natural language. Such AI has very little significance in the production of goods, it's not going to make a piece of cloth weave faster, it's not going to make a cow produce more milk, and it's not going to going to get more cobalt out of a tonne of ore. It's not going to grow more crops in an acre of land and it's not going to turn salt water into fresh water. The idea that "AI" will just push us into some kind of post-scarcity world is simply inconsistent with the current reality of the technology.

	As for everyone becoming unemployed, that's simply not going to happen, market forces don't allow that. Automation isn't free, AI run on massive data centers, automated robots are incredibly expensive. How does a company run such things when they have no consumers with enough money to buy their products? They can't. So they'll have to hire humans if they want to be able to operate. AI and automation are scarce resources, they more useful they are, they more expensive they'll become, see the price of GPUs.

	Suppose Goldman Sachs and Wendy's both want to use AI, they are essentially bidding on the same compute power at some data center. Goldman Sachs wants to use that AI to maximize value in its mergers and acquisitions strategies, Wendy's wants to use AI to write snarky tweets. Who ends up being able to pay more for AI? Who ends up having to hire humans instead to do the same job? Apply this across the economy, unless AI becomes some kind of abundant resource, there will always be a scarcity of AI that leads to human employment.

	The future you see supposes a post-scarcity world, but there's nothing in modern AI development that suggests such a world is anywhere in sight.
