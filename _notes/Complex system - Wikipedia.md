From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

A **complex system** is a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System") composed of many components which may interact with each other. Examples of complex systems are Earth's global [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate"), [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisms "Organisms"), the [human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain "Human brain"), infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, complex [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software") and electronic systems, social and economic organizations (like [cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities "Cities")), an [ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem "Ecosystem"), a living [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)"), and, ultimately, for some authors, the entire [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe").<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

Complex systems are [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System") whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are "[complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity "Complexity")" have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as [nonlinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system "Nonlinear system"), [emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence "Emergence"), [spontaneous order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order "Spontaneous order"), [adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system "Complex adaptive system"), and [feedback loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback "Feedback"), among others. Because such systems appear in a wide variety of fields, the commonalities among them have become the topic of their independent area of research. In many cases, it is useful to represent such a system as a network where the nodes represent the components and links to their interactions.

The term _complex systems_ often refers to the study of complex systems, which is an approach to science that investigates how relationships between a system's parts give rise to its collective behaviors and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The study of complex systems regards collective, or system-wide, behaviors as the fundamental object of study; for this reason, complex systems can be understood as an alternative paradigm to [reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism "Reductionism"), which attempts to explain systems in terms of their constituent parts and the individual interactions between them.

As an interdisciplinary domain, complex systems draws contributions from many different fields, such as the study of [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization "Self-organization") and critical phenomena from physics, that of [spontaneous order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order "Spontaneous order") from the social sciences, [chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") from mathematics, [adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system "Complex adaptive system") from biology, and many others. _Complex systems_ is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines, including [statistical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_physics "Statistical physics"), [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory"), [nonlinear dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system "Nonlinear system"), [anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology"), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"), [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), and [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology").

### Adaptation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_system&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Adaptation")\]

[Complex adaptive systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system "Complex adaptive system") are special cases of complex systems that are [adaptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_system "Adaptive system") in that they have the capacity to change and learn from experience. Examples of complex adaptive systems include the [stock market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market "Stock market"), social insect and [ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant "Ant") colonies, the [biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere "Biosphere") and the [ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem "Ecosystem"), the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain "Human brain") and the [immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system "Immune system"), the [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)") and the developing [embryo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo "Embryo"), cities, [manufacturing businesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing "Manufacturing") and any human social group-based endeavor in a cultural and [social system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_system "Social system") such as [political parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party "Political party") or [communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community "Community").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

## Features\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_system&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Features")\]

Complex systems may have the following features:<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

Complex systems may be open

Complex systems are usually [open systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_(systems_theory) "Open system (systems theory)") — that is, they exist in a [thermodynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic "Thermodynamic") gradient and dissipate energy. In other words, complex systems are frequently far from energetic [equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium "Thermodynamic equilibrium"): but despite this flux, there may be [pattern stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pattern_stability&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pattern stability (page does not exist)"),<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> see [synergetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Haken) "Synergetics (Haken)").

Complex systems may exhibit critical transitions

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Alternative_stable_states%2C_critical_transitions%2C_and_the_direction_of_critical_slowing_down.png/220px-Alternative_stable_states%2C_critical_transitions%2C_and_the_direction_of_critical_slowing_down.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alternative_stable_states,_critical_transitions,_and_the_direction_of_critical_slowing_down.png)

Graphical representation of alternative stable states and the direction of critical slowing down prior to a critical transition (taken from Lever et al. 2020).<sup id="cite_ref-auto11_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-auto11-8">[8]</a></sup> Top panels (a) indicate stability landscapes at different conditions. Middle panels (b) indicate the rates of change akin to the slope of the stability landscapes, and bottom panels (c) indicate a recovery from a perturbation towards the system's future state (c.I) and in another direction (c.II).

[Critical transitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_transition "Critical transition") are abrupt shifts in the state of [ecosystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem "Ecosystem"), the [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate"), [financial systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_system "Financial system") or other complex systems that may occur when changing conditions pass a critical or [bifurcation point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory "Bifurcation theory").<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> The 'direction of critical slowing down' in a system's state space may be indicative of a system's future state after such transitions when delayed negative feedbacks leading to oscillatory or other complex dynamics are weak.<sup id="cite_ref-auto11_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-auto11-8">[8]</a></sup>

Complex systems may be [nested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy#Nested_hierarchy "Hierarchy")

The components of a complex system may themselves be complex systems. For example, an [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics") is made up of [organisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation "Organisation"), which are made up of [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person "Person"), which are made up of [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)") – all of which are complex systems. The arrangement of interactions within complex bipartite networks may be nested as well. More specifically, bipartite ecological and organisational networks of mutually beneficial interactions were found to have a nested structure.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> This structure promotes indirect facilitation and a system's capacity to persist under increasingly harsh circumstances as well as the potential for large-scale systemic regime shifts.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

Dynamic network of multiplicity

As well as [coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling "Coupling") rules, the dynamic [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_network "Biological network") of a complex system is important. [Small-world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network "Small-world network") or [scale-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network "Scale-free network") networks<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> which have many local interactions and a smaller number of inter-area connections are often employed. Natural complex systems often exhibit such topologies. In the human [cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex "Cerebral cortex") for example, we see dense local connectivity and a few very long [axon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axonal "Axonal") projections between regions inside the cortex and to other brain regions.

May produce emergent phenomena

Complex systems may exhibit behaviors that are [emergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence "Emergence"), which is to say that while the results may be sufficiently determined by the activity of the systems' basic constituents, they may have properties that can only be studied at a higher level. For example, empirical food webs display regular, scale-invariant features across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems when studied at the level of clustered 'trophic' species.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Another example is offered by the [termites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termites "Termites") in a mound which have physiology, biochemistry and biological development at one level of analysis, whereas their [social behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_behavior "Social behavior") and mound building is a property that emerges from the collection of termites and needs to be analyzed at a different level.

Relationships are non-linear

In practical terms, this means a small perturbation may cause a large effect (see [butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect "Butterfly effect")), a proportional effect, or even no effect at all. In linear systems, the effect is _always_ directly proportional to cause. See [nonlinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinearity "Nonlinearity").

Relationships contain feedback loops

Both negative ([damping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_ratio "Damping ratio")) and positive (amplifying) [feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback "Feedback") are always found in complex systems. The effects of an element's behavior are fed back in such a way that the element itself is altered.

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_system&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: History")\]

In 1948, Dr. Warren Weaver published an essay on "Science and Complexity",<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> exploring the diversity of problem types by contrasting problems of simplicity, disorganized complexity, and organized complexity. Weaver described these as "problems which involve dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole."

While the explicit study of complex systems dates at least to the 1970s,<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> the first research institute focused on complex systems, the [Santa Fe Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute "Santa Fe Institute"), was founded in 1984.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Early Santa Fe Institute participants included physics Nobel laureates [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann "Murray Gell-Mann") and [Philip Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Warren_Anderson "Philip Warren Anderson"), economics Nobel laureate [Kenneth Arrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arrow "Kenneth Arrow"), and Manhattan Project scientists [George Cowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cowan "George Cowan") and [Herb Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_L._Anderson "Herbert L. Anderson").<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Today, there are over 50 institutes and research centers focusing on complex systems.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Since the late 1990s, the interest of mathematical physicists in researching economic phenomena has been on the rise. The proliferation of cross-disciplinary research with the application of solutions originated from the physics epistemology has entailed a gradual paradigm shift in the theoretical articulations and methodological approaches in economics, primarily in financial economics. The development has resulted in the emergence of a new branch of discipline, namely "econophysics", which is broadly defined as a cross-discipline that applies statistical physics methodologies which are mostly based on the complex systems theory and the chaos theory for economics analysis.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

The 2021 [Nobel Prize in Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physics "Nobel Prize in Physics") was awarded to [Syukuro Manabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syukuro_Manabe "Syukuro Manabe"), [Klaus Hasselmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Hasselmann "Klaus Hasselmann"), and [Giorgio Parisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Parisi "Giorgio Parisi") for their work to understand complex systems. Their work was used to create more accurate computer models of the effect of global warming on the Earth's climate.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

## Applications\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_system&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Applications")\]

### Complexity in practice\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_system&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Complexity in practice")\]

The traditional approach to dealing with complexity is to reduce or constrain it. Typically, this involves compartmentalization: dividing a large system into separate parts. Organizations, for instance, divide their work into departments that each deal with separate issues. Engineering systems are often designed using modular components. However, modular designs become susceptible to failure when issues arise that bridge the divisions.

### Complexity of cities\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_system&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Complexity of cities")\]

Jane Jacobs described cities as being a problem in organized complexity in 1961, citing Dr. Weaver's 1948 essay.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> As an example, she explains how an abundance of factors interplay into how various urban spaces lead to a diversity of interactions, and how changing those factors can change how the space is used, and how well the space supports the functions of the city. She further illustrates how cities have been severely damaged when approached as a problem in simplicity by replacing organized complexity with simple and predictable spaces, such as Le Corbusier's "Radiant City" and Ebenezer Howard's "Garden City". Since then, others have written at length on the complexity of cities.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

### Complexity economics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_system&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Complexity economics")\]

Over the last decades, within the emerging field of [complexity economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_economics "Complexity economics"), new predictive tools have been developed to explain economic growth. Such is the case with the models built by the [Santa Fe Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute "Santa Fe Institute") in 1989 and the more recent [economic complexity index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_complexity_index "Economic complexity index") (ECI), introduced by the [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT "MIT") physicist [Cesar A. Hidalgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_A._Hidalgo "Cesar A. Hidalgo") and the [Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard "Harvard") economist [Ricardo Hausmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Hausmann "Ricardo Hausmann").

[Recurrence quantification analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_quantification_analysis "Recurrence quantification analysis") has been employed to detect the characteristic of [business cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycles "Business cycles") and [economic development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development "Economic development"). To this end, Orlando et al.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> developed the so-called recurrence quantification correlation index (RQCI) to test correlations of RQA on a sample signal and then investigated the application to business time series. The said index has been proven to detect hidden changes in time series. Further, Orlando et al.,<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> over an extensive dataset, shown that recurrence quantification analysis may help in anticipating transitions from laminar (i.e. regular) to turbulent (i.e. chaotic) phases such as USA GDP in 1949, 1953, etc. Last but not least, it has been demonstrated that recurrence quantification analysis can detect differences between macroeconomic variables and highlight hidden features of economic dynamics.

### Complexity and education\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_system&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Complexity and education")\]

Focusing on issues of student persistence with their studies, Forsman, Moll and Linder explore the "viability of using complexity science as a frame to extend methodological applications for physics education research", finding that "framing a social network analysis within a complexity science perspective offers a new and powerful applicability across a broad range of PER topics".<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

### Complexity and biology\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_system&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Complexity and biology")\]

Complexity science has been applied to living organisms, and in particular to biological systems. One of the areas of research is the emergence and evolution of intelligent systems. Analyses of the parameters of intellectual systems, patterns of their emergence and evolution, distinctive features, and the constants and limits of their structures and functions made it possible to measure and compare the capacity of communications (~100 to 300 million m/s), to quantify the number of components in intellectual systems (~10<sup>11</sup> neurons), and to calculate the number of successful links responsible for cooperation (~10<sup>14</sup> synapses)<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> Within the emerging field of [fractal physiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_physiology "Fractal physiology"), bodily signals, such as heart rate or brain activity, are characterized using [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy "Entropy") or fractal indices. The goal is often to assess the state and the health of the underlying system, and diagnose potential disorders and illnesses.

### Complexity and chaos theory\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_system&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Complexity and chaos theory")\]

Complex systems theory is rooted in [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory"), which in turn has its origins more than a century ago in the work of the French mathematician [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré"). Chaos is sometimes viewed as extremely complicated information, rather than as an absence of order.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> Chaotic systems remain deterministic, though their long-term behavior can be difficult to predict with any accuracy. With perfect knowledge of the initial conditions and the relevant equations describing the chaotic system's behavior, one can theoretically make perfectly accurate predictions of the system, though in practice this is impossible to do with arbitrary accuracy. [Ilya Prigogine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine "Ilya Prigogine") argued<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> that complexity is non-deterministic and gives no way whatsoever to precisely predict the future.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

The emergence of complex systems theory shows a domain between deterministic order and randomness which is complex.<sup id="cite_ref-PC98_37-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-PC98-37">[37]</a></sup> This is referred to as the "[edge of chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_of_chaos "Edge of chaos")".<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Lorenz_attractor_yb.svg/200px-Lorenz_attractor_yb.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lorenz_attractor_yb.svg)

A plot of the [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_attractor "Lorenz attractor")

When one analyzes complex systems, sensitivity to initial conditions, for example, is not an issue as important as it is within chaos theory, in which it prevails. As stated by Colander,<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> the study of complexity is the opposite of the study of chaos. Complexity is about how a huge number of extremely complicated and dynamic sets of relationships can generate some simple behavioral patterns, whereas chaotic behavior, in the sense of deterministic chaos, is the result of a relatively small number of non-linear interactions.<sup id="cite_ref-PC98_37-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-PC98-37">[37]</a></sup> For recent examples in economics and business see Stoop et al.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> who discussed [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system) "Android (operating system)")'s market position, Orlando <sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> who explained the corporate dynamics in terms of mutual synchronization and chaos regularization of bursts in a group of chaotically bursting cells and Orlando et al.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> who modelled financial data (Financial Stress Index, swap and equity, emerging and developed, corporate and government, short and long maturity) with a low-dimensional deterministic model.

Therefore, the main difference between chaotic systems and complex systems is their history.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> Chaotic systems do not rely on their history as complex ones do. Chaotic behavior pushes a system in equilibrium into chaotic order, which means, in other words, out of what we traditionally define as 'order'.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon. (September 2011)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> On the other hand, complex systems evolve far from equilibrium at the edge of chaos. They evolve at a critical state built up by a history of irreversible and unexpected events, which physicist [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann "Murray Gell-Mann") called "an accumulation of frozen accidents".<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> In a sense chaotic systems can be regarded as a subset of complex systems distinguished precisely by this absence of historical dependence. Many real complex systems are, in practice and over long but finite periods, robust. However, they do possess the potential for radical qualitative change of kind whilst retaining systemic integrity. Metamorphosis serves as perhaps more than a metaphor for such transformations.

### Complexity and network science\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Complex_system&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Complexity and network science")\]

A complex system is usually composed of many components and their interactions. Such a system can be represented by a network where nodes represent the components and links represent their interactions.<sup id="cite_ref-DorogovtsevMendes2003_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-DorogovtsevMendes2003-45">[45]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Newman2010_46-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#cite_note-Newman2010-46">[46]</a></sup> For example, the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") can be represented as a network composed of nodes (computers) and links (direct connections between computers).
