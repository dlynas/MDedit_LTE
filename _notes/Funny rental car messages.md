	It's not venture capital, it's private equity and real estate investments trusts. Venture capital is a form of private equity where the partners invest in start ups or very early stage companies. Not that it's hugely important, it's still completely fucked up. I just work in the industry and am anal about verbiage. 

	If you're ever bored and wanna get angry, look up the assets managed and holdings of Blackstone's BREIT fund. 53% ($60.5 billion dollars) of their portfolio is holding single family rentals, multi family rentals, or student housing. Again, that's over $60 billion worth of housing owned by ONE fund of ONE company (albeit the largest in REITs).

		Officially triggered. Grab your pitchforks, boys. This is it.

			Now if only IF it actually resulted in people grabbing their pitch-forks.  American's are woefully unwilling to do much besides complain, they don't even vote reliably.

				That's not true. Tons of them reliably vote against their own best interests.

				For all their flaws, the French are much better with the pitchforks than us Americans

				Unfortunately our political system has failed us. Public opinion on a bill has basically zero impact on the likelihood of it becoming/not becoming a law. lobbying and paying for candidate campaigns make a huge impact. It's normal for a lobbyist to write their own bill which heavily benefits their industry/company, pay a politician to slap their name on it, and lobby for the rest to vote for it. Politicians are puppets for the rich. They only use the people for the votes but never do anything to help those same people because they are getting paid from the rich.

				Ask any historian if they actually want to live through the revolution. Grabbing pitchforks may become necessary at some point to make things improvie. But selfishly, I hope it is after my natural, non-revolutionary death.

					You have a congress and senate that influence more of your country's laws than Biden or Trump do. Your entire political discourse is tied up at the top, misdirected, when municipal, state and Senatorial politics have a higher influence on things you should be pissed about. It's all a scam but most Americans are mad at the wrong person.

						I am just speaking for myself, but I do research every person on the ballot and vote based on every scrap of information available. I'm talking as much real data as I can find such as how a candidate has voted on bills in the past rather than the reality tv shit shows that are the debates they air.
						
						It doesn't even matter. Our voting system needs a major overhaul to get away from gerrymandering and open up the vote to allow for someone in a party other than the main two to win. However that's unlikely to ever happen because why would they change a system in a way that would make it harder to stay in office?
						
						In fact, many of the swing vote states, including the one I live in, passed legislation to make it more difficult to vote with the belief that the type of limitations they institute will eliminate voters that are likely to vote in a particular way.
						
						Does it counter what you said? No, not at all, but there are those of us with our eyes open. Despite that, major news outlets and social media flood us with disinformation and opinionated views leading to a large number of people voting based on lies and entertainment.
						
						If you can't tell, I'm frustrated and angry at the system. Am I posting this mostly to vent those frustrations and feel a little bit better about things I don't feel I have much control over? Guilty as charged.
						
						Despite how jaded I sound in this post, I still have hope for change. I will continue researching the candidates and voting based on facts and a candidate's history of support.

						What senators are running on a platform to combat private equity from purchasing homes? And which of those senators(if they even exist) have a enough money backing their campaign to even have a punchers' chance at winning their election?
						
						And to pretend like the president doesn't have SOMETHING to do with policy is so unbelievably ignorant to the political power that position holds.  Sure they can't just write laws and have them passed, but did we not see Trump bully senators for 4 year to fall in line with almost everything he wanted? People act like the president is a hapless stooge.

		In Texas, 2022, 1/3 of residential home sales were to corporations. Wild

		It is important to differentiate them. There are bills in Congress being proposed to "limit venture capitalists from buying single family homes" which sounds great, until you look at the definition and realize venture capitalists never wanted to in the first place. It's about as useful as imposing a cruise ship inspection for all vessels entering Montana.

		Your spot on
		
		[Gary Stevenson ](https://youtu.be/FDpVj64DrcQ?feature=shared) discusses the process quite well.
