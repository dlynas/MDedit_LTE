People have lost their minds. Israel killing thousands, blocking humanitarian aid and leveling cities isn't enough evidence to establish genocidal intent but high school students chanting an ambiguous slogan is? [theatlantic.com/magazine/archi](https://t.co/CWEIsCU1vs)



This article does include real examples of antisemitism and it would be bizarre to pretend it doesn't exist on the left but it's telling that the author consistently conflates them with a movement against mass death and oppression. Should kids \*not\* learn about Palestine?

It's true that attacks against Jews rose in the month after Oct. 7, but the evidence that the \*organized antiwar movement\* is driven by antisemitism doesn't hold up. This restaurant was targeted because the owners raised money for the IDF, not because they're Jewish.

Personally I think the antiwar movement is driven by genuine moral revulsion at the undisputed images of mass slaughter and starvation coming out of Gaza. It's obscene that every week this magazine finds an excuse to ask whether it's "really" acting on ulterior motives.

"Let's unite East and West Germany", a slogan that suggests the elimination of West Germany.

Antisemitism in America is something that Americans are actually responsible for and also can actually curb. If high school students in America are chanting antisemitic slogans, that means a bunch of Americans are doing the wrong things and should eat the consequences.

Yeah. If means what they say it means, then a Jewish publication wouldn't have published it.

Michael Solomonov and his restaurants were raising funds for an emergency medical and ambulance service called Hatzalah, which offers emergency medical aid to ALL citizens in Israel. That means, Arabs, Jews, Christians, Druze, etc

Does “teaching Palestine” include the part where they claim Oct 7th was friendly fire? Protesters were also pounding on the windows of a restaurant owned by Jose Andrés, the one person actually delivering food aid in Gaza.

Remember how conservatives heard "black lives matter" as anti cop and anti white? Now they hear "free Palestine" as "kill the Jews." Weird. It's like they deliberately mishear us to avoid addressing our critique & simultaneously paint themselves as the aggrieved party.

This makes sense when you remember that the Atlantic's editor in chief is an American who volunteered to serve in the IDF as a guard at a prison that's infamous for human rights violations.

If a series of natural disasters leads to a significant increase in poverty worldwide year after year, will this result in prolonged and terrible wars for resources? If so, it indicates that modern humans are very weak in terms of compassion and spirituality. Being humane,

The slogan isn’t ambiguous, it’s a call for Palestinian freedom.

I’ve seen the same kind of arguments around Ukraine. The genocide Russia is perpetrating is described as normal war or legitimate (for some reason), while, e.g. Ukraine’s encouragement of the use of Ukrainian is being portrayed as nazism.

Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg still carries the mindset of an IDF prison guard

Are they going to keep making the same article each week

One way to make sense of this, I think, is to recognize that for millions of ppl, anyone PERCEIVED as "white" is real and their fears and emotions and needs are real. Whereas, someone perceived as anything else, their fears, emotions, needs, THEIR DEATHS, even, just don't matter.

very silly that they're crying over a peaceful walk out at a high school in America . Palestinian high schoolers can't do any kind of "walkout" because their schools are rubble and the students were killed

I don’t see how “Israel is committing horrrific war crimes” and “US Jews are in danger” are somehow mutually exclusive?

The article is really about America. And this article rings true for many Gen-Xers who grew up in the northeast amongst the WWII diaspora. And Bibi is hastening it all...

This is a disappointingly facile take that conveniently doesn’t screenshot the extensive offensive content quoted in the article and seems to invent claims. Meanwhile Jews in America are struggling to find out where we can feel safe.
