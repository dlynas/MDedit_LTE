## Where does money go when it's taxed

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mmt_economics/comments/1c0wfr6/where_does_money_go_when_its_taxed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mmt_economics/comments/1c0wfr6/where_does_money_go_when_its_taxed/)

> I think Mosler said in the old days when the gov taxed paper money it would just burn it (rather than redirecting that same paper money back into circulation). With digital money, when it gets taxed it just gets deleted I think. Is there any proof of this? Like can we find out exactly what happens to money when it gets taxed by looking at the gov financial statements or something?

	It depends which form of money we're talking about. 

	Bank deposits get deleted. When taxes are paid the bank marks down the deposit account, then the Fed will mark down the bank's reserve account. That way there are matching entries on both the assets and liabilities side of their balance sheet.

	The Fed, after marking down the bank's reserve account, will then mark up the [Treasury's account](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WTREGEN) by the same amount. So for accounting purposes the reserves are transferred and not deleted. You can see all the deposits and withdrawals for the TGA in the Daily Treasury Statement, [here's yesterday's](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/static-data/published-reports/dts/DailyTreasuryStatement_20240409.pdf).

	However the important thing to note is that the TGA is not counted as part of the money supply. So deposits into the TGA reduce the money supply while withdrawals from the TGA increase the money supply. It's in that sense that government spending creates money and taxes destroy money.

	The TGA is ostensibly the government's bank account and an anti-MMT argument is often made that the government is limited in it's spending based on the TGA, but that's not true. It's a trivial exercise for the Treasury and Fed to keep the TGA number positive. The government can always sell bonds, and if that risks pushing up the target rate then the Fed will just buy existing bonds to add reserves so that they can be used to buy the new bonds. A big deal will be made about how the Fed doesn't fund the government and these are operations to maintain liquidity and achieve their interest rate target, but it's ultimately the same thing as the Fed funding the Treasury. On a consolidated public sector basis, it really is just creating money out of nothing when it's spent and destroying or deleting it when it's taxed.

		Not to mention that 
		
		1. There's *nothing* preventing the TGA's balance going negative. In fact, the UK's Consolidated Fund (CF) is **always** non-positive, going negative each day before taxes and bond issuance top it up to zero.
		
		2. The US Federal Reserve's entire balance sheet (less any statutory expenses and member bank dividends to pay out) is indemnified by the US Treasury and, ultimately, the entire government. Any credit claim that the Treasury has on the Fed via a positive TGA balance is simultaneously a debt obligation to the Treasury since the Fed's liabilities are wholely the Treasury's. It's just internal accounting fiction.

			Is 1) true in the US though? I'm well aware that the UK treasury is allowed overdrafts, but isn't it different in the US? Has the TGA actually ever gone negative? In the debt ceiling crises, the secretary is always talking about running out of money and using "extreme measures". Wouldn't going into the red be one of these extreme measures?

				Potentially, but that is just all artificial constraints. Congress could change those rules tomorrow if it wanted. But yes, I get the perspective you're using in that under *current* processes, the TGA is kept at a positive balance via shifting reserves around and Treasury's accounts at commercial banks.

					>There's nothing preventing the TGA's balance going negative
					
					
					Just to belabor the point then, can't we say that this isn't really true? Congress has prevented the general account from going into the red by law. I totally agree that Congress COULD change that if they wanted, but given that they haven't, it seems a little misleading to word it this way.
					
					
					We have the same understanding of the mechanics I think, so this is admittedly just a semantic quibble. But I do think the semantics are quite important. Just look at how frequently MMT is misrepresented in the popular discourse - at the root of it is often these semantic differences. Like mmt says that debts and deficits never matter for solvency purposes, and then ignorant or disingenuous people conflate that with saying that deficits NEVER matter, full stop. I think it's necessary for us to really bend over backwards and use the most exhaustively accurate language as possible. That way, hopefully, there can be no doubt as to the accuracy of the MMT perspective.

						Yeah I always prefer to argue from the perspective that even if we change nothing at all the MMT claim that the US isn't fiscally constrained still holds true.
						
						It would obviously be more clear and helpful if laws were changed to get rid of all the anachronistic nonsense, but I think it's important to show it's not necessary.
						
						It obviously makes the most sense to ignore all that in an abstract academic setting to establish the principles, but as you say, that will be misrepresented once people start adding the bureaucratic and legal layers on top of it.

	[u/AnUnmetPlayer](https://www.reddit.com/user/AnUnmetPlayer) 's answer was spot on, but I'll add this.

	From a first principles credit-based perspective, the issuer of nation state credit (the US Federal government via its fiscal agent, the Federal Reserve) creates new liabilities when it conducts spending. They are liabilities to the government precisely *because* they are valued as credit assets to the non-government. And they are valued as credit assets to the non-government because they enable it to liberate it from its tax debt to the government.

	When the tax debt obligation the non-government has is redeemed, it returns the government's credits to it. The credit asset cancels out the tax liability from the non-government's perspective, and the tax "asset" cancels out the issued credit liability from the government's perspective. There is a double pair of asset liabilities that both delete themselves when taxes are paid.

	The only possible result is that the previously issued credit is destroyed and no longer exists. An issuer of a credit cannot hold its own credit as its asset otherwise we'd all be super wealthy.

	Note that the **credit** is a non-physical abstract social relation. It is **not** any conduit or physical body that the credit catches a ride on such as paper or coin currency or digital storage media. The credit ceases to exist even if physical cash is used to pay tax. The tax is not burned in the modern day as they would only have to print more to replace it, which is a waste. The cash is reused and issued out again, but the credit that embodies the cash upon re-issuance is brand new.

	Think of it this way. When you pay taxes, you write a check. The dollars come out of what is called the M2 money supply measure.

	But when the dollars reach the Treasury, they instantly disappear from the M2 money supply measure and are not found in any money supply measure. 

	In short, they disappear. They effectively are destroyed by joining the Treasury‚Äôs infinite money supply. Adding dollars to infinite dollars still yields infinite dollars.

	These dollars, which are not spent and are not part of any money supply, no longer exist. They have they been destroyed.

	Demonstrating this is basically the thesis of [Stephanie Kelton's seminal paper](http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/can-taxes-and-bonds-finance-government-spending).
