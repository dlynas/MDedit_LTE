## What are the invisible "rules" that make you a good friend?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1awqg1s/what_are_the_invisible_rules_that_make_you_a_good/](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1awqg1s/what_are_the_invisible_rules_that_make_you_a_good/)

> I (22F) grew up in an introverted family in a rural area, I spend a lot of time with myself or with my siblings who are just as socially inept as I am and didn't realize it was weird. 
> 
> A few years ago I moved to a larger city and I am in social setting often. It took a while, but I also have friends now too. But I've never figured out all the social rules that make you a good friend or a good stranger or a good coworker. 
> 
> For example, one time I was talking with a friend about making plans together when another friend came over where we were talking. The first friend gracefully changed the subject and then texted me later to finish making the plans. I thought she didn't want to have plans in the first place because she had changed the subject, but she told me that she changed the subject because it's not nice to make plans in front of someone who's not invited. I get that and I think it's lovely, but it honestly hadn't occurred to me. But that's the kind of thing I want to have on my mind, so that next time I can be kind in that way. 
> 
> Or once, a friend of mine while telling a story said "but of course I'd never cuss in front of a kid, so I..." and in my head I got hung up on that, because I'd never thought about whether you could cuss in front of a kid before. I don't think I have, but in my family the adults would cuss in front of us as kids either to express themselves or to be funny. And that seems like a sensible rule- don't cuss in front of kids- I would hate to break a rule like that, but it bothers me that I have never thought that through and just got lucky to have not made that mistake before I heard the rule. 
> 
> And I saw a tik tok one time about being a good friend where the creator said things like "when someone is telling a story and gets interrupted, you can bring the conversation back to them by saying, 'you were saying...'" what are the other things like that? 
> 
> I wasn't on the internet a lot until recently, so I was always left out when it came to internet culture and references and language. Then when I got social media and started watching more tv and being on the internet, I think I went way overboard with keeping up with internet culture and making references and using internet lingo because I thought that's how to communicate in a common language, but one of my friends said recently that using so much online lingo and talking about viral discourses on tik tok are out of touch. So does anyone know where the line is between keeping up enough to understand and relate, but not needing to touch grass? 
> 
> I've struggled with good friendships with other girls until I heard people talking about how to be a girl's girl, and I didn't realize all of the "girl code" things I was unintentionally breaking because I hadn't heard it and grown up with it, and even just the tiny things like "talk up your friends when they are around the person they like" have helped me with my friendships so much, what other rules have I missed? And beyond being a girl's girl, how can I be a person's person? 
> 
> I want to be a kind person who makes others feel seen and included and encouraged, and I also just want to be a socially acceptable person who doesn't keep messing up in social settings, so what tips and rules are out there? 
> 
> Thank you so much to everyone who reads and comments. :)

	Some general advice:

	1: Don’t make comments on anyone’s appearance if it can’t be fixed in less than a minute. Do not point out somebody’s height, weight, scars, acne, body hair etc

	2: Don’t mooch and don’t take more than you give. You don’t want to be the person that is *constantly* asking for notes, rides, snacks etc. especially if you’re not offering to return the favor or pay back in some way. 

	3: Pay attention to body language and sentence structure. For example, If you’re taking to someone and they seem closed off, body turned away from yo[u/turned](https://www.reddit.com/user/turned) towards the exit, and their responses to you are very short, it’s them signaling to you “I’m not interested in talking.” Don’t take it personally, just move on. 

	More specific to your case

	4: when someone is telling a story, dont interrupt with personal anecdotes even if it’s somewhat relevant. People tend to take that as an interruption and think you’re “hijacking their story.” Even if you have good intentions. Save the personal anecdotes for when the story is over. 

	5: as for girl code, If one of your friends is interested in somebody, don’t openly flirt with them. Don’t date their exes unless you’re okay with losing that friend. If they say they need to go to the bathroom at a public place (like a nightclub or any place with lots of potentially unsafe people) offer to go with them for a safety in numbers thing. 

	6: For the internet thing, it’s gonna depend on who you’re taking to and their age. Using a lot of TikTok lingo is okay if you’re 16, but maybe it’s gonna come across terminally online for someone who’s 22. But all that varies.

		These are fantastic!
		
		Here’s one I think fits on this list, that I was reminded of recently: Be careful with other’s money, and (reasonably) relaxed with your own. So: if you owe someone 10.50 for lunch, don’t just hand them a 10 and figure it’s fine. OTOH, if it’s 9.80, you give them a 10, and they’re scrambling to find change… consider telling them not to worry about it.

			When PS5’s first came out, we bought one for our daughter.  Then a different store had one so we bought that too, but we were still waiting for the first to be shipped.  I know others make profit, but it felt wrong.  So we offered it to my daughters best friend, at cost.  They agreed to buy it.  Then she showed up and handed me 300.00$, and asked me for her change.  I went and found her that 1 singular penny, and have not helped her since.

		I would like to add, being an engaged listener is huge too.  Truly listen to someone, ask pertinent questions when appropriate, if someone talks about how they love horse riding, ask them about it.  Disclaimer: No one is entitled to anyone else’s time, if they want to help educate you, great!  If not, and they close down the conversation, tell them it was great to see them &amp; don’t push.

	Fewer rules and more practice, I think.

	I learn from talking to people and watching what people who have the type of friendships that I desire do.

	Be willing to make social mistakes; it’s so human and acceptable, no matter what people tell you.

	Reach out to people and show enthusiasm. Don’t change your personality; I mean to show people that you’re interested in them as friends. Send the first text, invite people to things, tell them that you had fun hanging out, etc. That was a game changer for me because, well, people can’t read your mind. And as an introvert, it is easy for me to seem disinterested.

		This is a huge one. People get so worried about saying or doing the wrong thing, but they're (usually) very forgiving if someone else does. It's important to learn how to let that go, it leads to stronger relationships.

	Let's say Alice is complaining about Brenda.  Instead of joining the shit talking, focus on how Alice feels.  Say things like "oh my god you must have felt so frustrated!" or "how do you plan to bring this up with Brenda?  Do you want to practice?" 

	Basically you don't want to talk shit about a mutual friend, or even worse a friend's partner while they're venting.  You also don't want to come off as too good and try to defend Brenda, because that will just make Alice feel like shit.  People vent and it's normal.

				Will people bait you if they already decided they don't like you? Because tbh every time someone would talk shit about someone I would cycle between validating the person but then defending the other like, "Yeah I can see why that's frustrating and how you feel disrespected, maybe when you're ready you can talk to them directly? It sounds serious enough..." implying it would be hurtful if the shoe were on the other foot. 
				I am not close with anyone this situation played out with--only to watch others bond closely when they do have someone to punch down on. Apparently being "too nice" is a thing, and as an late self diagnosed aspie I cannot figure out the rules because I am at the bottom of the hierarchy and it seems when you're that low no one wants to acknowledge your existence, let alone ask your opinion, and it's awkward af feeling a group of people tolerate you for that one friend who is friends with "the weirdo". I do everything in my power to not talk negatively about anyone except politicians and people who have proven with their actions, and then I comment on those said actions... never personal, close to home where I could hurt my community or my chance of making a life in my hometown, where I already feel like a stranger. Why can't people just be blunt? Does anyone run off logic or is all emotional?

		Right? I found the tone of OP rather touching. 
		
		While I feel like my social experience over the years has built up a nice base for social interactions, I’ve found myself wanting to “level up” a bit more as my bubble expands past my peer group- as in, I'm in my 30s and starting to cultivate friendships with folks 20 to 40 years older. 
		
		I've noticed a lot of these older folks are especially graceful in conversation, little things like more formal introductions etc. I try to note the verbiage they use, the way they tell stories etc. 
		
		Socializing is a growing journey that never ends! It's great to be open and always stretching.

	A lot of mine are around hosting and food because that’s where I’ve experienced consideration or the lack there of. 

	If someone is hosting you don’t show up empty handed. That doesn’t mean that you have to bring expensive wine or anything, it can be bag of chips. 

	If you’re planning a group outing and two people don’t like each other but you like them invite them both and let them both know the other will be attending. If one person bows out make a point to reach out and schedule some one on one time. 

	If someone has a dietary restriction make sure there is a snack they can eat. Do not point out all of the food they can’t have, they know and they don’t need the reminder. 

	If you’ve invited someone to come with you to a house party and you’re picking up snacks and/or drinks ahead of time, ask them if they would like anything. 

	If someone is telling you a story or talking about their day and you accidentally interrupt them stay calm, it happens. Stop yourself and say to them, “you know what? I just realized I interrupted you, I’m sorry. Can we go back? You were telling me about your dog Rudolphus.”

	Before anything I say or do, I ask myself if I would want someone to say or do that to me or for me. Also, just be yourself. I've always been so awkward but my friends know and love that about me. If someone can't get over my inability to not be awkward I wouldn't want to be their friend anyways. I cared so much more what others thought of me through my teens and early 20s. At almost 34 years old now I really could care less what someone has to say about me especially if they won't say it to my face.

		This is such good advice but I just want to add that we should remember everyone is different and some people are more sensitive than others. I used to do unto others as I would like them to do unto me, but I'm not sensitive at all so I had to learn to consider that the other person might be and go from there as far as what I said and jokes I told.

	Only say something as private and weird as they've said to you already. This one I'm an idiot at and it took me a looong time to figure it out. People don't want to know weird secrets about you or information that other people think should be private. But everyone has a different comfort level and different stuff they think is weird. Like if you think of a weird tangentially related story but it's more private than what you're already talking about then don't tell that story. (Internet doesn't count I do whatever I want on Internet, Internet doesn't care if ur weird. Or they REALLY care. But I can't see their faces reacting to it so it's fine with me)

	As someone who's spent the last five years trying learn social skills having ended up without any real friends after a move to a different city 12 years ago, in my experience practice through just talking with people is the best way to learn social skills. After all the reason we both ended up in our situations because we got left behind on getting experience with socializing with people outside family. 

	You are going to make mishaps when talking with people, but that's how you learn. I have had to mess up more times than I can count on how to get a conversation flowing to get to the point where I can help keep a conversation going, yet even after all my learning from trying there is always the factor of people being different and with some people I'll struggle to get a conversation going, while in the rare case I find someone with whom conversation just doesn't seem to end as it flows so smoothly. (also totally not vital to this, but for whatever reason the people I vibe with the most, with whom conversation flows the best, are always people who I'm not abel to talk with most due to sheer cosmic coincidence, like come on I find a person with whom I get along well but with whom I'll only be able to talk for a limited time...)

	In short, practice is in my experience the best way to learn. Additionally I believe that actions are more impactful than words in a friendship, as just saying that you care about someone is absolutely different than actually listening to someone during a conversation and giving them the opportunity to speak in contrast to just you being the one trying to talk (a problem for me has been how I sometimes forget the importance of listening and providing the other person a possibility to talk as well).

	I'd argue that you're already ahead of many just by showing a level of awareness in social situations. So many folks struggle with reading the room, and there's nothing you can really do but feel sorry for them.

	I think that it is awesome that you are retaining positive and negative feedback and that you're willing to optimize it to get the most out of your outward appearance. That's huge. It shows that you are empathetic and in control.

	The tried and true advice is to just practice and be active in refining who you are. Don't overthink past scenarios, but rather accept those experiences. There's just too many variables... many of which are out of your control.

	Lastly, just expect to be dynamic, but be mindful of where your boundaries are. There's not much you can do when you're being the most fair person in the room and the world around you is a circus.

	My biggest pitfall is that I forget to listen. Sometimes you've just got to pump the brakes for a moment to give you that time to receive that feedback.

	Give your friend space to own their experiences. I used to think my having gone through similar experiences meant I should share it to show that i understand and support them but I realised it was more important to just listen. Sometimes, I won't even mention I experienced it. I will just let them talk it out with me and try to validate them. Most people in my life know the things i've been through so it doesn't need to be repeated in every conversation.

	Don’t be blunt. If a friend gets a new haircut don’t say you liked the old one better just say it looks good.

	If a friend trips or spills something on themselves never laugh or make a big deal out of it.  Try to minimize their embarrassment.

	Don’t tease or make fun of their car, clothes, shoes, messy apartment, family, job, appearance, etc.

	If a friend has an interest or hobby you don’t care for don’t criticize it. Ask them about it and be a good listener.

	Try to avoid borrowing money but if you must because you forgot your wallet pay them back right away without being asked even if they say you don’t have to.

	If a friend doesn’t want to go somewhere with you don’t bully them til they change their mind.

	If you make plans with a friend don’t cancel if something seemingly better comes up.

	Don’t call or text a friend more than they call or text you.  Try to keep the relationship equal.

	Even if your friend is a good listener don’t use them as your therapist and dump all your problems on them.

	Try to be upbeat and fun and minimize or eliminate being negative even if things go wrong.

	If a friend buys a dress, shoes or jacket you admire don’t go out and buy the exact same thing.

	Don’t ask personal or nosy questions such as their gpa, how much money they make, how old their parents are, how much something cost.

	Don’t be late when you have plans. 

	Use good manners. Dont chew with your mouth open. Don’t double dip chips. Don’t lick your fingers.

	Don’t brag about your other friends to them or talk about things you did with other friends that you didn’t invite them to.

			Some parts are. Not all of it. You don’t have to take everything you read from a book.

	There's no rules anyone that says itherwose is just trying to minoukate you into being toxic makes me wonder for what reason the ither friend wasn't invited on that trip. Just be youreself and be respectful/polite/courtus of others. If it's a friend, humans like it when they feelnusfulnto others so just ask them to do small things if you enjoy thier time.

	I'm late to this post but I think it's worth mentioning - one of the best things I do to stay socially sharp is listening/watching comedies like stand up or sitcoms. They make you pay close attention to everyone's dialog so you can catch the next joke, and if I don't get it I'll look it up and try to understand. It's really helped me pick up on subtle cues like when someone's hinting that we should go because someone from their past just showed up, or you have something embarrassing going on with your appearance and they're trying to take you aside without humiliating you. I think it just helps with critical thinking skills and learning to always read between the lines.

	Don’t regift a friend a gift you previously received but didn’t like.

	If you exchange gifts with friends try to buy something they’d like not something you’d like to get.

	When going out with friends keep an eye on them and make sure not to get separated. 

	When dropping off a friend at home make sure they get safely inside their home before you drive off.

	If you run into another friend somewhere make sure to introduce your friend to your other friend.

	Don’t help yourself to food and beverages in your friend’s fridge. 

	Be careful with your friend’s home and possessions. Wipe your feet, take off your shoes, don’t flop down hard on furniture, use coasters for drinks, don’t pick up and touch decorative objects, don’t put your feet on the furniture, etc.

	Use good hygiene, wear deodorant, wear fresh clean clothes, brush your teeth and use mouthwash.

	If you are at a restaurant don’t take too long to figure out what you want to order. Don’t take or ask for food from your friend’s plate.

	Check out some etiquette books at the library. Good etiquette helps at work, with friends at school, etc.

	Don’t get mad easily and give friends the silent treatment. Don’t storm off when you are out somewhere.

	Be willing to compromise about where you go or eat. Don’t push to always get your first choice.
