					It is also missing social security, but like Medicare/medicaid, that is classified as mandatory spending and is not subject to an annual appropriations vote. Of course, the GOP would prefer that medicare and medicaid were subject to annual budget negotiations (cuts), and ensure that all younger generations are paid back much less than they paid in, instead of more than they paid in, like current retirees. If you cut out mandatory spending, the military gets more than half of the non-mandatory federal spending dollars.

The American Forces Network (AFN), provides U.S. radio and television news, information, and entertainment programming to active, guard, and reserve military service members, DoD civilians and contract employees, and their families overseas, on board Navy and Coast Guard ships, and to other authorized users. It includes radio and television stations in military communities in Europe, the Pacific and the Middle East; and includes its central broadcasting hub, the AFN Broadcast Center at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California. Also includes communication of messages and themes from senior DoD leaders in order to support and improve quality of life and morale, promote situational awareness, provide timely and immediate force protection information, and sustain readiness. Other services of Media Production include Defense Visual Information Distribution Service[9] and providing internal news and information products for Defense.gov, Army.mil, Navy.mil, Marines.mil, and AF.mil.

		Both the Democrats and the Republicans have effectively disabled the  Ethics Committee. They always put a bunch of political nobodies on it because the Committee doesn't really get any inside financial info they can use for insider trading like the other committees.
		
		And because it's a bunch of nobodies, none of them has power, so the office has no power. 
		
		This nation's government, and most of the states' governments, are so thoroughly corrupt that it's amazing that voting even seems to make a difference to them. 
		
		Seems like it's two competing groups of elites, and for the longest time they agreed to have rules to their competition (i.e. voting), but over the last 40 or so years, one side has been manipulating, lying, practicing demagoguery, trying to instigate violence among their small core group. It's bad.
		
		And it's so frustrating that the Democrats don't seem willing to actually help us. They don't hurt us *nearly* as much as the Republicans do, but they don't help us enough. 
		
		We need them to actually stop the massive economic leeches from feeding on us, from taking more and more from us but giving us less and less. We need to be *protected* from those leeches, from those useless eaters. 
		
		We might have to do it ourselves, without our representatives. Because, right now, they're not representing *us* as much as they're representing their own elite position and interests. And that's not good enough any longer. It's not good enough that they're simply *not as bad* as Republicans. That's still bad. They need to be *good for their consituents.*
		
		But who knows. Maybe it's time for the normal, non-sociopath folks among us to just shut down and accept the inevitable dominance. Shit, we can't even get enough people to *vote* in their own interests, and most seem perfectly content to just watch this dystopia unfold. Just watching it as if it's simply entertainment. As if videos of Trump saying he'd establish a dictatorship has no more gravity than a video of some generic TikToker doing something that a million others are doing but just doing it *slightly* better.
		
		Maybe we've already lost.

		* 🟧 **[zekeweasel](https://www.reddit.com/user/zekeweasel)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-12-16 12:50:29)_

			I feel like there's a distinction of some kind to be drawn between military and uniformed services here, but I'm not exactly sure what that is.
			
			For example, the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are uniformed services and commission officers, etc..   but are not military.   That's why the Surgeon General wears a uniform very similar to that of a Navy Vice Admiral and the Assistant Secretary for Health wears one similar to that of a full Admiral.   
			
			They're both commissioned officers - O-10 and O-9 respectively, and get saluted by colonels, lesser generals and admirals, etc..  And they get all the same pay and privileges as equivalent ranked admirals and generals.
			
			But they're not military.   PHS is under DHS in fact, and NOAA is under Department of Commerce.
			
			USCG is kind of neither fish nor fowl - they're not military in everyday operations, but they do act in an armed law enforcement capacity.   And they get absorbed into the Navy in wartime, so that confuses things a little as well.

			* 🟦 **[the_Q_spice](https://www.reddit.com/user/the_Q_spice)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-12-16 14:58:51)_

				The distinction is that of auxiliary services. 
				
				USCG Auxiliary, Civil Air Patrol, Military Auxiliary Radio System, Marine Corps Cyber Auxiliary, and Merchant Marine can all be commissioned as officers at any time deemed necessary, but do not regularly serve in the armed branches. 
				
				Basically, they serve as auxiliary support services to the armed branches and the commissioning process is done to temporarily transfer their command structure. 
				
				IE: the Navy doesn’t actually have enough captains for all of its ships during wartime and it takes too long to train officers - so they can (and frequently have) pulled merchant mariners or coast guardsmen into commission to fill those gaps. 
				
				NOAA, PHS, and USCG have have their own defined service branch roles and do not get auxiliary commissions by other branches but can be assigned to them in their respective support roles. 
				
				IE: USCG can help with maritime security, SAR, and law enforcement for Navy; PHS can help with response to national disasters - they don’t typically do forward deployment other than international health crises like Ebola; NOAA can support any service with technical guidance for weather reports and forecasting as well as coastal surveys and intelligence reports - interestingly they actually work alongside JSOC quite a bit, as well as the CIA. 
				
				NOAA is perhaps the most interesting one of the 3: the entire reason for commissioning them was due to their surveying and intelligence/data collection mission. Due to the nature of this work, they could be executed as spies if they were civilians doing the work during wartime - the solution to protect them under the Geneva Conventions was to create a Commissioned Corps. 
				
				During WWI and WWII, NOAA officers served quite often as artillery orienteering and mine laying experts (due to their expertise in surveying and geodetic operations) as well as intelligence officers for the Navy. NOAA officers were actually the designated Beachmasters for most US amphibious operations of WWII. 
				
				They are also credited with inventing the “time on target” artillery tactic and making over 100 million different charts and maps over the course of WWII (they made literally *all* of the maps for the US military, be that Army, USAAC, USMC, or Navy). 
				
				Basically, NOAA is one of the most important uniformed services - people just take their work for granted.

				* 🟪 **[gryphon313](https://www.reddit.com/user/gryphon313)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-12-16 16:09:39)_

					And if you think about it in terms of size:
					Like 350 for NOAA
					and around 5500 for PHS. 
					
					Compare that to just the AD numbers for the other services (including Space Force) and the impact per officer is crazy. 
					
					PHS aside from its response roles which are constantly shuffled to fill holes; operate in 29 other agencies throughout the Exec Branch and are many times responsible for keeping those agencies running.

	If your head is spinning while looking at this, just remember:

	The legislative branch *makes* laws (it’s in the name)

	The executive branch *carries out* laws (aka, executes laws, it’s in the name)

	The judicial branch *determines* if laws are constitutional (aka judges, it’s in the name)

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 18 _(2023-12-16 07:26:05)_

		The job of the judicial branch is to interpret and apply laws in resolving conflicts. Determining whether laws are constitutional occurs as a part of that much larger process. Some countries do specifically have constitutional courts for that purpose.

		> The judicial branch determines if laws are constitutional 
		
		It was established primarily just to adjudicate federal law. It was only Chief Justice John Marshall who brought it the principle of judicial review (i.e. determining if laws/actions are constitutional) in Marbury v Madison.

		* 🟧 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 4 _(2023-12-16 07:35:21)_

			It isn't really accurate to say that judicial review came about only with Marbury. It's clear from the ratification debates and Federalist papers that the framers understood that the Supreme Court would have the power of judicial review.

			* 🟦 **[SpockShotFirst](https://www.reddit.com/user/SpockShotFirst)** ⬆️ 5 _(2023-12-16 08:01:17)_

				The dudes who wrote the federalist papers were still around fifteen years later. They were kinda surprised at Marbury v Madison.  In fact, Marshall twisted himself in knots to rule in Adam's favor so that if Adam's accepted the ruling he would accept the concept of judicial review.
				
				In essence, the general concept of judicial review was somewhat acknowledged when it came to review of state action, but it was not clear that it covered acts of the federal government (legislative or executive action)

Or in other words, they thought congress would want to check and balance the president. But in fact congress tends to check and balance presidents of the other party and facilitate the goals of presidents in their own parties. So no they are not working

	One very cool and missing government sponsored corporation is In-Q-Tel, an

	American defense industry venture capital firm started in 1999. 

	In-Q-Tel (IQT), formerly Peleus and In-Q-It, is an American not-for-profit venture capital firm based in Arlington, Virginia. It invests in companies to keep the Central Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies, equipped with the latest in information technology in support of United States intelligence capability. The name "In-Q-Tel" is an intentional reference to Q, the fictional inventor who supplies technology to James Bond.

	Governance

	In-Q-Tel is a Virginia-registered corporation, legally independent of the CIA or any other government agency. The corporation is bound by its Charter agreement and annual contract with the CIA, which set out the relationship between the two organizations. In-Q-Tel's mission to support the Intelligence Community's technical needs is promoted by the In-Q-Tel Interface Center (QIC), an office within the CIA that facilitates communication and relationships between In-Q-Tel and government intelligence organizations. While In-Q-Tel is a nonprofit corporation, it differs from IARPA and other models in that its employees and trustees can profit from its investment. A Wall Street Journal investigation found that in 2016, nearly half of In-Q-Tel's trustees had a financial connection with a company the corporation had funded.

	Also missing is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is a Washington, D.C.–based scientific and regulatory agency within the United States Department of Commerce, a United States federal government department. The agency is charged with forecasting weather, monitoring oceanic and atmospheric conditions, charting the seas, conducting deep sea exploration, and managing fishing and protection of marine mammals and endangered species in the U.S. exclusive economic zone. It also services as the DoD's weather agency.

	Energy Information Administration whose office is inside Dept of energy hq building is technically under department of interior.  Bureau of labor statistics is technically not under Labor. Bureau of transportation statistics is not under DOT.  If it was up to me I’d have them stand alone with census as independent data agency.  

	Also missing….you have fed research centers thst are funded by the fed govt. their administration is done by feds but the scientists are not technically feds. They are a pseudo fed organization.  Some of these are

	&amp;#x200B;

	Oak Ridge national labs ( energy)

	JPL ( energy, nasa)

	Los Alamos ( energy)

	NCAR ( center for atmospheric research in Boulder, co) ( NOAA)

	MITRE is one of these but not tied to one or two fed agencies.  When you see a contractor from MITREbor one of these research centers….these are very different than a contractor from company like Northrop Grumman.

			2. Cannot spend more than authorized and the authorization comes from Congress. It’s hard to do stuff if you don’t pay the soldiers

			Local government should have more power than it does now, so this would empower them with less resources going to the federal government.  Local governments have everything they need already.

		The OCC is part of the Treasury Department, but you’re right that a lot of financial agencies are missing. The FDIC isn’t on there either. 
		
		There’s other errors as well, like the GAO is the Government Accountability Office (not the General Accounting Office).

	This is one of the worst representations of the us government I have seen. 

	1. it puts "the states" into a little corner that is barely visible. While in reality which state you live in has a huge impact on your life. Although less "sexy"  and notable, local politics is very often more important .

	2. This chart also seems to implicitly acknowledge the "3 coequal branches of government theory" Which sounds very nice but is an absolute fiction. The congress and senate are the most powerful (in theory) branch of government.  A Judge cannot remove a president from office by edict, a judge cannot remove remove a congressman from office by edict. A president cannot remove a judge from the bench by edict,  and a president cannot remove a member of congress from their position.  BUT congress and the senate can remove the president, remove a judge and remove members of  congress. So who do you think is really the most powerful.

		In what way? To run a nation this large, we need a large bureaucracy. Sure, we could reduce some of the agencies down but then they'd just be combined into larger agencies, who at the end of the day will still subdivide for different things. Having separate agencies allows for greater care for their particular area of expertise.
