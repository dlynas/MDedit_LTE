## “When pro-Israelis say “Palestinians rejected peace offers 8 times”, tell them this:

Israel has voted NO on 364 peace settlements w/ Palestine in the UN general assembly since 1947.

US has VETOED over 46 peace resolutions w/ Palestine in the UN Security Council since 1948.

WHAT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND:

Some “peace resolutions” are brokered by the world (in the UN). 

Others are brokered between 2-3 nations, like a “private” deal.

In the UN, Palestine has received overwhelming support by almost the entire world (>70% of voting nations in the UN), because the UN works through international law, and international law entirely backs the Palestinian cause and right of return.

This is why — since the 1970s — US/Israel has done everything in their power to veto and vote AGAINST resolutions in the UN GA and UNSC, and instead to broker “peace settlements” OUTSIDE the UN, instead via private deals, in which the world has no say and Palestine is on its own.

U.S/Israel are rogue states, by definition. They do not abide by international law. This is not a matter of opinion. Their literal voting record in the UNGA — and the US’s veto-record in the UNSC — are factual evidence that they openly defy international law.

That’s why every US-brokered “peace resolution” for Israel/Palestine — to which Palestinians have repeatedly agreed — 1) has given Palestinians drastically LESS rights, justice, and freedom than deals brokered in the UN, and 2) Israel has violated every one of those resolutions.”
