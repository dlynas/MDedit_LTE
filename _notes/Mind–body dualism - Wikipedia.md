[René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes")'s illustration of dualism. Inputs are passed on by the sensory organs to the [epiphysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland "Pineal gland") in the brain and from there to the immaterial spirit.

In the [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind"), **mind–body dualism** denotes either the view that [mental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind") phenomena are [non-physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-physical_entity "Non-physical entity"),<sup id="cite_ref-Hart_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Hart-1">[1]</a></sup> or that the [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind "Mind") and [body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body "Human body") are distinct and separable.<sup id="cite_ref-Crane2001p1_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Crane2001p1-2">[2]</a></sup> Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, as well as between [subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(philosophy) "Subject (philosophy)") and [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy) "Object (philosophy)"), and is contrasted with other positions, such as [physicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism "Physicalism") and [enactivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enactivism "Enactivism"), in the [mind–body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem "Mind–body problem").<sup id="cite_ref-Hart_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Hart-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Crane2001p1_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Crane2001p1-2">[2]</a></sup>

[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") shared [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato")'s view of multiple [souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_(spirit) "Soul (spirit)") and further elaborated a hierarchical arrangement, corresponding to the distinctive functions of plants, animals, and humans: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure, and desire that only humans and other animals share; and the faculty of reason that is unique to humans only. In this view, a soul is the [hylomorphic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylomorphism "Hylomorphism") of a viable organism, wherein each level of the hierarchy formally [supervenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervenience "Supervenience") upon the [substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory "Substance theory") of the preceding level. For Aristotle, the first two souls, based on the body, perish when the living organism dies,<sup id="cite_ref-Ari2_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Ari2-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Ari1_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Ari1-4">[4]</a></sup> whereas there remains an immortal and perpetual intellective part of mind.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> For Plato, however, the soul was not dependent on the physical body; he believed in [metempsychosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metempsychosis "Metempsychosis"), the migration of the soul to a new physical body.<sup id="cite_ref-Plat_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Plat-6">[6]</a></sup> It has been considered a form of reductionism by some philosophers, since it enables the tendency to ignore very big groups of variables by its assumed association with the mind or the body, and not for its real value when it comes to explaining or predicting a studied phenomenon.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

Dualism is closely associated with the thought of [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") (1641), who holds that the mind is a nonphysical—and therefore, non-spatial—substance. Descartes clearly identified the mind with [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") and self-awareness and distinguished this from the physical [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain "Brain") as the seat of [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence "Intelligence").<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-SEP-8">[8]</a></sup> Hence, he was the first documented Western philosopher to formulate the mind–body problem in the form in which it exists today.<sup id="cite_ref-De_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-De-9">[9]</a></sup> Dualism is contrasted with various kinds of [monism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism "Monism"). [Substance dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#Substance_dualism) is contrasted with all forms of [materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism "Materialism"), but [property dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism "Property dualism") may be considered a form of [emergent materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_materialism "Emergent materialism") or non-reductive physicalism in some sense.

## Types\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Types")\]

[Ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology "Ontology") dualism makes dual commitments about the nature of existence as it relates to mind and matter, and can be divided into three different types:

1.  _[Substance dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dualism "Substance dualism")_ asserts that mind and matter are fundamentally distinct kinds of foundations.<sup id="cite_ref-Hart_1-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Hart-1">[1]</a></sup>
2.  _[Property dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism "Property dualism")_ suggests that the ontological distinction lies in the differences between properties of mind and matter (as in [emergentism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergentism "Emergentism")).<sup id="cite_ref-Hart_1-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Hart-1">[1]</a></sup>
3.  _[Predicate dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_dualism "Predicate dualism")_ claims the irreducibility of mental predicates to physical predicates.<sup id="cite_ref-Hart_1-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Hart-1">[1]</a></sup>

### Substance or Cartesian dualism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Substance or Cartesian dualism")\]

**Substance dualism**, or **Cartesian dualism**, most famously defended by [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes"), argues that there are two kinds of foundation: mental and physical.<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-SEP-8">[8]</a></sup> Descartes states that the mental can exist outside of the body, and the body cannot think. Substance dualism is important historically for having given rise to much thought regarding the famous [mind–body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem "Mind–body problem").

The [Copernican Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism "Heliocentrism") and the scientific discoveries of the 17th century reinforced the belief that the scientific method was the unique way of knowledge. Bodies were seen as biological organisms to be studied in their constituent parts (materialism) by means of [anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy "Anatomy"), [physiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology "Physiology"), [biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry") and [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") (reductionism).<sup id="cite_ref-PMC_3115289_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-PMC_3115289-10">[10]</a></sup> Mind-body dualism remained the biomedical paradigm and model for the following three centuries.<sup id="cite_ref-PMC_3115289_10-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-PMC_3115289-10">[10]</a></sup>

Substance dualism is a philosophical position compatible with most [theologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology "Theology") which claim that immortal souls occupy an independent realm of existence distinct from that of the physical world.<sup id="cite_ref-Hart_1-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Hart-1">[1]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Disputed_statement" title="Wikipedia:Disputed statement"><span title="This claim has reliable sources with contradicting facts (November 2022)">disputed</span></a> <span>– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#Cartesian_dualism_may_not_be_compatible_with_most_theologies" title="Talk:Mind–body dualism">discuss</a></span></i>]</sup> In contemporary discussions of substance dualism, philosophers propose dualist positions that are significantly less radical than Descartes's: for instance, a position defended by [William Hasker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hasker "William Hasker") called Emergent Dualism<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> seems, to some philosophers, more intuitively attractive than the substance dualism of Descartes in virtue of its being in line with (_[inter alia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_alia "Inter alia"))_ evolutionary biology.

### Property dualism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Property dualism")\]

Property dualism asserts that an ontological distinction lies in the differences between properties of mind and matter, and that consciousness may be ontologically irreducible to [neurobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiology "Neurobiology") and physics. It asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e., in the way that living human bodies are organized), mental properties emerge. Hence, it is a sub-branch of [emergent materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergent_materialism "Emergent materialism"). What views properly fall under the _property dualism_ rubric is itself a matter of dispute. There are different versions of property dualism, some of which claim independent categorisation.<sup id="cite_ref-ist-socrates.berkeley.edu_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-ist-socrates.berkeley.edu-12">[12]</a></sup>

[Non-reductive physicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-reductive_physicalism "Non-reductive physicalism") is a form of property dualism in which it is asserted that all mental states are causally reducible to physical states. One argument for this has been made in the form of [anomalous monism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_monism "Anomalous monism") expressed by [Donald Davidson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davidson_(philosopher) "Donald Davidson (philosopher)"), where it is argued that mental events are identical to physical events, however, relations of mental events cannot be described by strict law-governed causal relationships. Another argument for this has been expressed by [John Searle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Searle "John Searle"), who is the advocate of a distinctive form of physicalism he calls [biological naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_naturalism "Biological naturalism"). His view is that although mental states are ontologically irreducible to physical states, they are [causally reducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality"). He has acknowledged that "to many people" his views and those of property dualists look a lot alike, but he thinks the comparison is misleading.<sup id="cite_ref-ist-socrates.berkeley.edu_12-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-ist-socrates.berkeley.edu-12">[12]</a></sup>

#### Epiphenomenalism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Epiphenomenalism")\]

Epiphenomenalism is a form of property dualism, in which it is asserted that one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states (both ontologically and causally irreducible). It asserts that while material causes give rise to [sensations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensation_(psychology) "Sensation (psychology)"), [volitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volition_(psychology) "Volition (psychology)"), [ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea "Idea"), etc., such mental phenomena themselves cause nothing further: they are causal dead-ends. This can be contrasted to [interactionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactionism_(philosophy_of_mind) "Interactionism (philosophy of mind)"), on the other hand, in which mental causes can produce material effects, and vice versa.<sup id="cite_ref-Rob_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Rob-13">[13]</a></sup>

### Predicate dualism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Predicate dualism")\]

**Predicate dualism** is a view espoused by such [non-reductive physicalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonreductive_physicalism "Nonreductive physicalism") as [Donald Davidson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davidson_(philosopher) "Donald Davidson (philosopher)") and [Jerry Fodor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Fodor "Jerry Fodor"), who maintain that while there is only one ontological category of substances and properties of substances (usually physical), the predicates that we use to describe mental events cannot be redescribed in terms of (or reduced to) physical predicates of natural languages.<sup id="cite_ref-Davidson_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Davidson-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

_Predicate dualism_ is most easily defined as the negation of _predicate monism_. **Predicate monism** can be characterized as the view subscribed to by [eliminative materialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliminative_materialism "Eliminative materialism"), who maintain that such intentional predicates as _believe_, _desire_, _think_, _feel_, etc., will eventually be eliminated from both the language of science and from ordinary language because the entities to which they refer do not exist. Predicate dualists believe that so-called "[folk psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_psychology "Folk psychology")," with all of its [propositional attitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_attitude "Propositional attitude") ascriptions, is an ineliminable part of the enterprise of describing, explaining, and understanding human mental states and behavior.

For example, Davidson subscribes to [anomalous monism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_monism "Anomalous monism"), according to which there can be no strict psychophysical laws which connect mental and physical events under their descriptions as _mental_ and _physical_ events. However, all mental events also have physical descriptions. It is in terms of the latter that such events can be connected in law-like relations with other physical events. Mental predicates are irreducibly different in character (rational, holistic, and necessary) from physical predicates (contingent, atomic, and causal).<sup id="cite_ref-Davidson_14-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Davidson-14">[14]</a></sup>

## Dualist views of mental causation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Dualist views of mental causation")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/DualismCausationViews3.svg/400px-DualismCausationViews3.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DualismCausationViews3.svg)

Four varieties of dualist causal interaction. The arrows indicate the direction of causations. Mental and physical states are shown in red and blue, respectively.

This part is about causation between properties and states of the thing under study, not its substances or predicates. Here a state is the set of all properties of what's being studied. Thus each state describes only one point in time.

### Interactionism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Interactionism")\]

Interactionism is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states. This is a position which is very appealing to common-sense intuitions, notwithstanding the fact that it is very difficult to establish its validity or correctness by way of [logical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") argumentation or empirical proof. It seems to appeal to common-sense because we are surrounded by such everyday occurrences as a child's touching a hot stove (physical event) which causes him to feel pain (mental event) and then yell and scream (physical event) which causes his parents to experience a sensation of fear and protectiveness (mental event) and so on.<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_8-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-SEP-8">[8]</a></sup>

### Non-reductive physicalism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Non-reductive physicalism")\]

Non-reductive physicalism is the idea that while there is one kind of substance (physical), it has two kinds of properties: mental and physical. Mental properties aren't reducible to physical properties, in that an ontological distinction lies in the differences between the properties of mind and matter. According to non-reductive physicalism all mental states may be causally reducible to physical states where mental properties map to physical properties and vice versa. A prominent form of non-reductive physicalism, called _[anomalous monism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomalous_monism "Anomalous monism")_, was first proposed by [Donald Davidson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Davidson_(philosopher) "Donald Davidson (philosopher)") in his 1970 paper "Mental events", in which he claims that [mental events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_event "Mental event") are identical with physical events, and that the mental is anomalous, i.e. under their mental descriptions these mental events are not regulated by strict [physical laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law").

### Epiphenomenalism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Epiphenomenalism")\]

[Epiphenomenalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomenalism "Epiphenomenalism") states that all mental events are caused by a physical event and have no physical consequences, and that one or more mental states do not have any influence on physical states. So, the mental event of deciding to pick up a rock ("_M1_") is caused by the firing of specific neurons in the brain ("_P1_"). When the arm and hand move to pick up the rock ("_P2_") this is not caused by the preceding mental event _M1_, nor by _M1_ and _P1_ together, but only by _P1_. The physical causes are in principle reducible to fundamental physics, and therefore mental causes are eliminated using this [reductionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionist "Reductionist") explanation. If P1 causes both _M1_ and _P2_, there is no [overdetermination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdetermination "Overdetermination") in the explanation for _P2_.<sup id="cite_ref-SEP_8-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-SEP-8">[8]</a></sup>

The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by [La Mettrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julien_Offray_de_La_Mettrie "Julien Offray de La Mettrie") (1745), and then by [Cabanis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Jean_George_Cabanis "Pierre Jean George Cabanis") (1802), and was further explicated by [Hodgson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadworth_Hodgson "Shadworth Hodgson") (1870) and [Huxley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.H._Huxley "T.H. Huxley") (1874).<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> [Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Cameron_Jackson "Frank Cameron Jackson") gave a [subjective argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#The_subjective_argument) for epiphenomenalism, but later rejected it and embraced [physicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism "Physicalism").<sup id="cite_ref-Jackson_2003_251_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Jackson_2003_251-17">[17]</a></sup>

### Parallelism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Parallelism")\]

Psychophysical parallelism is a very unusual view about the interaction between mental and physical events which was most prominently, and perhaps _only_ truly, advocated by [Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz "Gottfried Leibniz"). Like Malebranche and others before him, Leibniz recognized the weaknesses of Descartes' account of causal interaction taking place in a physical location in the brain. Malebranche decided that such a material basis of interaction between material and immaterial was impossible and therefore formulated his doctrine of [occasionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occasionalism "Occasionalism"), stating that the interactions were really caused by the intervention of God on each individual occasion. Leibniz's idea is that God has created a [pre-established harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-established_harmony "Pre-established harmony") such that it only seems _as if_ physical and mental events cause, and are caused by, one another. In reality, mental causes only have mental effects and physical causes only have physical effects. Hence, the term _parallelism_ is used to describe this view.<sup id="cite_ref-Rob_13-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Rob-13">[13]</a></sup>

### Occasionalism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Occasionalism")\]

[Occasionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occasionalism "Occasionalism") is a philosophical doctrine about causation which says that created substances cannot be efficient causes of events. Instead, all events are taken to be caused directly by God itself. The theory states that the illusion of efficient causation between mundane events arises out of a constant conjunction that God had instituted, such that every instance where the cause is present will constitute an "occasion" for the effect to occur as an expression of the aforementioned power. This "occasioning" relation, however, falls short of efficient causation. In this view, it is not the case that the first event causes God to cause the second event: rather, God first caused one and then caused the other, but chose to regulate such behaviour in accordance with general laws of nature. Some of its most prominent historical exponents have been [Al-Ghazali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali "Al-Ghazali"), [Louis de la Forge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_la_Forge "Louis de la Forge"), [Arnold Geulincx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Geulincx "Arnold Geulincx"), and [Nicolas Malebranche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Malebranche "Nicolas Malebranche").<sup id="cite_ref-Malebranche_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Malebranche-18">[18]</a></sup>

### Kantianism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Kantianism")\]

According to the philosophy of [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant "Immanuel Kant"), there is a distinction between actions done by desire and those performed by reason in liberty ([categorical imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative "Categorical imperative")). Thus, not all physical actions are caused either by matter alone or by freedom alone. Some actions are purely animal in nature, while others are the result of mind's free action on matter.

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: History")\]

### Ancient Greek philosophy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Ancient Greek philosophy")\]

[Hermotimus of Clazomenae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermotimus_of_Clazomenae "Hermotimus of Clazomenae") (fl. c. 6th century BCE) was a philosopher who first proposed the idea of mind being fundamental in the cause of change.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> He proposed that physical entities are static, while reason<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> causes the change. [Sextus Empiricus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Empiricus "Sextus Empiricus") places him with [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod"), [Parmenides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides "Parmenides"), and [Empedocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empedocles "Empedocles"), as belonging to the class of philosophers who held a dualistic theory of a material and an active principle being together the origin of the universe.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Similar ideas were expounded by [Anaxagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaxagoras "Anaxagoras").

In the dialogue _[Phaedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedo "Phaedo")_, [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato "Plato") formulated his famous [Theory of Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms "Theory of forms") as distinct and immaterial substances of which the objects and other phenomena that we perceive in the world are nothing more than mere shadows.<sup id="cite_ref-Plat_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Plat-6">[6]</a></sup>

In the _Phaedo_, Plato makes it clear that the Forms are the _universalia ante res_, i.e. they are ideal universals, by which we are able to understand the world. In his [allegory of the cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave "Allegory of the cave"), Plato likens the achievement of philosophical understanding to emerging into [the sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor_of_the_Sun "Metaphor of the Sun") from a dark cave, where only vague shadows of what lies beyond that prison are cast dimly upon the wall. Plato's forms are non-physical and non-mental. They exist nowhere in time or space, but neither do they exist in the mind, nor in the [pleroma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleroma "Pleroma") of matter; rather, matter is said to "participate" in form (μεθεξις, _[methexis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methexis "Methexis")_). It remained unclear however, even to Aristotle, exactly what Plato intended by that.

[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") argued at length against many aspects of Plato's forms, creating his own doctrine of [hylomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylomorphism "Hylomorphism") wherein form and matter coexist. Ultimately however, Aristotle's aim was to perfect a theory of forms, rather than to reject it. Although Aristotle strongly rejected the independent existence Plato attributed to forms, his [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics") do agree with Plato's _[a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori")_ considerations quite often. For example, Aristotle argues that changeless, eternal substantial form is necessarily immaterial. Because matter provides a stable substratum for a change in form, matter always has the potential to change. Thus, if given an eternity in which to do so, it _will_, necessarily, exercise that potential.

Part of Aristotle's _psychology_, the study of the soul, is his account of the ability of humans to reason and the ability of animals to perceive. In both cases, perfect copies of forms are acquired, either by direct impression of environmental forms, in the case of perception, or else by virtue of contemplation, understanding and recollection. He believed the mind can literally assume any form being contemplated or experienced, and it was unique in its ability to become a blank slate, having no essential form. As thoughts of earth are not heavy, any more than thoughts of fire are causally efficient, they provide an immaterial complement for the formless mind.<sup id="cite_ref-Ari2_3-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Ari2-3">[3]</a></sup>

### From Neoplatonism to scholasticism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: From Neoplatonism to scholasticism")\]

The philosophical school of [Neoplatonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism "Neoplatonism"), most active in Late Antiquity, claimed that the physical and the spiritual are both emanations of _the One_. Neoplatonism exerted a considerable influence on [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"), as did the philosophy of Aristotle via [scholasticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism "Scholasticism").<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

In the scholastic tradition of [Saint Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Thomas_Aquinas "Saint Thomas Aquinas"), a number of whose doctrines have been incorporated into Roman Catholic [dogma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma "Dogma"), the soul is the substantial form of a human being.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-auto-23">[23]</a></sup> Aquinas held the _Quaestiones disputate de anima_, or 'Disputed questions on the soul', at the Roman _studium provinciale_ of the [Dominican Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order "Dominican Order") at [Santa Sabina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Sabina "Santa Sabina"), the forerunner of the [Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, _Angelicum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifical_University_of_Saint_Thomas_Aquinas "Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas") during the academic year 1265–1266.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> By 1268 Aquinas had written at least the first book of the _Sententia Libri De anima_, Aquinas' commentary on Aristotle's _[De anima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Soul "On the Soul")_, the translation of which from the Greek was completed by Aquinas' Dominican associate at [Viterbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbo "Viterbo"), [William of Moerbeke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Moerbeke "William of Moerbeke") in 1267.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Like Aristotle, Aquinas held that the human being was a unified composite substance of two substantial principles: form and matter. The soul is the substantial form and so the first actuality of a material organic body with the potentiality for life.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

While Aquinas defended the unity of human nature as a composite substance constituted by these two inextricable principles of form and matter, he also argued for the incorruptibility of the intellectual soul,<sup id="cite_ref-auto_23-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-auto-23">[23]</a></sup> in contrast to the corruptibility of the vegetative and sensitive animation of plants and animals.<sup id="cite_ref-auto_23-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-auto-23">[23]</a></sup> His argument for the subsistence and incorruptibility of the intellectual soul takes its point of departure from the metaphysical principle that operation follows upon being (_agiture sequitur esse_), i.e., the activity of a thing reveals the mode of being and existence it depends upon. Since the intellectual soul exercises its own _per se_ intellectual operations without employing material faculties, i.e. intellectual operations are immaterial, the intellect itself and the intellectual soul, must likewise be immaterial and so incorruptible. Even though the intellectual soul of man is able to subsist upon the death of the human being, Aquinas does not hold that the human person is able to remain integrated at death. The separated intellectual soul is neither a man nor a human person. The intellectual soul _by itself_ is _not_ a human person (i.e., an individual _supposit_ of a rational nature).<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Hence, Aquinas held that "soul of St. Peter pray for us" would be more appropriate than "St. Peter pray for us", because all things connected with his person, including memories, ended with his corporeal life.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

The [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic "Catholic") doctrine of the [resurrection of the body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_resurrection "Universal resurrection") does not subscribe that, sees body and soul as forming a whole and states that at the [second coming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_coming "Second coming"), the souls of the departed will be reunited with their bodies as a whole person (substance) and witness to the [apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse "Apocalypse"). The thorough consistency between dogma and contemporary science was maintained here<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> in part from a serious attendance to the principle that there can be only one truth. Consistency with science, logic, philosophy, and faith remained a high priority for centuries, and a university doctorate in theology generally included the entire science curriculum as a prerequisite. This doctrine is not universally accepted by Christians today. Many believe that one's immortal soul goes directly to [Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven "Heaven") upon death of the body.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

### Descartes and his disciples\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Descartes and his disciples")\]

In his _[Meditations on First Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations_on_First_Philosophy "Meditations on First Philosophy")_, [René Descartes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") embarked upon a quest in which he called all his previous beliefs into doubt, in order to find out what he could be certain of.<sup id="cite_ref-De_9-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-De-9">[9]</a></sup> In so doing, he discovered that he could doubt whether he had a body (it could be that he was dreaming of it or that it was an illusion created by an evil demon), but he could not doubt whether he had a mind. This gave Descartes his first inkling that the mind and body were different things. The mind, according to Descartes, was a "thinking thing" ([Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language "Latin language"): _[res cogitans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_cogitans "Res cogitans")_), and an immaterial [substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory "Substance theory"). This "thing" was the essence of himself, that which doubts, believes, hopes, and thinks. The body, "the thing that exists" (_[res extensa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_extensa "Res extensa")_), regulates normal bodily functions (such as heart and liver). According to Descartes, animals only had a body and not a soul (which distinguishes humans from animals). The distinction between mind and body is argued in _Meditation_ VI as follows: I have a clear and distinct idea of myself as a thinking, non-extended thing, and a clear and distinct idea of body as an extended and non-thinking thing. Whatever I can conceive clearly and distinctly, God can so create.

The central claim of what is often called _Cartesian dualism_, in honor of Descartes, is that the immaterial mind and the material body, while being ontologically distinct substances, causally interact. This is an idea that continues to feature prominently in many non-European philosophies. Mental events cause physical events, and vice versa. But this leads to a substantial problem for Cartesian dualism: How can an immaterial mind cause anything in a material body, and vice versa? This has often been called the "problem of interactionism."

Descartes himself struggled to come up with a feasible answer to this problem. In his letter to [Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_of_Bohemia,_Princess_Palatine "Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine"), he suggested that spirits interacted with the body through the [pineal gland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland "Pineal gland"), a small gland in the centre of the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain "Brain"), between the two [hemispheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemispheres "Cerebral hemispheres").<sup id="cite_ref-De_9-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-De-9">[9]</a></sup> The term _Cartesian dualism_ is also often associated with this more specific notion of causal interaction through the pineal gland. However, this explanation was not satisfactory: _how_ can an immaterial mind interact with the physical pineal gland? Because Descartes' was such a difficult theory to defend, some of his disciples, such as [Arnold Geulincx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Geulincx "Arnold Geulincx") and [Nicolas Malebranche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Malebranche "Nicolas Malebranche"), proposed a different explanation: That all mind–body interactions required the direct intervention of [God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God "God"). According to these philosophers, the appropriate states of mind and body were only the _occasions_ for such intervention, not real causes. These [occasionalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occasionalism "Occasionalism") maintained the strong thesis that all causation was directly dependent on God, instead of holding that all causation was natural except for that between mind and body.<sup id="cite_ref-Malebranche_18-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Malebranche-18">[18]</a></sup>

### Recent formulations\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Recent formulations")\]

In addition to already discussed theories of dualism (particularly the Christian and Cartesian models) there are new theories in the defense of dualism. [Naturalistic dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_dualism "Naturalistic dualism") comes from Australian philosopher, [David Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers "David Chalmers") (born 1966) who argues there is an explanatory gap between objective and subjective experience that cannot be bridged by reductionism because consciousness is, at least, logically autonomous of the physical properties upon which it supervenes. According to Chalmers, a naturalistic account of property dualism requires a new fundamental category of properties described by new laws of [supervenience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervenience "Supervenience"); the challenge being analogous to that of understanding electricity based on the mechanistic and Newtonian models of materialism prior to [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations").

A similar defense comes from Australian philosopher [Frank Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Cameron_Jackson "Frank Cameron Jackson") (born 1943) who revived the theory of [epiphenomenalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomenalism "Epiphenomenalism") which argues that mental states do not play a role in physical states. Jackson argues that there are two kinds of dualism:

1.  _substance dualism_ that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances.
2.  _property dualism_ that says that body and soul are different _properties_ of the same body.

He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet). We can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but we will never know how the bat experiences that phenomenon.

## Arguments for dualism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Arguments for dualism")\]

Another one of Descartes' illustrations. The fire displaces the skin, which pulls a tiny thread, which opens a pore in the ventricle (F) allowing the "animal spirit" to flow through a hollow tube, which inflates the muscle of the leg, causing the foot to withdraw.

### The subjective argument\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: The subjective argument")\]

An important fact is that minds perceive intra-mental states differently from sensory phenomena,<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> and this cognitive difference results in mental and physical phenomena having seemingly disparate properties. The subjective argument holds that these properties are irreconcilable under a physical mind.

Mental events have a certain _subjective_ quality to them, whereas physical ones seem not to. So, for example, one may ask what a burned finger feels like, or what the blueness of the sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like.<sup id="cite_ref-Nag_32-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Nag-32">[32]</a></sup> Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events _[qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia "Qualia")._ There is something _that it's like_ to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are _qualia_ involved in these mental events. And the claim is that qualia cannot be reduced to anything physical.<sup id="cite_ref-Hart_1-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Hart-1">[1]</a></sup>

[Thomas Nagel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Nagel "Thomas Nagel") first characterized the problem of qualia for physicalistic monism in his article, "[What Is It Like to Be a Bat?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat%3F "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?")". Nagel argued that even if we knew everything there was to know from a third-person, scientific perspective about a bat's sonar system, we still wouldn't know what it is like to _be_ a bat. However, others argue that _qualia_ are consequent of the same neurological processes that engender the bat's mind, and will be fully understood as the [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_correlates_of_consciousness "Neural correlates of consciousness") develops.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>

[Frank Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Cameron_Jackson "Frank Cameron Jackson") formulated his well-known _[knowledge argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument "Knowledge argument")_ based upon similar considerations. In this [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment "Thought experiment"), known as [Mary's room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary%27s_room "Mary's room"), he asks us to consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in a black and white room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows everything there is to know about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

However, Jackson later rejected his argument and embraced [physicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism "Physicalism").<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> He notes that Mary obtains knowledge not of color, but of a new intramental state, _seeing color_.<sup id="cite_ref-Jackson_2003_251_17-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Jackson_2003_251-17">[17]</a></sup> Also, he notes that Mary might say "wow," and as a mental state affecting the physical, this clashed with his former view of [epiphenomenalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomenalism "Epiphenomenalism"). [David Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kellogg_Lewis "David Kellogg Lewis")' response to this argument, now known as the _ability_ argument, is that what Mary really came to know was simply the ability to recognize and identify color sensations to which she had previously not been exposed.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett "Daniel Dennett") and others also provide [arguments against this notion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary%27s_room#Objections "Mary's room").

### The zombie argument\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: The zombie argument")\]

The [zombie argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-zombie "P-zombie") is based on a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment "Thought experiment") proposed by [David Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers "David Chalmers") over the issue of [qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia "Qualia") or the [hard problem of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness "Hard problem of consciousness"). The basic idea is that one can imagine, and, therefore, conceive the existence of, an apparently functioning human being/body without any conscious states being associated with it.

Chalmers' argument is that it seems plausible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe and observe about a human being must be true of the zombie. None of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be described scientifically via [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") whether it is conscious or not. The mere logical possibility of a p-zombie demonstrates that consciousness is a natural phenomenon beyond the current unsatisfactory explanations. Chalmers states that one probably could not build a living p-zombie because living things seem to require a level of consciousness. However (unconscious?) robots built to simulate humans may become the first real p-zombies. Hence Chalmers half-joking calls for the need to build a "consciousness meter" to ascertain if any given entity, human or robot, is conscious or not.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

Others such as Dennett have [argued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie#Criticism "Philosophical zombie") that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent,<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> or unlikely,<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> concept. In particular, nothing proves that an entity (e.g., a computer or robot) which would perfectly mimic human beings, and especially perfectly mimic expressions of feelings (like joy, fear, anger, ...), would not indeed experience them, thus having similar states of consciousness to what a real human would have. It is argued that under [physicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism "Physicalism"), one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie is a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's.

### Special sciences argument\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Special sciences argument")\]

[Howard Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Robinson "Howard Robinson") argues that, if predicate dualism is correct, then there are "special sciences" that are irreducible to physics. These allegedly irreducible subjects, which contain irreducible predicates, differ from hard sciences in that they are interest-relative. Here, interest-relative fields depend on the existence of minds that can have interested perspectives.<sup id="cite_ref-Rob_13-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Rob-13">[13]</a></sup> [Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology") is one such science; it completely depends on and presupposes the existence of the mind.

Physics is the general analysis of [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature "Nature"), conducted in order to understand how the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe") behaves. On the other hand, the study of [meteorological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology") weather patterns or [human behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_science "Behavioral science") is only of interest to humans themselves. The point is that having a perspective on the world is a psychological state. Therefore, the special sciences presuppose the existence of minds which can have these states. If one is to avoid ontological dualism, then the mind that _has_ a perspective must be part of the physical reality to which it _applies_ its perspective. If this is the case, then in order to perceive the physical world as psychological, the mind must have a perspective on the physical. This, in turn, presupposes the existence of mind.<sup id="cite_ref-Rob_13-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Rob-13">[13]</a></sup>

However, [cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science "Cognitive science")<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> and [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology")<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> do not require the mind to be irreducible, and operate on the assumption that it has physical basis. In fact, it is common in science to presuppose a complex system;<sup id="cite_ref-chemistry_43-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-chemistry-43">[43]</a></sup> while fields such as [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"),<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"),<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> or [geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology "Geology")<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> could be verbosely expressed in terms of [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory "Quantum field theory"), it is convenient to use levels of abstraction like [molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecules "Molecules"), [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology) "Cell (biology)"), or the [mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology) "Mantle (geology)"). It is often difficult to decompose these levels without heavy analysis<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> and computation.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> Sober has also advanced philosophical arguments against the notion of irreducibility.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

### Argument from personal identity\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Argument from personal identity")\]

This argument concerns the differences between the applicability of [counterfactual conditionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_conditionals "Counterfactual conditionals") to physical objects, on the one hand, and to conscious, personal agents on the other.<sup id="cite_ref-MG_50-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-MG-50">[50]</a></sup> In the case of any material object, e.g. a printer, we can formulate a series of counterfactuals in the following manner:

1.  This printer could have been made of straw.
2.  This printer could have been made of some other kind of plastics and vacuum-tube transistors.
3.  This printer could have been made of 95% of what it is actually made of and 5% vacuum-tube transistors, etc..

Somewhere along the way from the printer's being made up exactly of the parts and materials which actually constitute it to the printer's being made up of some different matter at, say, 20%, the question of whether this printer is the same printer becomes a matter of arbitrary convention.

Imagine the case of a person, Frederick, who has a counterpart born from the same egg and a slightly [genetically modified sperm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_sperm "Genetically modified sperm"). Imagine a series of counterfactual cases corresponding to the examples applied to the printer. Somewhere along the way, one is no longer sure about the identity of Frederick. In this latter case, it has been claimed, _overlap of constitution_ cannot be applied to the identity of mind. As Madell puts it:<sup id="cite_ref-MG_50-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-MG-50">[50]</a></sup>

But while my present body can thus have its partial counterpart in some possible world, my present consciousness cannot. Any present state of consciousness that I can imagine either is or is not mine. There is no question of degree here.

If the counterpart of Frederick, Frederickus, is 70% constituted of the same physical substance as Frederick, does this mean that it is also 70% mentally identical with Frederick? Does it make sense to say that something is mentally 70% Frederick?<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> A possible solution to this dilemma is that of [open individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_individualism "Open individualism").

[Richard Swinburne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Swinburne "Richard Swinburne"), in his book _The Existence of God_, put forward an argument for mind-body dualism based upon personal identity. He states that the brain is composed of two hemispheres and a cord linking the two and that, as modern science has shown, either of these can be removed without the person losing any memories or mental capacities.

He then cites a thought-experiment for the reader, asking what would happen if each of the two hemispheres of one person were placed inside two different people. Either, Swinburne claims, one of the two is me or neither is—and there is no way of telling which, as each will have similar memories and mental capacities to the other. In fact, Swinburne claims, even if one's mental capacities and memories are far more similar to the original person than the others' are, they still may not be him.

From here, he deduces that even if we know what has happened to every single atom inside a person's brain, we still do not know what has happened to 'them' as an identity. From here it follows that a part of our mind, or our soul, is immaterial, and, as a consequence, that mind-body dualism is true.<sup id="cite_ref-SR_52-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-SR-52">[52]</a></sup>

### Argument from reason\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Argument from reason")\]

Philosophers and scientists such as [Victor Reppert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Reppert "Victor Reppert"), [William Hasker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hasker "William Hasker"), and [Alvin Plantinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga "Alvin Plantinga") have developed an argument for dualism dubbed the "argument from reason". They credit [C. S. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis "C. S. Lewis") with first bringing the argument to light in his book _[Miracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles_(book) "Miracles (book)")_; Lewis called the argument "The Cardinal Difficulty of Naturalism", which was the title of chapter three of _Miracles_.<sup id="cite_ref-Reppert_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Reppert-53">[53]</a></sup>

The argument postulates that if, as naturalism entails, all of our thoughts are the effect of a physical cause, then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. However, knowledge is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if naturalism were true, there would be no way of knowing it (or anything else), except by a fluke.<sup id="cite_ref-Reppert_53-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Reppert-53">[53]</a></sup>

Through this logic, the statement "I have reason to believe naturalism is valid" is inconsistent in the same manner as "I never tell the truth."<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> That is, to conclude its truth would eliminate the grounds from which to reach it. To summarize the argument in the book, Lewis quotes [J. B. S. Haldane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane "J. B. S. Haldane"), who appeals to a similar line of reasoning:<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>

> If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true...and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms.
> 
> — J. B. S. Haldane, _Possible Worlds_, p. 209

In his essay "Is Theology Poetry?", Lewis himself summarises the argument in a similar fashion when he writes:

> If minds are wholly dependent on brains, and brains on biochemistry, and biochemistry (in the long run) on the meaningless flux of the atoms, I cannot understand how the thought of those minds should have any more significance than the sound of the wind in the trees.

But Lewis later agreed with [Elizabeth Anscombe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Anscombe "Elizabeth Anscombe")'s response to his _Miracles_ argument.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> She showed that an argument could be valid and ground-consequent even if its propositions were generated via [physical cause and effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics) "Causality (physics)") by non-rational factors.<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Similar to Anscombe, [Richard Carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Carrier "Richard Carrier") and John Beversluis have written extensive objections to the [argument from reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_reason "Argument from reason") on the untenability of its first postulate.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup>

### Cartesian arguments\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Cartesian arguments")\]

Descartes puts forward two main arguments for dualism in _[Meditations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations_on_the_First_Philosophy "Meditations on the First Philosophy")_: firstly, the "modal argument," or the "clear and distinct perception argument," and secondly the "indivisibility" or "divisibility" argument.

<table><caption>Summary of the 'modal argument'<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup></caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="4">It is imaginable that one's mind might exist without one's body.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><i>therefore</i></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">It is conceivable that one's mind might exist without one's body.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><i>therefore</i></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">It is possible one's mind might exist without one's body.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><i>therefore</i></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">One's mind is a different entity from one's body.</td></tr></tbody></table>

The argument is distinguished from the [zombie argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_Argument "Zombie Argument") as it establishes that the mind could continue to exist without the body, rather than that the unaltered body could exist without the mind.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> [Alvin Plantinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga "Alvin Plantinga"),<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> [J. P. Moreland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Moreland "J. P. Moreland"),<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> and [Edward Feser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Feser "Edward Feser")<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> have both supported the argument, although Feser and Moreland think that it must be carefully reformulated in order to be effective.

The _indivisibility argument_ for dualism was phrased by Descartes as follows:<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>

> \[T\]here is a great difference between a mind and a body, because the body, by its very nature, is something divisible, whereas the mind is plainly indivisible…insofar as I am only a thing that thinks, I cannot distinguish any parts in me.… Although the whole mind seems to be united to the whole body, nevertheless, were a foot or an arm or any other bodily part amputated, I know that nothing would be taken away from the mind…

The argument relies upon [Leibniz'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz "Leibniz") [principle of the identity of indiscernibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles "Identity of indiscernibles"), which states that two things are the same if and only if they share all their properties. A counterargument is the idea that matter is not infinitely divisible, and thus that the mind could be identified with material things that cannot be divided, or potentially Leibnizian [monads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(philosophy) "Monad (philosophy)").<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>

## Arguments against dualism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Arguments against dualism")\]

### Arguments from causal interaction\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Arguments from causal interaction")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Dualism-vs-Monism.png/320px-Dualism-vs-Monism.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png)

Cartesian dualism compared to three forms of monism

One argument against dualism is with regard to causal interaction. If consciousness (_the mind_) can exist independently of physical reality (_the brain_), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One of the main objections to dualistic interactionism is lack of explanation of how the material and immaterial are able to interact. Varieties of dualism according to which an immaterial mind causally affects the material body and vice versa have come under strenuous attack from different quarters, especially in the 20th century. Critics of dualism have often asked how something totally immaterial can affect something totally material—this is the basic **problem of causal interaction**.

First, it is not clear _where_ the interaction would take place. For example, burning one's finger causes pain. Apparently there is some chain of events, leading from the burning of skin, to the stimulation of nerve endings, to something happening in the peripheral nerves of one's body that lead to one's brain, to something happening in a particular part of one's brain, and finally resulting in the sensation of pain. But pain is not supposed to be spatially locatable. It might be responded that the pain "takes place in the brain." But evidently, the pain is in the finger. This may not be a devastating criticism.

However, there is a second problem about the interaction. Namely, the question of _how_ the interaction takes place, where in dualism "the mind" is assumed to be non-physical and by definition outside of the realm of science. The _mechanism_ which explains the connection between the mental and the physical would therefore be a philosophical proposition as compared to a scientific theory. For example, compare such a mechanism to a physical mechanism that _is_ well understood. Take a very simple causal relation, such as when a cue ball strikes an eight ball and causes it to go into the pocket. What happens in this case is that the cue ball has a certain amount of momentum as its mass moves across the pool table with a certain velocity, and then that momentum is transferred to the eight ball, which then heads toward the pocket. Compare this to the situation in the brain, where one wants to say that a decision causes some neurons to fire and thus causes a body to move across the room. The intention to "cross the room now" is a mental event and, as such, it does not have physical properties such as force. If it has no force, then it would seem that it could not possibly cause any neuron to fire. However, with Dualism, an explanation is required of how something without any physical properties has physical _effects_.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>

[Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead "Alfred North Whitehead") and, later, [David Ray Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ray_Griffin "David Ray Griffin") framed a new ontology (_[process philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy "Process philosophy")_) seeking precisely to avoid the pitfalls of ontological dualism.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>

The explanation provided by [Arnold Geulincx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Geulincx "Arnold Geulincx") and [Nicolas Malebranche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Malebranche "Nicolas Malebranche") is that of [occasionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occasionalism "Occasionalism"), where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.

At the time [C. S. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis "C. S. Lewis") wrote _[Miracles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracles_(book) "Miracles (book)")_,<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") (and physical [indeterminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_indeterminacy "Quantum indeterminacy")) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, but still Lewis stated the logical possibility that, if the physical world was proved to be indeterministic, this would provide an entry (interaction) point into the traditionally viewed closed system, where a scientifically described physically probable/improbable event could be philosophically described as an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality. He states, however, that none of the arguments in his book will rely on this. Although some [interpretations of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics "Interpretations of quantum mechanics") consider [wave function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse "Wave function collapse") to be indeterminate, in others this event is defined as deterministic.<sup id="cite_ref-SEPQD_69-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-SEPQD-69">[69]</a></sup>

### Argument from language\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Argument from language")\]

[Colin Murray Turbayne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Murray_Turbayne "Colin Murray Turbayne") put forth an argument that the Mind-Body dualism codified within the Cartesian ontological system is particularly problematic on purely linguistic grounds. In Turbayne's view, Descartes' bifurcation of the [substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory "Substance theory") which presumably underlies reality as a whole into "[res cogitans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_cogitans "Res cogitans")" and "[res extensa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_extensa "Res extensa")" is more properly characterized as a prime example of a "category mistake" which is often associated with [metaphorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphorical "Metaphorical") constructs rather than an objective truth. Citing the work of [Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley "George Berkeley"), Turbayne holds that the Cartesian concepts of "substance" and "substratum" convey little if any meaning at best.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> He further argues that mankind's general acceptance of the mind-body dualism can be traced to an inadvertent use of deductive logic to incorporate "mechanistic" and "physicalist" metaphors from the works of both DesCartes and [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") into modern scientific hypotheses.<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hesse1966_73-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Hesse1966-73">[73]</a></sup> In short, Turbayne holds that as a result of a misguided and literal interpretation of the concepts underlying mind-body dualism, mankind has fallen victim to a metaphor which has taken on the guise of an objective scientific truth.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hesse1966_73-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Hesse1966-73">[73]</a></sup>

### Argument from physics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Argument from physics")\]

The argument from physics is closely related to the argument from causal interaction. Many [physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicists "Physicists") and consciousness researchers have argued that any action of a nonphysical mind on the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain "Brain") would entail the violation of physical laws, such as the [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy").<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup>

By assuming a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides to walk across a room, it is generally understood that the decision to do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person's brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his walking across the room. The problem is that if there is something totally non-physical _causing_ a bunch of neurons to fire, then there is no _physical_ event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe—this is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (repeatable experiment performed regarding) where the _physical_ energy for the firing came from.<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> Such interactions would violate the fundamental [laws of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law"). In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would violate the law of the [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy").<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> Dualistic interactionism has therefore been criticized for violating a general [heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic "Heuristic") principle of science: the [causal closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_closure "Causal closure") of the physical world.

The first reply is that the mind may influence the _distribution_ of energy, without altering its quantity. The second possibility is to deny that the human body is causally closed, as the [conservation of energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy "Conservation of energy") applies only to closed systems. However, physicalists object that no evidence exists for the causal non-closure of the human body.<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> Robin Collins responds<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> that energy conservation objections misunderstand the role of energy conservation in physics. Well understood scenarios in general relativity violate energy conservation and quantum mechanics provides precedent for causal interactions, or correlation without energy or momentum exchange.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> However, this does not mean the mind spends energy and, despite that, it still doesn't exclude the supernatural.

Another reply is akin to parallelism—Mills holds that behavioral events are causally [overdetermined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdetermination "Overdetermination"), and can be explained by either physical or mental causes alone.<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> An overdetermined event is fully accounted for by multiple causes at once.<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> However, [J. J. C. Smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._C._Smart "J. J. C. Smart") and [Paul Churchland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Churchland "Paul Churchland") have pointed out that if physical phenomena fully determine behavioral events, then by [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor "Occam's razor") an unphysical mind is unnecessary.<sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup>

Robinson suggests that the interaction may involve [dark energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy "Dark energy"), [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter") or some other currently unknown scientific process.<sup id="cite_ref-Rob_13-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Rob-13">[13]</a></sup> However, such processes would necessarily be physical, and in this case dualism is replaced with physicalism, or the interaction point is left for study at a later time when these physical processes are understood.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Another reply is that the interaction taking place in the human body may not be described by "billiard ball" [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"). If a nondeterministic interpretation of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") is correct then microscopic events are [indeterminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminism "Indeterminism"), where the degree of [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism") increases with the scale of the system. Philosophers [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper "Karl Popper") and [John Eccles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carew_Eccles "John Carew Eccles") and physicist [Henry Stapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stapp "Henry Stapp") have theorized that such indeterminacy may apply at the macroscopic scale.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> However, [Max Tegmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Tegmark "Max Tegmark") has argued that classical and quantum calculations show that [quantum decoherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence "Quantum decoherence") effects do not play a role in brain activity.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup> Indeed, macroscopic quantum states have only ever been observed in superconductors [near absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroscopic_quantum_state "Macroscopic quantum state").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2018)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Yet another reply to the interaction problem is to note that it doesn't seem that there is an interaction problem for all forms of substance dualism. For instance, [Thomistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomism "Thomism") dualism doesn't obviously face any issue with regards to interaction, for in this view the soul and the body are related as form and matter.<sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup>

### Argument from brain damage\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Argument from brain damage")\]

This argument has been formulated by [Paul Churchland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Churchland "Paul Churchland"), among others. The point is that, in instances of some sort of [brain damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage "Brain damage") (e.g. caused by automobile accidents, drug abuse, pathological diseases, etc.), it is always the case that the mental substance and/or properties of the person are significantly changed or compromised. If the mind were a completely separate substance from the brain, how could it be possible that every single time the brain is injured, the mind is also injured? Indeed, it is very frequently the case that one can even predict and explain the kind of mental or psychological deterioration or change that human beings will undergo when specific parts of their brains are damaged. So the question for the dualist to try to confront is how can all of this be explained if the mind is a separate and immaterial substance from, or if its properties are ontologically independent of, the brain.<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>

[Phineas Gage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage "Phineas Gage"), who suffered destruction of one or both frontal lobes by a projectile iron rod, is often cited as an example illustrating that the brain causes mind. Gage certainly exhibited some mental changes after his accident, suggesting a correlation between brain states and mental states. It has been noted, however, that Gage's most serious mental changes were only temporary,<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> and that he made a reasonable social and mental recovery.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup> The changes in question have almost always been distorted and exaggerated by scientific and popular literature, often relying on hearsay.<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup> Similar examples abound; neuroscientist [David Eagleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eagleman "David Eagleman") describes the case of another individual who exhibited escalating [pedophilic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophile "Pedophile") tendencies at two different times, and in each case was found to have tumors growing in a particular part of his brain.<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup>

Case studies aside, modern experiments have demonstrated that the relation between brain and mind is much more than simple correlation. By damaging, or manipulating, specific areas of the brain repeatedly under controlled conditions (e.g. in monkeys) and reliably obtaining the same results in measures of mental state and abilities, neuroscientists have shown that the relation between damage to the brain and mental deterioration is likely causal. This conclusion is further supported by data from the effects of neuro-active chemicals (e.g., those affecting [neurotransmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters "Neurotransmitters")) on mental functions,<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> but also from research on [neurostimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurostimulation "Neurostimulation") (direct electrical stimulation of the brain, including [transcranial magnetic stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation "Transcranial magnetic stimulation")).<sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup>

[Property dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism "Property dualism") and [William Hasker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hasker "William Hasker")'s "emergent dualism"<sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup> seek to avoid this problem. They assert that the mind is a property or substance that emerges from the appropriate arrangement of physical matter, and therefore could be affected by any rearrangement of matter.

Writing in the 13th century, St. [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") writes that "the body is necessary for the action of the intellect, not as it's origin of action." Thus, if the body is disfunctional, the intellect will not actualize as it intends to.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup> According to the philosopher [Stephen Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Stephen_Evans "C. Stephen Evans"):

> We did not need neurophysiology to come to know that a person whose head is bashed in with a club quickly loses his or her ability to think or have any conscious processes. Why should we not think of neurophysiological findings as giving us detailed, precise knowledge of something that human beings have always known, or at least could have known, which is that the mind (at least in this mortal life) requires and depends on a functioning brain? We now know a lot more than we used to know about precisely _how_ the mind depends on the body. However, _that_ the mind depends on the body, at least prior to death, is surely not something discovered in the 20th century."<sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup>

### Argument from biological development\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Argument from biological development")\]

Another common argument against dualism consists in the idea that since human beings (both [phylogenetically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenesis "Phylogenesis") and [ontogenetically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontogenesis "Ontogenesis")) begin their existence as entirely physical or material entities and since nothing outside of the domain of the physical is added later on in the course of development, then we must necessarily end up being fully developed material beings. There is nothing non-material or _mentalistic_ involved in conception, the formation of the [blastula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastula "Blastula"), the [gastrula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrula "Gastrula"), and so on.<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup> The postulation of a non-physical mind would seem superfluous.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Argument from neuroscience\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Argument from neuroscience")\]

In some contexts, the decisions that a person makes can be detected up to 10 seconds in advance by means of scanning their brain activity.<sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup> Subjective experiences and covert attitudes can be detected,<sup id="cite_ref-readstates_107-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-readstates-107">[107]</a></sup> as can mental imagery.<sup id="cite_ref-108"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup> This is strong [empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence "Empirical evidence") that [cognitive processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processes "Cognitive processes") have a physical basis in the brain.<sup id="cite_ref-Cognition_109-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Cognition-109">[109]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Dehaene_110-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Dehaene-110">[110]</a></sup>

### Argument from simplicity\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: Argument from simplicity")\]

The argument from simplicity is probably the simplest and also the most common form of argument against dualism of the mental. The dualist is always faced with the question of why anyone should find it necessary to believe in the existence of two, ontologically distinct, entities (mind and brain), when it seems possible and would make for a simpler thesis to test against scientific evidence, to explain the same events and properties in terms of one. It is a heuristic principle in science and philosophy not to assume the existence of more entities than is necessary for clear explanation and prediction.

This argument was criticized by [Peter Glassen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Glassen "Peter Glassen") in a debate with [J. J. C. Smart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._C._Smart "J. J. C. Smart") in the pages of _[Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_(journal) "Philosophy (journal)")_ in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<sup id="cite_ref-111"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup> Glassen argued that, because it is not a physical entity, [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor "Occam's razor") cannot consistently be appealed to by a physicalist or materialist as a justification of mental states or events, such as the belief that dualism is false. The idea is that Occam's razor may not be as "unrestricted" as it is normally described (applying to all qualitative postulates, even abstract ones) but instead concrete (only applies to physical objects). If one applies Occam's Razor unrestrictedly, then it recommends monism until pluralism either receives more support or is disproved. If one applies Occam's Razor only concretely, then it may not be used on abstract concepts (this route, however, has serious consequences for selecting between hypotheses _about_ the abstract).<sup id="cite_ref-Stanford_114-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-Stanford-114">[114]</a></sup>

This argument has  also been criticized by Seyyed Jaaber Mousavirad, who argues that the principle of simplicity could only be applied when there is no need for an additional entity. Despite arguments indicating the need for the soul, the principle of simplicity does not apply. Therefore, if there were no argument establishing the existence of the soul, one could deny its existence based on the principle of simplicity. However, various arguments have been put forth to establish its existence. These arguments demonstrate that while neuroscience can explain the mysteries of the material brain, certain significant issues, such as personal identity and free will, remain beyond the scope of neuroscience. The crux of the matter lies in the essential limitations of neuroscience and the potency of substance dualism in explaining these phenomena.<sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup>

Excerpt: "William Hasker (1999) goes one step further in arguing for the existence of the mind conceived as a non-composite substance which ‘emerges’ from the brain at a certain point in its development. He dubs his position ‘emergent dualism,’ and claims for it all the philosophical advantages of traditional, Cartesian substance dualism while being able to overcome a central difficulty, viz., explaining how individual brains and mental substances come to be linked in a persistent, ‘monogamous’ relationship. Here, Hasker, is using the term to express a view structurally like one (vitalism) that the British emergentists were anxious to disavow, thus proving that the term is capable of evoking all manner of ideas for metaphysicians."

Excerpt: "Perhaps scientists apply an unrestricted version of Occam's Razor to that portion of reality in which they are interested, namely the concrete, causal, spatiotemporal world. Or perhaps scientists apply a 'concretized' version of Occam's Razor unrestrictedly. Which is the case? The answer determines which general philosophical principle we end up with: ought we to avoid the multiplication of objects of whatever kind, or merely the multiplication of concrete objects? The distinction here is crucial for a number of central philosophical debates. Unrestricted Occam's Razor favors monism over dualism, and nominalism over platonism. By contrast, 'concretized' Occam's Razor has no bearing on these debates, since the extra entities in each case are not concrete".
