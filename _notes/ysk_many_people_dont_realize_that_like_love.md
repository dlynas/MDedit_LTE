## YSK - Many people don’t realize that like love languages, there are apology languages for people too. And it’s important to understand the apology language of the ones around you to be able to effectively apologize when you’re in the wrong.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/js5269/ysk_many_people_dont_realize_that_like_love/](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/js5269/ysk_many_people_dont_realize_that_like_love/)

> Why YSK: Knowing the apology language of your loved ones is very crucial. For instance, if your partner needs to hear an ‘I’m sorry’, giving them apology gifts will not work, and will cause rifts in your relationship.
> 
> Apology languages (from Gary Chapman and Jennifer Thompson)   
> 
> 1.Expressing regret : Verbalize your sorry, they need to hear from you that you understand that you wronged them, and that you feel bad and regret it. They want you to acknowledge that you’ve hurt them emotionally.  
> 
> 2.Accepting responsibility : drop the excuses. Own up to what you did. Don’t try to justify what you did, instead take responsibility and learn to be accountable for you hurting Someone else.  
> 
> 3.Making restitution : This is a more action oriented approach, where they know you’re making solid effort to not repeat your mistakes.  
> 
> 4.Genuinely repenting : this is where you can maybe explain why you did what you did, however it’s not a place to make excuses, instead they need to know that are willing to do whatever it takes to fix everything   
> 
> 5.Requesting forgiveness : this is very important step to most people, to ask their forgiveness and wait for it. It does not make you entitled to their forgiveness. Oftentimes people are unable to get over something without this step of closure, where you ask for and they give you closure.   
> 
>  Apologizing comes from emotional maturity and being able to be accountable for your actions, and how they affect other people. Being able to understand when you hurt another person and being able to apologize and do better is crucial.
> 
> EDIT : Do add what other kind of apology you would appreciate. And what kind of apology you know some of your loved ones need.
> So that we can all learn from each and other and become better people :)

	Personally, I'm more interested in the reasons for why someone did it, so that we can work together to prevent this kind of scenario in the future. 

	For example, people don't just have random violent outbursts. There is always a trigger, and finding this trigger and help prevent future outbursts.

		My wife on the other hand, has zero interest in my reasons why I did what I did. In fact it only comes across as excuse making, and frustrates her more. Meanwhile for me, part of my apology language is explaining the why, because I am trying to make sure the other person knows there was no malicious intent on my part

		* 🟧 **[TPTB_ThePowersThatBe](https://www.reddit.com/user/TPTB_ThePowersThatBe)** ⬆️ 1k _(2020-11-11 09:35:07)_

			I am also an explainer. Knowing why things happen is very important to me and I often go right into problem solving mode. One of the best lessons I learned in therapy is that the reasons why something happened are valid, but the injured person is not in a place to hear them until the injury itself has been validated from their point of view. You need to fully apologize and demonstrate that you understand the impact your action had on your wife BEFORE you explain why you did it and ask her to understand your perspective. Otherwise, it can sound like you are making excuses and not taking full accountability. The inference is that you are saying their pain is wrong and they shouldn’t have felt it. But they did feel it and they are feeling it so the disconnection between you only grows. You have to live in their world before showing them yours. Then, ideally, you can go back to sharing the same world.
			
			It helped me to think about it like a physical injury. If you accidentally cut your wife with a knife, you wouldn’t stand there saying it was accident while she’s bleeding. You’d help her to clean the wound and bandage it and then, after you know she’s okay, you might explain that you didn’t mean to be careless with the knife. Because the fact that it was an accident doesn’t mean you didn’t cut her.
			
			Remember, there is an emotional injury that you can’t see.

					I'm going to share this with my preschool and elementary students 😂 they should think about apologies more.... Parents and teachers demand the offender apologize bit it's not very thoughtful. So I think discussing what we can do to apologize helps. I often tell them "sometimes you have to apologize more than once" so saying "sometimes you have to apologize in different ways" builds on that more productively.

					Very glad it helped you. I was often accused of being a robot and I just couldn’t understand why this visibly upset person wasn’t immediately calmed by my infallible logic. Like you, I didn’t get to this understanding until my late thirties, but at least we got there, right?

						I feel like people who explain at length are just trying talking themselves into be right to justified in their actions or at the very least trying to talk until you’re tired of hearing about and forget it. I have a hard time with apologies that don’t include an action.

							That makes a lot of sense and I agree that apologies without supporting actions are meaningless. Having been on both sides of this, here is my perspective:
							
							Explainers think that logic and facts can erase the problem. They are looking for their actions to be understood and validated. 
							
							For non-explainers who might be more rooted in their emotions, the immediate need is for their feelings to be understood and validated.
							
							Combine these perspectives and you get mind-numbing circular conversations, which I think is what you’re describing when you say that explainers try to talk you into submission. And the reason is because you’re speaking different languages. You’re each trying to fix a different problem.
							
							Explainers need to remember that humans aren’t computers where errors can be deleted. No matter your intentions, the pain is real. Healing starts by acknowledging it fully not by minimizing it.

					Yes! As a teen I would hear, "I dont want any of your excuses." Of course then I would try yet another explanation! I would explain that Im not making excuses, Im just telling you why I did what I did. Which, to a person who doesnt want to hear anything remotely similar to an excuse... is an excuse.
					
					But in my head its valuable information! Now you know that I didnt intend to cause harm, and that Im aware of what Ive done and want to do better in the future.

				This is really true!! I'm the "angry wife" very often as well, because my SO is also very much an explainer. I'd really love to hear why he did what he did and work through it together, however he's got to make clear that he knows the seriousness of it all. Going straight to explaining really sounds like he's trying to rationalize it, and at that point I really don't care about the reasons/excuses because it doesn't make anything better.

				* 🟪 **[markarious](https://www.reddit.com/user/markarious)** ⬆️ 74 _(2020-11-11 10:32:01)_

					To be fair, this isn’t an end-all be-all. Sometimes my SO will get upset at me completely out of the blue. She’s hurt and she thinks I did something wrong before I even have a chance to explain the real context of what I’m saying OR before I even understand what she is saying to me. Being angry is not a way to live your life. It comes from her family and the fact that her dad will straight up attack her and TRY to hurt her when he realizes he’s said/done something cruel. “I’m hurt so my daughter needs to feel that hurt too.” She has realized I’m nothing like her dad and I have her best intentions in my heart. I would never hurt her intentionally and if I did you bet your ass I would be apologizing before trying to explain any of it. 
					
					She has worked on this a lot and it has done WONDERS for our relationship. Never assume your SO is being malicious to you on purpose. Always assume good intentions. It will go a long way. Now, if your SO is being malicious intentionally that’s a whole other bag of worms. 
					
					I’m not saying this applies to you per say. I just see the “I’m an angry wife Lolol!” a lot and it makes my stomach churn. It’s not really something to be proud of

				Because I am also an explainer, and this resonated so well with me and verbalized what I was doing wrong all this time with a certain important someone in my life that doesn’t want to  “hear [my] fucking excuses”.
				
				I always get so upset because it’s always in the heat of the moment (even if I’m not caught up in the same emotional level of heat); I don’t *feel* as though I’m making excuses — I’m just explaining myself because I want them to understand *why* I did it and how it looked to me.
				
				For me, I’d completely missed the inference that what they felt was wrong and they shouldn’t have felt it. The physical example with the knife really solidified this in my head; I’m also a visual learner, and with this, I was able to piece it together more clearly in my head: the pain they felt was real; they *did* feel it, and they *are* feeling it.
				
				The solution, to which — you truly said it best: I need to learn to live in their world before showing them mine; only then, ideally, we can go back to sharing the same one.
				
				AFTERTHOUGHT:
				As I was writing this, I was recollecting scenarios where I had been yelled at for making excuses, whilst feeling like I was simply explaining myself; it was then that I realized that I’m also a heavy apologizer for the other party: when I love them deeply and even if they’re still wrong, I make excuses *for* them.
				
				It bothered me because one of the scenarios I was recollecting was not real; it was an adulterated version of the real thing, that I fabricated in my head in order to cope with the memory and to forgive the one I love(d).
				
				It reminded me that I also need to learn to let go and let someone be wrong sometimes and not apologize *for* them; it reminded me that I still need to learn to walk away and just let some things or some people go.
				
				Because that day, I was not wrong. In fact, I had literally done nothing. But I was berated and abused for something they *thought* I did, that they passionately believed otherwise, and **refused** to hear me out. I don’t know if they were just projecting their own misdeeds or characteristics upon me or what, but it’s not my responsibility to make that excuse for them. And in reading this, I *almost* just blamed myself for the way they ~~re~~acted, when I remembered the *real* truth and that I, in fact, did not deserve to be treated that way that day. They were wrong; period.
				
				Anyway, here’s your Gold award for the better part of this read; I’m still an explainer and I still do need to learn to show empathy and allow time for healing before sitting there and s’plaining myself. Thank you again for a valuable life lesson — and for the subsequent unintentional second lesson in reminding myself that I’m not always in the wrong and that I don’t always have to apologize — especially when I’ve truly done nothing to need to.

					I feel like we are kindred spirits. I really relate to the communication challenges you described AND the tendency to overfunction doing the emotional labor of others.
					
					It is so hard to put your own need to clear the misunderstanding on hold. This was a huge challenge for me. Isn’t the goal to be rational? Why waste time feeling bad when it isn’t necessary?
					
					I wanted to jump right to the resolution to make myself feel better without doing the work to make them feel better....like me saying I didn’t mean it that way was the abracadabra that would magically erase the problem.
					
					Even if the other person is objectively “wrong,” their feelings are real. I’m so glad that my analogy helped you visualize it more clearly. And just because you join them in their world doesn’t always mean you think they are right. It’s not giving in. It simply means you think they are worthy of your attention and understanding. 
					
					As your afterthought proves, this doesn’t always work. Because sometimes the other person’s emotions have nothing to do with you. They might be projecting something completely unrelated onto you, which is incredibly difficult to navigate. 
					
					Lastly, thank you for the gold and for sharing your experience. ❤️

				This is really important. I had a flat mate who thought that in any conflict she just had to explain her reasons and her good intentions. She could not for the life of it accept that she still created problems and conflict despite good intentions and would even take it personal if you felt still annoyed by her. It made it impossible to ever solve anything.

				As someone who needs my partner to understand the impact of how they hurt me and recognize my feelings regarding the incident, your post truly resonates with me. My partner is an explainer as well, but when his apologies start with, “I’m sorry, but...” and proceed with an explanation, it often feels like he’s trying to excuse his behavior. I understand he is trying to explain why it happened, and I recognize the value, but if I’m hurt I need my feelings recognized and addressed before we can dive into the why. Otherwise it feels like there is a step missing in the process which makes me feel empty and invalidated, and in a way removes my perceived sincerity in the apology.

				* 🟪 **[TPTB_ThePowersThatBe](https://www.reddit.com/user/TPTB_ThePowersThatBe)** ⬆️ 3 _(2020-11-11 16:21:39)_

					I am so glad this helped give you some insight into the brain of the explainer. Your take hits home with me. I have frequently been guilty of “I’m sorry but...”  Of course you’re not going to feel heard and understood when the majority of his words are speaking to his experience instead of yours. 
					
					I don’t know your partner, but I bet he thinks he’s taking the most direct route to resolution. And he wants to “fix” your suffering by showing you it never needed to exist. It’s a noble objective, but an unrealistic one. (Unless he’s Superman and can fly around the world so quickly that it reverses time.) I think it’s incredibly promising that you are able to understand why explanation is important to him. And maybe this will help you to show him why it’s important to you for him to take the step of acknowledging your feelings. 
					
					I typed this on a different comment, but I thought I would share it with you as well: 
					
					Explainers think that logic and facts can erase the problem. They are looking for their actions to be understood and validated.

			I would assume that apology languages, like love languages, are ways that we can adapt how we communicate so that the other person understands us better. These languages are the things that work for them so that they can hear what they need from what we are saying. While learning about this kind of thing, think of what you can change so that they hear you better, not the things that you think you need to say so that you feel like you have "vented" sufficiently.

			My brain is constantly trying to find the origin of everything, so explaining why I do things a certain way comes hand-in-hand with my apology. I have become aware of the over-explaining, but it’s a very uncomfortable feeling when you know the other party sees this as an excuse.

				it's an intent thing, and a trust thing too. i think if someone habitually accuses you of trying to make excuses... that is an extreme red flag. a very bad cognitive distortion, in their mind, it's normal to tolerate someone acting in such a way. in reality, if someone is truly making excuses for something, that's nearly as bad as a lie. it really should be a really big deal. i've had to end freindships over this stuff, i realized eventually it was a really shitty thing to have to deal with, like being gaslit or something.

				I don't think that's entirely true.  The reason is why something happened.  An excuse is something that sounds like a reason, but it's not the *real* reason.  An excuse isn't why something happened, it's a plausible explanation you give to yourself or others to obscure the real reason.
				
				Eta: whether you believe what someone tells you is their reason is actually an excuse or not is an exercise for the viewer, but something actually being a reason or an excuse does have an objective reality.  That said, that reality may not be known even to the person who did the thing, humans are really good at misunderstanding their motivations and misremembering things.

		One of my biggest pet peeves with this general approach to apology is definitely "never try to explain yourself." No, man, reasons are important. I feel that way for two reasons.
		
		1. Like you said, the reason explains the behavior. I think people misunderstand that for "if I have a reason, you can't be mad at me." No. It's the work of both the person apologizing and the person hearing the apology to recognize that this is only added information, not a reason to let them off the hook. It's important for both parties to know that and act accordingly.
		2. An apology is first and foremost for the person you're apologizing to. But. It's also for the person apologizing. So they can take the first step to doing better next time. Explaining yourself when you've made a mistake helps you better understand why it happened. It helps you identify triggers and a behavior pattern. That's important for both you and the person you're speaking to to hear. Additionally, part of an apology is at least starting to purge the bad feelings that have built up from a specific event. The apologizer needs a chance to do this, too. Without being able to explain themselves, there's left behind, unresolved anger and frustration that can lead to a feeling like you're the downtrodden victim. That's not a healthy or helpful way to solve a problem. Arguably it will lead to a person who is less willing to apologize later.
		
		Of course when I say all this, I still believe that a straight-up "I'm sorry" is always going to be the most important first step. No explanations at the start. Just apologize and let the person who is hurt tell you why it hurt them. I personally feel it's really important to give them room to air out their bad feelings first and foremost. But after that, there needs to be room for the apologizer to speak up.
		
		Granted, all of this is based on my personal experiences and how I've felt on either end of the situation throughout my life. I recognize that how I see it is going to be different from how others see it. And I'm certainly not a licensed professional who can say this is backed up by data. I just know how I feel on the matter, and to me telling a person their explanation doesn't matter is pretty damaging.

			If you’re late to a meeting; “I’ll set my alarm earlier next time”. If you forgot an anniversary; “I’ll set a reminder on my calendar”. If you didn’t take a food allergy into account; “I’ll order something appropriate right now, and ask ahead of time next time” etc.

		OP explained the 5 of these super redundantly. They're more different and not applicable to every person/situation
		
		1) Expressing Regret is more emotional. This person wants to see that you *feel* the weight of your actions and how you hurt them. 
		
		2) Accepting responsibility is more like simply staying "I screwed up" and accepting your punishment with grace. Some people respect this a lot more than any emotional display.
		
		3) Making restitution is more like when you buy flowers after an argument. Some people just want to see a gesture that you care about them.
		
		4) Genuinely repenting is showing you understand fully exactly what you did wrong, and understand the steps to correct that behavior. 
		
		5) Requesting forgiveness is for the people who don't know how to come to you when you've hurt them. You gotta be the one to make the first move.
		
		If its a public apology, then yes, you need to do all 5. If its a mistake at work, you should focus on 2 and 4. If it's a personal relationship with an emotional person, you may need to focus more on 1, 3, and 5.

			I think it’s more about what part is more important to someone. Not that you shouldn’t do everything, but what really is important for someone. Personally if you hurt my feelings and don’t acknowledge that, but do everything else, I will have a hard time forgiving you. But if you recognize that you did and apologize, but don’t do anything else that will be probably enough for me. While I know people who find restitution to be the most important thing. I think that much like love languages it’s not that other things are not necessary or important, just some things resonate more with you.

None of these "languages" work independently as apologies, so I don't understand how this is a useful idea.

It's just the core components of a true apology, which is already pretty well established, and they do not work as separate entities.
		
		It would be better to look at the framing for this true apology: do you want it to be presented alongside gifts/reparations, do you want to hug it out, do you want it to be immediate or brought up as a separate conversation, do you want to hash out the details (how it happened + why it won't happen again) or do you want to move on quickly and only see the change happen without having to talk about it anymore, etc...

			I find myself giving and wanting to receive forgiveness, however, I don’t expect anyone to trust me until I have earned it.   I find myself forgiving freely and way sooner than I used to, even if the other party doesn’t ask for it or say they are sorry.   Trust takes much longer to build.   
			
			Ex: I forgive you.  (Notice there are no conditions)
			
			Once they express remorse and want to continue the relationship trust is discussed.

As the “apologizer” we have to be able to accept either outcome. Some people need time before they can accept an apology, and just because they can’t accept your apology now, doesn’t mean they won’t accept it later. The worst thing you can do is to insist someone accept an apology, or otherwise hijack that process and make it about you. Getting angry at someone for not accepting your apology is a surefire way to alienate them and make them feel you apology insincere.

		How is it frustrating? An apology is so basic if you make a mistake. You already know it's expected of you.
		
		If this is an issue for you, and you're also saying "it's not about saying 'sorry' all the time," maybe your understanding of what others generally expect isn't particularly accurate? You shouldn't feel frustrated when people expect an apology after you make a mistake.

			I’ll mention that sometimes a person didn’t make a mistake so much as they were in a position where the right thing to do also unfortunately hurt someone. This means that there isn’t a normal “accepting of responsibilty” or “promising to do differently.”  In that type of situation, often people won’t apologize, or they will offer a hollow apology. 
			
			But someone can still genuinely be sorry they hurt someone without implying they should have done differently and I think that’s a valuable lesson.

		I don't know where the idea came from, but broadly speaking there are different ways of expressing love and affection, and people are inclined to express their love for a partner in different ways, as well as needing different expressions of love from their partner.
		
		So some people advise couples to read up on love languages, and to have a discussion about the kinds of expressions they need or are meaningful to them.
		
		A few of the languages are touch, words of affirmation or gift giving. If someone feels very unloved because their partner doesn't touch them, that's gonna cause problems and essentially the point is to see how you can express your love for your partner in a way that it's received properly.

		This is funny but can really "dilute" the power of your apology. Conflict averse people twnd to apologize as a way to avoid thinking about the actual issue. To people around you it can just look like your apologizing as a routine and not because you actually want to.

			Yeah. I have a friend that overapologizes for everything so just getting a sorry isn't enough for me if I'm hurt. I want to hear a combination of 1 and 2 in this post, acknowledge how and why my feelings were hurt and take responsibility for it. I feel if you can't figure out how you hurt my feelings even after I tell you then there's no way you can avoid doing it in the future.

			My ex boyfriend would get mad at me for “making him feel bad.”  Nope, his bad behavior caused that guilt, I was just giving him a chance.  They’re essentially saying that your feelings are less important than theirs.

			I said this to another poster, but I feel we need to draw a line between "saying sorry" and actually "apologizing." 
			
			I'd argue that the actual meaning of "sorry" has just evolved beyond the strictest definition. It's taken on new implicit meanings, and is used in a range of different contexts to mean everything from "ignore me" to "can you please repeat yourself?" to "I acknowledge we're fighting and I don't necessarily think I was wrong but I would like to transition to makeup stage now if you are ready."
			
			I don't think that's a bad thing, it just means that "sorry" alone isn't enough if you're trying to make a "real" apology. But honestly, was it ever?

	Oh boy. I'm currently in a relationship where the other is very much not a responsibility taker and his frequent unfounded outbursts at me are not apologised for adequately (they are even blamed on me!). Every time one of them happens I get closer to ending things - because at some point it stops being emotional immaturity/low emotional intelligence and becomes outright abuse.

	Apologising readily and genuinely is not weakness as some perceive it to be. It's actually very character strengthening and creates positive consequence overall.

					I really like Carl Rogers approach to conflict resolution where each person must ensure they understand what the other person is literally saying, and what they mean before responding with their side of things. It's not easy but helps a lot, especially with 'difficult' people. 
					
					The latest thing this eejit flipped out over was, I shit you not, lunchboxes. I asked if his housemate had taken some of mine because certain size ones were missing and I wanted it for leftovers. He started yelling saying that I was "trying to sow bad seeds" in his mind of her, which is hilarious because he complains about her all the time (including about her using stuff of his and not returning it).

		Ugh I'm sorry to hear that that's even a thing you have to deal with right now. 
		
		
		I was raised by a mother like that. My unsolicited advice? The sooner you get out, the better, because it's been 30+ years with my mom and the closest I've *ever* gotten her to actually apologizing is "I'm sorry this happened to you". 
		
		
		Passive voice - she didn't do anything wrong, it just happened somehow! It's slightly better than "I'm sorry you feel that way"  - because that's some gaslighty bullshit right there - but it's not enough for me to want to continue to try to have a relationship with her. 
		
		Anyway, it absolutely *is* emotional abuse (whether it comes from low emotional intelligence/maturity or not, the fact remains that he is displaying abusive behavior). Speaking from experience, it'll wear you down the more he yells at you and then blames you for his actions.

			I'm sorry that you've had to put up with that from your mum. Parents are supposed to be an emotional bedrock, and it's a tragedy if that's not the case. 
			
			I've been estranged from my father and only sister for many years now, both because of exactly what the OP is about - total inability to take responsibility for their actions, and there is a lot of bad there to account for. My relationship with my mum is pretty much non existent because she thinks I'm overreacting, and should be the one to make amends.
			
			But, I agree with you - sooner you get out the better. It's sad not having any immediate family as such but I'd be so much more miserable if I was still subjecting myself to their toxic behaviour. Sometimes, even though it's not the nice thing, it's the right thing. So never feel guilty for helping yourself by removing people from your life, no matter who they are.

	For my SO and I, we both generally have the same apology language- showing remorse, and actively trying to get better to not do it again.

	What we've learned though, is that the specific words used in accepting the apology hold such different meaning for each other.

	For my SO- when someone apologizes, he always says "I forgive you". 

	I, on the other hand, only say "it's alright/okay/fine".

	He says that if the person accepting the apology doesn't say "I forgive you", he feels as though they actually don't, and makes it harder for him to do better. It doesn't feel genuinely accepted unless they say I forgive you.

	If someone says "I forgive you" to me, it makes me panic and feel that what I had done to upset them was actually much worse than I had thought. That's why "it's okay/etc" is what I use, since it feels less serious.

	I'm not sure why those words feel so harsh to me and so normal to him, but we have to be sure to accept apologies in each other's languages, otherwise the other person will feel unaccepted and find it difficult to do better.

	Without a doubt, this will be buried, but I'll share anyway. This is my step-by-step approach to the process you describe.

	1. Identification: You can't fix a problem until you identify it. This may come by way of someone else telling you how they feel about what you did or by a process of self-analysis.

	2. Apologize: Apologize in an open and authentic way. Explain what you did, and what the ramifications were. Take responsibility for what you've done.

	3. Redress: Make right what was wrong. If you broke someone's window, replace it. If you hurt someone's feelings, try to mend them. It won't always be possible, yet you should always try.

	4. Evolve: Change what caused you to make the mistake, to try to avoid making it again. The plan of this evolution should be communicated in the apology. We can often forgive almost any mistake...once. Try your best to not make the same mistakes over and over - and if you're completely successful, tell me how.

	To me a real apology includes 3 things:

	1.	Clear acknowledgement of what they did wrong. If they can’t explain what they did wrong then they don’t understand what they did wrong and will likely do it again.

	2.	Expressing remorse. Even if as simple as saying “I’m sorry.”

	3.	Explaining how they will handle future situations differently to result in a different outcome. This shows thoughtfulness and consideration.

	Bonus points: in life remember that it’s us against the problem, not us against one another. And that we all create problems on occasion without meaning to.

	To be honest, these apology languages seem like most if not all of them should be included in any apology. However, in my own experience, people can vary in the time and depth of apology they respond most constructively to.

	* Time: Some people are innately more likely to forgive and let go quickly, and probably appreciate a quick apology as well. Waiting longer can make them feel anxious or possibly even more hurt than they were in the first place. In very close types of relationships (best friends, spouses, immediate family if you’re close to them), these people are also the ones who tend to value upholding routine with the other person over holding onto negative feelings caused by the incident. They are less likely to hold grudges as long as the offense isn’t relationship-breaking and/or a repeated pattern or behavior, as long as they are not made to feel that their forgiving nature is taken for granted. They may actually feel worse about any distance and disruption put between you due to the incident than they feel about the offense in the first place.

	Example of how someone who responds well to a shorter-wait apology may feel: “Hey, I may still be a little upset about what happened, but at the end of the day I forgive you and we’re still going to do X activity like we do every day at this time. In fact, that quality time and routine is important and necessary for me to move past this and not hold onto anything.”

	Other people need time to cool down and process what has happened before they can engage and communicate in a constructive way. The time needed can be hours, days, or maybe longer depending on the nature of the offense. If someone tries to apologize too quickly for a major offense to them, it can even come off as superficial, as though the offender is only looking for immediate and obligatory forgiveness.

	Example of how someone who responds well to a longer-wait apology may feel: “Hey, I appreciate that you want to take responsibility and do better, but I’m going to need some space and alone time to cool down and process, so leave me be for a while. Give it a day or so, and I’ll come to you to talk about it when I’m ready.”

	* Depth: Some people want to hear an in-depth formal apology, where the apologizer goes into detail with accepting responsibility for the highly specific mistake or offense, and acknowledging what they did wrong (without trying to justify it). To them, this gesture shows a great deal of respect, humility, and responsibility, and it frames the apologizer as someone who is emotionally mature enough to be trusted to understand how/why they messed up and to do better going forward.

	Side note: this type of apology is almost always the best approach in the professional world, especially for a high-stakes offense.

	Example of how someone who responds well to a detailed apology may feel: “I see and acknowledge your thoughtfulness in crafting this apology. It speaks positively to your character that you realized your mistake, understood why it was a problem, and are committed to doing better in the future. As long as you are willing to put in the effort not to make that mistake again and to work hard to make up for it, we will move past this.”

	Other people would prefer a concise apology that has all the needed elements, even if some are implied (though every serious apology should include a clearly worded promise to do better in the future). A lengthy apology can even push them to feel like they need to console the offender (especially one who spends too many words making excuses) more than they feel that they gain closure from the offender crafting a lengthy statement. However, brief and casual should never mean insincere. Changed behavior over time tends to go miles farther with these individuals than words alone can.

	Example of how someone who responds well to a concise apology may feel: “Thank you for apologizing, and don’t worry about it too much. Just do X thing next time/don’t do Y thing again and we can move on.”

	Time and depth required can obviously vary a lot with each apology by the degree of screw-up on the offender’s behalf, the damage ultimately caused by it, and the relationship between the giver and receiver of the apology, so it’s not necessarily always this black and white. Needless to say, you shouldn’t need to wait three days and write up an essay for neglecting to do a minor household chore or accidentally calling an acquaintance the wrong name. Conversely, moving past an ugly and heated argument will probably take more than a few minutes and a one-sentence text regardless of each person’s apology language.

	That all said, I know myself to prefer a long cool-down time to clear my head after a heavy confrontation and work through some of my hurt before I’m genuinely open to hearing what the apologizer has to say (and hopefully with the goal of moving past it in the end). I’m also probably somewhere in the middle of the depth scale. I greatly appreciate when someone accepts responsibility for the offense and acknowledges that what they did has hurt or slighted me, and voices that they want to make a genuine effort to do better in the future. However, putting that into much more than the equivalent of a 3-5 sentence paragraph is probably going to make me feel a little awkward, even if the person doesn’t spend too long making excuses, unless it was something contentious enough to require that additional effort.

	Omg this makes so much sense! My husband and I both come from broken homes where we received empty apologies with no follow-through, so sorry doesn't mean much to either of us. Our apologies with each other are basically admitting fault, expressing regret, and then discussing what we will do or have done to move forward and correct the problem.

	Recently with some friends, my husband had an episode where he got very drunk, kind of blew up on everyone and stormed out, and then decided to walk a mile down the road at 2 am to get to the car and try to drive home (obviously I didn't let him get that far). It seemed to come out of nowhere. We took a 5 week break from our friends and through counseling he realized he his bipolar, suicidal, and had a lot of unresolved trauma to work through. He finally decided to let our friends know what happened and why, using the apology style that we use with each other.

	It wasn't well received because "he didn't actually say  the word sorry"

	Reading this makes me feel like my husband and I aren't crazy. So thank you!

	I most appreciate hearing that you've thought about it from my point of view and why that would/had upset me. My father will sometimes apologize (though more often he says I'm lying or that he doesn't remember doing it) but even if he does apologize, he immediately proves that he doesn't GET why doing X upset me. Like, he will turn 'doing X offensive thing' into a running joke, when 'doing X' means, for instance, 'not treating rape like a serious issue.' If they won't change and can't empathize, there's no ground at all on which to start fresh. To me it's like you can't share anything when there's no trust if it's because there's no overlapping worldview at all--if they won't agree that a hot stove can hurt your hand, man, you just have to walk away.

	Not everything needs to be broken down into 'languages'. Calling a person's sense of humor their laughter language wouldn't be useful - the way they joke should be already understood as part of their personality. An apology language is no different: apologizing right away, or not apologizing at all and just never doing the problematic thing again, or apologizing and still doing the thing - these are all aspects of different kinds of personalities. Be aware of them in the person you're addressing, but don't try to learn some kind of language because there isn't one.

	My apology language appears to be all but the last? Like, I want to hear "I'm sorry (1) for whatever I did (2), and here's how I'm going to make it up or fix it or do better (4)" and then they need to actually do better (3). That's also how I communicate. 

	I'm not big on gifts or asking forgiveness - I don't need to be appeased and I may not be ready to forgive yet so lemme do that on my own time. 

	Come to think of it, I do tend to clash with people who are vocal about forgiveness (either giving or receiving) because it's just not a priority for me.

	Edit: had 3 and 4 swapped

	I require physical touch. After a tiff or disagreement, I don’t feel ok until I get a good, long hug. Just to let me know that everything is going to be ok. I’m assuming that stems from my abandonment issues.

	A note that 'restitution' does not mean what is described above. Restitution would be paying for something that was broken, which is great. I would suggest you add the following line.

	* Make the necessary changes to insure you don't repeat the offending action.

	If that doesn't happen, then no amount of restitution, apology, regret, etc, is meaningful.

	Whoa man. Just yesterday at work I had a situation where I was arguing with a coworker about a piece of equipment. I thought one thing was wrong he thought another. He ended up being totally right. 

	Now I can be stubborn and self-righteous, and especially at work under normal circumstances I would have not conceded to being wrong. I would've been a little asshole and justified why I thought I was right blah blah. But randomly, I just decided I would own up to it and I told the guy he was right I was wrong. No excuses for why, I even apologized for assuming he was wrong. 

	Then seeing this post? It's got me all existential and I kind of feel like I've reached a turning point, if even a small one.

	Sorry for the rant and thanks if you took the time

	This is good advice. However, it sucks when you don’t know what you did wrong, and they refuse to tell you what you did. I hate that.

	I think another key issue is people who keep doing the same thing and show no signs of actual improvment as a human being. If you keep cheating or stealing or hurting or whatever bad thing you're doing that hurts people, yoour empty apologies mean nothing no matter how genuinely bad you feel because clearly you don't feel bad enough to change as a person.

	Or you can embrace the apology language of my co-worker - deny any wrong doing, claim it's the other person's fault for being offended then get angry because you are upset at him with no cause.  Force the other person to explain why they are angry over something that never happened.  This is the same strategy my father used as well.  I apologized to that man so many times in my life when he did something wrong.

	My wife pointed out that when I apologize I tend to walk it back. I say things like “I’m sorry but...” then rationalize why I may have said something offensive, etc. Honestly it’s been great feedback and I suggest everyone try to get more aware about these kinds of things because it’ll greatly improve your communication and relationships.

	This is a pretty eye opening post for me. I’ve always found it very easy to forgive people who express a desire to move forward, and so others asking for my forgiveness over and over has never felt too genuine to me. Other people have made me feel guilty in the past for forgiving people so fast, so knowing that apology languages are a thing definitely makes me feel better about that.

	This is incredibly important.  If two people can’t line up on this, your relationship will likely fail. 

	It’s important to me that my partner understands why I’ve been hurt by their actions. Simply apologizing and trying to move on leaves me feeling incredibly unsatisfied.

	I'm definitely number 4, but so many people think that explaining why you did wrong is an attempt to excuse it. Even worse sometimes people will ask why you did it, and as you answer they snap on you that "That's no excuse!" Yeah, I'm aware.

	Huh, this made me realize that I have absolutely no interest in being apologized to. Everything falls into one of two categories: water under the bridge, or bad/repeated enough that we're not going to be friends anymore.

	Is there any scientific basis for this? Because there certainly isn't any for 'love languages'... it's just pop-psychology gibberish.

	I need to hear why someone did something, but I also need to explain why what they did hurt me so that I feel we both understand where we stand. 

	Also, if it’s something that deeply upset me, I really need some kind of physically affection. Ideally this would be a hug, but holding my hand can help too. Idk it just helps me know that even if youre pissed at me you still love me (prob side affect of abusive parents)

	These are not really “types” of apology or different “languages” it’s more like the steps of an apology. 

	So, 2. Accept responsibility 

	1. Express regret

	5. Requests forgiveness 

	4. Repent

	3. (Where possible) make restitution 

	And of course the missing...don’t do it again Richard!

	I've noticed that asking someone to forgive you is more effective than repeatedly saying sorry. Asking the person to forgive you gives them agency in what is essentially a transaction.

	Parents need to teach their kids this. And kids need to teach their parents this. 

	I would especially like to add that many parents still think it’s okay to yell at their kids when they think the kids have done something to be “punished for.” Taking it to the point where your kids break down and cry from the mental stress is never okay. But apologizing afterwards and admitting you went too far? After 10 years, your kid will still love and respect you instead of resenting you/ growing distant.

	Thank you for this! It helps me understand my self. I think I prefer restitution and I get upset when people apologize but show no effort to change their behaviors. Especially in a work environment. If you are constantly apologizing for being late or missing a deadline, my respect for you will fall greatly and I will not accept your apologies.
