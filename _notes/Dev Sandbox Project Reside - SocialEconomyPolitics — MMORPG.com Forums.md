_Hi,  
_  
_I've undertaken a project of developing an indie MMO._  
_I do realize that this in itself has developed into a kind of laughingstock - but to be frank, I don't care._  
_I realize the magnitude of the project, and what it requires. It is not the first time I've seen code or worked on a project. I am aware of my limits.  
It is not a project that strives to be the "WoW killer" or "AAA Next-Gen Big Thang".  
_  
_To be fair, I never thought I'd actually do this, either - even when I've fantasized about it for countless times. Looking for an MMO to play, which would be... actually good and enticing, not yet another same-old with slightly different balance and skins. To recapture the essence that many of us have felt when we got caught by some of the first MMO's that we sunk into.  
_  
_But here I am, telling you that I've undertaken a project that is to develop an MMO._

##   
I've titled the project "**Reside**", core concepts of which are:

-   **Sandbox in nature**
-   **Sociocentric gameplay**
-   **Persistent, infinite world**
-   **Player-driven economy**
-   **Player-built housing and towns - in open-world**

## **But most importantly, I wish there to be a community-driven development around those features.**

What I mean by that is - I think that community is absolutely essential for such a project to succeed.  
And I think it is only logical to start growing and evolving that community as soon as possible.

I want the community to be able to express their opinions and ideas about where the game should develop, and have an open discussion about it.  
In return, I'll try my best to make it a reality, following the same generic philosophy of openness.

**I have just finished setting up a basic forum for the project, in order to hopefully form a community around the project that is able to achieve this goal.**  
**You can find it at** **[Reside.cf](http://reside.cf/)  
**  
I've made a couple of posts there discussing the project briefly, but certainly in more depth than in this post.

##   
**If you have any questions or advice, I am happy to answer and hear you out.**

Looking forward to hear your ideas and opinions.
