## [Resource] Political Campaign Software

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RunForIt/comments/ncier/resource_political_campaign_software/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunForIt/comments/ncier/resource_political_campaign_software/)

> [Campaign Partner](http://www.campaignpartner.com/) is a web-hosting/payment-processing option for the less-than-geeky. They cater mainly to state and local candidates and the company is run by a Redditor.
> 
> [NGP VAN](http://www.ngpvan.com/) is a software suite used by virtually every Democrat in Congress. It helps with everything from grassroots volunteer management to budgeting issues to filing with the FEC.
> 
> [DCCC1](http://www.dccc1.org/) is the version specifically for House candidates. (It is made by the same people as NGP and VAN.)
> 
> [GOTV](http://www.political-campaign-management-software.com/ct-Campaign-Optimizer.html) is an alternative that has a 30 day free trial.
> 
> [Backoffice](http://www.completecampaigns.com/) is a newer program specifically for the campaign process. These people give great customer support for people running their first campaigns. They also have a lot of [articles](http://www.completecampaigns.com/index.asp) that go into a lot more detail than my guides. It also has a free demo, but you need to email them.
> 
> [NationBuilder](http://nationbuilder.com/) is a cheaper alternative to all of the above mentioned. Its features include a web-side builder, voter database, web-based UI, mobile device support, bulk emails, and matrix-style volunteer management.
> 
> [CiviCRM](http://drupal.org/project/civicrm) is free and open-source. It is an outreach program. Features include a donor pledge program, online event registration and management, membership management, email blasts, etc. Also, it's all web-based and requires  [Drupal](http://drupal.org/). There is also a version for [Joomla!](http://www.joomla.org/).
> 
> [Piryx](http://piryx.com/) is actually a website, but it's dedicated to fundraising. How is it better than Paypal? It's not Paypal.
> 
> [VoterListsOnline](http://www.voterlistsonline.com/version2/site/page.asp?page_id=home) is a web-based program that allows you to search for lists of voters, filtered by demographic. To use the search function is free, but if you want the contact information for voters, you have to pay $.03 per voter.

	I've used NGP VAN extensively. It's great, but obviously you need a good list of potential donors for it to be useful. Contact other people who have run in your districts who might be friendly and ask them for their donor lists. Public disclosure forms leave a lot to be desired- especially phone numbers!

		DO NOT use public disclosure list to fundraise off of. That is illegal and you can go to jail. The public disclosure reports are peppered with fake names and if any of these fake names receive any solicitation you're going to jail.

			hahaha! How naive we are.

	Awesome!

		How much is it?

			I'm not sure, I think you may have to ask a salesperson. I just added some other alternatives into the text.

	I would like to comment in regards to the VoterListsOnline link. If you are a registered candidate you can get the voter list directly from the Board of Elections in your area for little to no money with the stipulation that you are only using it for the campaign. - Scala for Congress Staff

	In the Democratic party, you can ask your county chair for access to VAN. He may know it by a local name like VoteBuilder. If he's not a douche he should let you have an account since you're a candidate. This system has the most up to date information on voters in your district including how often other campaigns have bugged them.

	I would highly recommend [NationBuilder](http://nationbuilder.com/). It is cheap, effective, and open to people of every party.

	I've used it in a local race and for an advocacy group, and it is by far the best toolkit out there.

		Thanks, I added it to the top!

* 🟩 **[thegreathal](https://www.reddit.com/user/thegreathal)** ⬆️ 1 _(2011-12-16 01:28:30)_

	All good, also [CiviCRM](http://civicrm.org/) is an open-source campaign add-on for Drupal and Joomla.

	* 🟨 **[ajpos](https://www.reddit.com/user/ajpos) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2011-12-16 09:10:19)_

		Thanks! For some reason, the link is down. But I found some info on Drupal.org, which is now on the list. Did I get the description okay?

		* 🟧 **[thegreathal](https://www.reddit.com/user/thegreathal)** ⬆️ 1 _(2011-12-16 13:41:37)_

			Yup, good luck.
