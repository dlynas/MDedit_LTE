Trump’s dementia is a huge story that’s rapidly spreading. Bill Maher went there big tonight calling him a “neurological mess” & doing a sample political ad highlighting it. His condition is highly degenerative w/ cumulative brain damage. He’s badly deteriorating & changing daily

Bill Maher made a political ad for the Democrats! Honestly it’s the best one I’ve seen so far.  Democrats need to do more of this!! It will drive Trump bonkers!



Why is there laughter on this video? This behaviour is not funny In anyone.

Donald Trump has a woman problem.

In Wildwood he slurred and recovered just like this where he says “look” and then starts playing the accordion

Yes, but without the stupid laugh track.

Thoughts on how he’s going to hold up for the State of the Union? We going to get more short circuit moments when he’s trying to read off a teleprompter?

Problem is no one will do anything. I am convinced of that today.

What are the odds he actually appears for the SOTU? I say he won't.

This is incredible. Trump hangs on to his show business persona & of course he deplores being laughed at (remember Obama making fun of him at that infamous dinner). If this video gets around to where Trump sees it & knows people are laughing at him, it will push him over the edge

Then we will have 4 years like the last 4 Reagan years with his Alzheimer's only it sure won't be nancy running the country.more like McConnell

I’m sad that people are laughing. It’s not funny. It’s scary.

The question is will deterioration take him out before November

Okay but the tumbleweed 

Absolutely!! The more we talk about Trump's weaknesses the more he will lose his mind!! DO ANYTHING IT TAKES

Trump's condition cannot be hidden any longer. We have a right to know what's going on with his health. Trump is not fit to run for reelection, he can't even manage speaking engagements now.

I'm watching the rerun please add spoiler warnings in the future.

The problem is he may really be ill. He needs a medical evaluation more than to be laughed at. He may be a national security liability.
