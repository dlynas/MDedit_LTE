_**Inside Job**_ is a 2010 American [documentary film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film "Documentary film"), directed by [Charles Ferguson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ferguson_(filmmaker) "Charles Ferguson (filmmaker)"), about the [late-2000s financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis "2007–2008 financial crisis"). Ferguson, who began researching in 2008,<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Job_(2010_film)#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> said the film is about "the systemic corruption of the United States by the [financial services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services "Financial services") industry and the consequences of that systemic corruption",<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Job_(2010_film)#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> amongst them conflicts of interest of academic research, which led to improved disclosure standards by the [American Economic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Economic_Association "American Economic Association").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Job_(2010_film)#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> In five parts, the film explores how changes in the policy environment and banking practices helped create the financial crisis.

The film was acclaimed by film critics, who praised its pacing, research, and exposition of complex material. It was screened at the [2010 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Cannes_Film_Festival "2010 Cannes Film Festival") in May 2010 and, on February 27, 2011, won [Best Documentary Feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Documentary_Feature_Film "Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film") at the [83rd Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/83rd_Academy_Awards "83rd Academy Awards").

## Synopsis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inside_Job_(2010_film)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Synopsis")\]

The film begins by examining the effects of the government of [Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland "Iceland")'s shift toward [deregulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation "Deregulation") in 2000, which included the [privatization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization "Privatization") of its banks. When [Lehman Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers "Lehman Brothers") went bankrupt and [AIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_Group "American International Group") collapsed, Iceland and the rest of the world went into a global recession.

### Part I: How We Got Here\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inside_Job_(2010_film)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Part I: How We Got Here")\]

The American financial industry was regulated from 1941 to 1981, followed by a long period of deregulation. At the end of the 1980s, a [savings and loan crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis "Savings and loan crisis") cost taxpayers approximately $124 billion. In the late 1990s, the financial sector had consolidated into a few giant firms. In March 2000, the [Internet Stock Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble "Dot-com bubble") burst because investment banks promoted Internet companies they knew would fail, resulting in $5 trillion in investor losses. In the 1990s, [derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance) "Derivative (finance)") became popular in the industry and added instability. Efforts to regulate derivatives were thwarted by the [Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Modernization_Act_of_2000 "Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000"), backed by several key officials. In the 2000s, the industry was dominated by five investment banks ([Goldman Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs "Goldman Sachs"), [Morgan Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley "Morgan Stanley"), [Lehman Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers "Lehman Brothers"), [Merrill Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_(company) "Merrill (company)"), and [Bear Stearns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns "Bear Stearns")), two financial conglomerates ([Citigroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup "Citigroup"), [JPMorgan Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase "JPMorgan Chase")), three [securitized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitization "Securitization") insurance companies (AIG, [MBIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBIA "MBIA"), [AMBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambac "Ambac")) and [the three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(credit_rating_agencies) "Big Three (credit rating agencies)") rating agencies ([Moody's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody%27s_Investors_Service "Moody's Investors Service"), [Standard & Poor's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_Global_Ratings "S&P Global Ratings"), [Fitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitch_Ratings "Fitch Ratings")). Investment banks bundled mortgages with other loans and debts into [collateralized debt obligations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation "Collateralized debt obligation") (CDOs), which they sold to investors. Rating agencies gave many CDOs [AAA ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating "Bond credit rating"). [Subprime loans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_lending "Subprime lending") led to [predatory lending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_lending "Predatory lending"). Many home owners were given loans they could never repay.

### Part II: The Bubble (2001–2007)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inside_Job_(2010_film)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Part II: The Bubble (2001–2007)")\]

During the housing boom, the ratio of money borrowed by investment banks versus the banks' own assets reached unprecedented levels. Speculators could buy [credit default swaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap "Credit default swap") (CDSs), which were akin to an insurance policy, to bet against CDOs they did not own. Numerous CDOs were backed by subprime mortgages. Goldman-Sachs sold more than $3 billion worth of CDOs in the first half of 2006. Goldman also bet against the low-value CDOs, telling investors they were high-quality. The three biggest ratings agencies contributed to the problem, with AAA-rated instruments rocketing from a mere handful in 2000 to over 4,000 in 2006. There were some warnings about the growing risks in the financial system, including from [Raghuram Rajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghuram_Rajan "Raghuram Rajan"), then the chief economist of the [IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund"), who, at the [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve "Federal Reserve")'s 2005 [Jackson Hole conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Kansas_City#Economic_policy_symposium "Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City"), identified some risks and proposed policies to address them, though former [U.S. Treasury Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury "United States Secretary of the Treasury") [Lawrence Summers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers "Lawrence Summers") called his warnings "misguided" and Rajan himself a "[luddite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite#In_modern_thought "Luddite")".

### Part III: The Crisis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inside_Job_(2010_film)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Part III: The Crisis")\]

The market for CDOs collapsed and investment banks were left with hundreds of billions of dollars in loans, CDOs, and real estate they could not unload. The [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession "Great Recession") began in November 2007, and in March 2008, Bear Stearns ran out of cash. In September, the federal government took over [Fannie Mae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae "Fannie Mae") and [Freddie Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac "Freddie Mac"), which had been on the brink of collapse. Two days later, Lehman Brothers collapsed. These entities all had AA or AAA ratings within days of being bailed out. Merrill Lynch, on the edge of collapse, was acquired by [Bank of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America "Bank of America"). [Henry Paulson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Paulson "Henry Paulson") and [Timothy Geithner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Geithner "Timothy Geithner") decided that Lehman must go into bankruptcy, which resulted in a collapse of the [commercial paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_paper "Commercial paper") market. On September 17, the insolvent AIG was taken over by the government. The next day, Paulson and Fed chairman [Ben Bernanke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke "Ben Bernanke") asked Congress for $700 billion to bail out the banks. The [global financial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_financial_system "Global financial system") became paralyzed. On October 3, 2008, President [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush") signed the [Troubled Asset Relief Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program "Troubled Asset Relief Program"), but global stock markets continued to fall. Layoffs and foreclosures continued with unemployment rising to 10% in the US and the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union"). By December 2008, [GM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors "General Motors") and [Chrysler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler "Chrysler") also faced bankruptcy. Foreclosures in the U.S. reached unprecedented levels.

### Part IV: Accountability\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inside_Job_(2010_film)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Part IV: Accountability")\]

Top executives of the insolvent companies walked away with their personal fortunes intact and avoided prosecution. The executives had hand-picked their [boards of directors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors "Board of directors"), which handed out billions in bonuses after the government bailout. The major banks grew in power and doubled anti-reform efforts. Many academic economists who had advocated for deregulation for decades and helped shape U.S. policy still opposed reform after the 2008 crisis. Firms involved were the [Analysis Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_Group "Analysis Group"), [Charles River Associates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRA_International "CRA International"), [Compass Lexecon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_Lexecon "Compass Lexecon"), and the Law and Economics Consulting Group ([LECG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LECG_Corporation "LECG Corporation")). Many of these economists were paid consultants to companies and other groups involved in the financial crisis, conflicts of interest that were often not disclosed in their research papers.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Job_(2010_film)#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

### Part V: Where We Are Now\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inside_Job_(2010_film)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Part V: Where We Are Now")\]

Tens of thousands of U.S. factory workers were laid off. The incoming [Obama administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama "Presidency of Barack Obama")'s financial reforms were weak, and there was no significant proposed regulation of the practices of ratings agencies, lobbyists, or executive compensation. Geithner became Treasury Secretary. [Martin Feldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Feldstein "Martin Feldstein"), [Laura Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Tyson "Laura Tyson"), and [Lawrence Summers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers "Lawrence Summers") were all top economic advisers to Obama. Bernanke was reappointed [Chair of the Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve "Chair of the Federal Reserve"). European nations imposed strict regulations on bank compensation, but the U.S. resisted them.
