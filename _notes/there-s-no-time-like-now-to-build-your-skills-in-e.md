## There's no time like now to build your skills in effectively communicating, especially across difference.These are the main points from the workshop I've been leading on this topic. I hope they are helpful to you. 

Content co-creation with Rachel Gottfried-Clancy. Design by @monicaeunjikim . Questions in the Conversation Compass adapted from the book Crucial Conversations: tools for talking when the stakes are high

1. Tools for talking about Palestine with friends and family, especially across difference. It is possible to do this with more ease and effectiveness. These tools can help. 

2. Know your priorities. Clarity of priority or purpose can help you discern when, how, why, and whether or not to engage. Speak and act in ways that will move you towards your purpose. 
Reflection Questions: 
+ This moment is specific. What are your top 1-3 priorities right now? (ex: contributing to power-building efforts to bring about a permanent ceasefire ASAP)
+ What is tempting but NOT your priority right now? (ex: proving you are "right," venting anger or frustration, protecting your ego)

3. When emotional charge rises, orient yourself with this conversation compass that can help to guide your words and actions. 

Conversation compass questions: 
+ What are my bigger priorities in this moment? 
+ What do I want for myself?
+ What do I want for the other person? 
+ What do I want for this relationship?
+ What might I say or do to move towards what I want? What's going to be effective? 
+ What words and actions might I want to avoid, so that I can move towards what I want? What's tempting, but not effective? 

4. Do the unexpected: begin by listening
Listening to the other person first before reacting or diving in with your own opinions can build trust and open up possibilities. 

5. Slow down. Ground. As emotional charge increases, our conversations tend to get faster when we most need to slow down. Grounding and centering practices can help.
