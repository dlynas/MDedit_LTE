	That's because pro-Palestinian people by-and-large are morally consistent, because we can afford to be because our position is the more morally defensible. When pro-Israel people are unwilling to do the same, it shows their weakness. 

	When you're defending mass killings and trying to find clever (and not-so-clever) reasons why it's "nOt a GEnoCIdE", you've already lost the moral argument. The fact we're at the point where we're even having the debate about whether or not it's a genocide means you've gone way too far.

	I think also "Pro-Palestinian" doesn't mean Palestinian superiority or Palestinians should rule all the middle east or Palestinians have special rights over others. "Pro Palestinian" means anti settler, anti colonial, anti apartheid, anti genocide, objecting to all forms of racial, religious and cultural superiority. "Pro Palestinian" means Pro the most basic international laws protecting human rights and freedom from occupation

		Very good point. 
		Similar to how BLM doesn't mean black lives matter more. It means black lives matter too. 
		We're not demanding superior rights. We're demanding equal rights. Plain and simple.

			With BLM, I at first thought "I wish they had picked a better slogan because it's so frustrating to continually explain the point to the all lives matter crowd."
			
			Then I realized that it doesn't matter what is chosen because reactionaries will always twist it to find the most superficial, bullshit retort possible.

			That's a great analogy. People were so disingenuous with that all lives matter not just Black lives crap when it was clear as day for anyone who is thoughtful that there was a reason it needed to be said because Black lives aren't respected in our systems. It's that same disingenuousness when it comes to Israel except from liberals too.

					It is so goddamn frustrating to hear these tautological arguments over and over and over again. "War is war" "Ethnostate vs ethnostate means they're forced to do something against an ethnic group to win, so it will always be a genocide" YES! THAT'S THE POINT. You can't push a society to the brink and expect them to take it. Nobody gives up their future for another people and disappears quietly into oblivion. What the fuck are we even talking about?
					
					Really the answer is that all of these policies are products of unviable politics, dependent on moral hazards that make human suffering a side issue, human suffering that no community would stand, and they have no real answer on how to alleviate it for themselves or anyone else besides giving up. It is undoubtedly true that some elements of Palestinian side have become ethnically motivated, but that is only because Israel started an ethnocratic project. That was the point. They sieved particular ethnicities from Palestine and divided up the country along ethnic grounds, and now they're crying foul because it's untenable and hard to reconcile with any community's understanding of their natural rights.
					
					What is a sovereign nation supposed to do if it's ethnically divided, and inflicted an apartheid regime along borders that only suit its ethnosupremacist agenda, and then finds that those ethnicities happen to be attacked?! How are they supposed to defend themselves from these no longer natives! What would you do if they were fighting you? It's not possible to fight a multigenerational enemy without multigenerational harm! If they didn't live next to their children in the only land they had left and walked out into the three open fields we left them, we'd just bomb them in the fields instead! If they only moved on and let us destroy their identity, way of life, history, and negotiate themselves into oblivion, we'd have peace! By the way, Palestinian is just a made up ethnicity to punish us! Oh the humanity! We will never forgive them for making us kill their children, but war is war! If you have a better solution let us know!

					So.  The definition of genocide is wrong because what Israel is doing fits the definition of genocide.
					
					She is so close to understanding, but so far.

						That's what understood as well. If anything it's more infuriating than I remember on my second watch weeks later. But I think she is (unintentionally) revealing how these people are thinking when they default to their programming to support Israel no matter what. 
						
						This convention was crafted specifically to avoid a repeat of the crimes perpetrated against the Jewish people and others (and also to enjoin all nations to act to prevent such crimes, which they failed to do in the 30s and 40s). It doesn't compute to these people that it can now be applied to the crimes of a self-described "Jewish nation", even when it's right there for all to see. It would be pitiable if it weren't also so monstrous.

				* 🟪 **[rainbowslimejuice](https://www.reddit.com/user/rainbowslimejuice)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-05-01 06:59:41)_

					I might be missing something but why is the "in part" what she is hung up on? I think you'd have to go pretty far back in history to find an ethnic group that was literally wiped out. Even the holocaust didn't kill every Jewish person. Or am I misunderstanding this?
					
					Also, the intentionality is key. The intent of the actions being to destroy a people (even if in part) as opposed to meet some other military objective that resulted in people being killed.
					
					One might not think it applies here because of intent (I would strongly disagree as would some key Israeli figures leading their government) but the "in part" part seems like a strange thing to debate.

	This is silly to even discuss though because fascists, as Sartre says, don’t care about words. All the work to use the right words and they waste our time and energy.

		This is probably why so-called diplomacy has failed for the past 75 years and has instead just bought Israel more and more time to slowly annex more land and displace more Palestinians.

* 🟩 **[TipzE](https://www.reddit.com/user/TipzE)** ⬆️ 12 _(2024-04-30 19:15:42)_

	It's because pro-palestine people aren't some ideological hive mind.

	They are normal people outraged by war crimes. The way normal people are.

	In short, they see the evidence of the crimes, and they are outraged (the natural response; the consequence of the actions).

	So saying "i condemn hamas" and "i condemn israel" isn't some form of mental gymnastics. It's just what they believe because they don't like the violence.

	---

	The zionists on the other hand are going the other way around.

	They want to commit genocide. They want to do ethnic cleansing (one of their common talking points is "why don't all the other countries take in the palestinians" - ie, help them ethnically cleanse them).

	And being the ones with power, they are the ones who have the say in where this goes.

	But they're not about to say "we want to commit a genocide and nothing you say will deter us from it".

	So they have to try and lean on rhetorical devices and put the entirety of the justification onto those who are the actual ones doing the responding ("have you condemned hamas?")

	If they admit they've gone too far, or say there's a limit to how many civilians should die, or admit that they're in control of what's going on, or acknowledge any of the war crimes they're doing (even tacitly), they then have to start defending their stance.

	And their stance is innately an indefensible one.

	Because wanting genocide and ethnic cleansing is the stance of a monster.

	What doesn't make sense to me, just regarding the self defense argument. If Israel is hunting hamas because hamas killed 3k innocent people. So rightfully Israel is hunting them down, but in the process they have killed over 100k innocent people. So by their own metric, they are worse than hamas.
