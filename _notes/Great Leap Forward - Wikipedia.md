The **Great Leap Forward** was an economic and social campaign within the [People's Republic of China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") (PRC) from 1958 to 1962, led by the [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party") (CCP). [Party Chairman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party "Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party") [Mao Zedong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong") launched the campaign to reconstruct the country from an [agrarian economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_society "Agrarian society") into an [industrialized society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_society "Industrial society") through the formation of [people's communes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_commune "People's commune"). Mao decreed that efforts to multiply grain yields and bring industry to the countryside should be increased. Local officials were fearful of [Anti-Rightist Campaigns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Rightist_Campaign "Anti-Rightist Campaign") and they competed to fulfill or over-fulfill quotas which were based on Mao's exaggerated claims, collecting non-existent "surpluses" and leaving farmers to starve to death. Higher officials did not dare to report the economic disaster which was being caused by these policies, and national officials, blaming bad weather for the decline in food output, took little or no action. Millions of people died in China during the Great Leap, with estimates ranging from 15 to 55 million, making the [Great Chinese Famine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine "Great Chinese Famine") the largest or second-largest<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> famine in [human history](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history "Human history").<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:1_3-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:1-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:3_4-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:3-4">[4]</a></sup>

The major changes which occurred in the lives of rural Chinese people included the incremental introduction of mandatory [agricultural collectivization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_farming "Collective farming"). Private farming was prohibited, and those people who engaged in it were persecuted and labeled [counter-revolutionaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_to_Suppress_Counterrevolutionaries "Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries"). Restrictions on rural people were enforced with public [struggle sessions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denunciation_rally "Denunciation rally") and social pressure, and [forced labor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labour "Forced labour") was also exacted from people.<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky_5-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky-5">[5]</a></sup> Rural industrialization, while officially a priority of the campaign, saw "its development ... aborted by the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward".<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> The Great Leap was one of two periods between 1953 and 1976 in which [China's economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China "Economy of China") shrank.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Economist [Dwight Perkins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_H._Perkins_(economist) "Dwight H. Perkins (economist)") argues that "enormous amounts of investment only produced modest increases in production or none at all. ... In short, the Great Leap \[Forward\] was a very expensive disaster".<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

In 1959, Mao Zedong ceded day-to-day leadership to pragmatic moderates like Chinese President [Liu Shaoqi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi "Liu Shaoqi") and Vice Premier [Deng Xiaoping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping "Deng Xiaoping"), and the CCP studied the damage that was done at conferences which it held in 1960 and 1962, especially at the "[Seven Thousand Cadres Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Thousand_Cadres_Conference "Seven Thousand Cadres Conference")". Mao did not retreat from his policies; instead, he blamed problems on bad implementation and "rightists" who opposed him. He initiated the [Socialist Education Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Education_Movement "Socialist Education Movement") in 1963 and the [Cultural Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution "Cultural Revolution") in 1966 in order to remove opposition and re-consolidate his power. In addition, dozens of dams constructed in [Zhumadian, Henan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhumadian "Zhumadian"), during the Great Leap Forward collapsed in 1975 (under the influence of [Typhoon Nina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Nina_(1975) "Typhoon Nina (1975)")) and resulted in the [1975 Banqiao Dam failure](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Banqiao_Dam_failure "1975 Banqiao Dam failure"), with estimates of its death toll ranging from tens of thousands to 240,000.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_9-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:2-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

## Background [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")

[Classical Marxist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Marxism "Classical Marxism") theory hypothesized a relatively linear progression of development and a worldwide revolution beginning with the most developed countries.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 145">: 145 </span></sup>  At the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the country was one of poorest in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 147">: 147 </span></sup>  The Great Leap Forward attempted to defy the conventional understanding of the time required for economic development.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 146">: 146 </span></sup>  Through rapid industrialization, it aimed to close the gap between China's developmental stage and its political aspirations.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 146">: 146 </span></sup>  In March 1955, at a national conference of the Party, Mao declared that China "would catch up with and surpass the most powerful capitalist countries in several dozen years", and in October, Mao announced that he would complete the building of a socialist state in 15 years.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

The too-ambitious goals of the Great Leap Forward were based in part on strong economic performance during [China's first five-year plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_five-year_plan_(China) "First five-year plan (China)").<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Pages: 147–148">: 147–148 </span></sup>  During that period, agricultural and industrial production increased at double digit rates and the plan's production goals were fulfilled ahead of schedule.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 158">: 158 </span></sup> 

### Agricultural collectives and other social changes [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Agricultural collectives and other social changes")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sending_officials_to_the_countryside.jpg)

Government officials being sent to work in the countryside, 1957

Before 1949, peasants had farmed their own small pockets of land and observed traditional practices—festivals, banquets, and paying homage to ancestors.<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky_5-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky-5">[5]</a></sup> It was realized that Mao's policy of using a [state monopoly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_monopoly "State monopoly") on agriculture to finance industrialization would be unpopular with the peasants. Therefore, it was proposed that the peasants should be brought under Party control by the establishment of agricultural [collectives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective "Collective") which would also facilitate the sharing of tools and draft animals.<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky_5-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky-5">[5]</a></sup>

This policy was gradually pushed through between 1949 and 1958 in response to immediate policy needs, first by establishing "mutual aid teams" of 5–15 households, then in 1953 "elementary agricultural cooperatives" of 20–40 households, then from 1956 in "higher co-operatives" of 100–300 families. From 1954 onward peasants were encouraged to form and join collective-farming associations, which would supposedly increase their efficiency without robbing them of their own land or restricting their livelihoods.<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky_5-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky-5">[5]</a></sup>

By 1958, private ownership was abolished and all households were forced into state-operated communes. Mao demanded that the communes increase grain production to feed the cities and to earn foreign exchange through exports.<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky_5-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky-5">[5]</a></sup>

Apart from progressive taxation on each household's harvest, the state introduced a system of compulsory state purchases of grain at fixed prices to build up stockpiles for famine-relief and meet the terms of its trade agreements with the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"). Together, taxation and compulsory purchases accounted for 30% of the harvest by 1957, leaving very little surplus. Rationing was also introduced in the cities to curb 'wasteful consumption' and encourage savings (which were deposited in state-owned banks and thus became available for investment), and although food could be purchased from state-owned retailers the market price was higher than that for which it had been purchased. This too was done in the name of discouraging excessive consumption.

Besides these economic changes, the Party implemented major social changes in the countryside including the banishing of all religious and mystic institutions and ceremonies, replacing them with political meetings and propaganda sessions. Attempts were made to enhance rural education and the status of women (allowing them to initiate divorce if they desired) and ending [foot-binding](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-binding "Foot-binding"), [child marriage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage "Child marriage") and [opium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium "Opium") addiction. The old system of internal passports (the _[hukou](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system "Hukou system")_) was introduced in 1956, preventing inter-county travel without appropriate authorization. Highest priority was given to the urban [proletariat](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat "Proletariat") for whom a [welfare state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state "Welfare state") was created.

The first phase of collectivization resulted in modest improvements in output.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Famine along the mid-Yangzi was averted in 1956 through the timely allocation of food-aid, but in 1957 the Party's response was to increase the proportion of the harvest collected by the state to insure against further disasters. Moderates within the Party, including [Zhou Enlai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Enlai "Zhou Enlai"), argued for a reversal of collectivization on the grounds that claiming the bulk of the harvest for the state had made the people's food-security dependent upon the constant, efficient, and transparent functioning of the government.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Hundred Flowers Campaign and Anti-Rightist Campaign [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Hundred Flowers Campaign and Anti-Rightist Campaign")

In 1957, Mao responded to the tensions which existed in the Party by launching the [Hundred Flowers Campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign "Hundred Flowers Campaign") as a way to promote free speech and criticism. Some scholars have retroactively concluded that this campaign was a ploy designed to allow critics of the regime, primarily intellectuals but also low ranking members of the party who were critical of the agricultural policies, to identify themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

By the time of the completion of the first 5 Year Economic Plan in 1957, Mao had come to believe that the path to socialism that had been followed by the Soviet Union was not appropriate for China. He was critical of [Khrushchev's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev "Nikita Khrushchev") reversal of [Stalinist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism "Stalinism") policies and he was also alarmed by the uprisings that had taken place in [East Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uprising_of_1953_in_East_Germany "Uprising of 1953 in East Germany"), [Poland](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozna%C5%84_1956_protests "Poznań 1956 protests") and [Hungary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956 "Hungarian Revolution of 1956"), and the perception that the USSR was seeking "[peaceful coexistence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_coexistence "Peaceful coexistence")" with the Western powers. Mao had become convinced that China should follow its own path to communism. According to [Jonathan Mirsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Mirsky "Jonathan Mirsky"), a historian and a journalist who specialized in Chinese affairs, China's isolation from most of the rest of the world, along with the [Korean War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War "Korean War"), had accelerated Mao's attacks on his perceived domestic enemies. It led him to accelerate his designs to develop an economy where the regime would get maximum benefit from rural taxation.<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky_5-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky-5">[5]</a></sup>

The [Anti-Rightist Campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Rightist_Campaign "Anti-Rightist Campaign") started on June 8th, 1957. The main goal was to purge "rightists" from the communist party and China altogether. It was believed that approximately 5 percent of the population was still "rightists" (Political conservatives sabotaging the revolution).<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

### Rash advance movement and anti-rash advance movement [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Rash advance movement and anti-rash advance movement")

In the early years of the New China, due to the lack of experience in financial and economic work, it was a common practice to include the fiscal surplus of the previous year in the budget of the current year. Because of the low level of budgeting in the fiscal sector and inaccurate estimates of economic development, revenues and expenditures were underestimated. However, no problems arose because the government usually managed to end the fiscal year with a surplus. In 1953, when China entered the first five-year plan period, the Chinese economy had improved and the [Ministry of Finance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China "Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China") still decided to include the fiscal surplus of the previous fiscal year as credit funds in the 1953 budget revenue to cover the current year's expenditures. As a result, budget expenditures were expanded and so was the size of the budget. At that time, only the Soviet expert Kutuzov warned the Chinese fiscal authorities not to use the fiscal surplus of the previous year, however, it was not heeded by the Ministry of Finance. In that year, the gross industrial and agricultural output grew by 21.3%, while the capital construction budget increased by 50% compared to the previous year, which led to an imbalance between production and demand. Such was the "small rash advance" (小冒進) at the start of the first five-year plan period.<sup id="cite_ref-eco1_15-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-eco1-15">[15]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 127–128">: 127–128 </span></sup>  The issue had caused widespread social controversy. The faction of [Li Xiannian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Xiannian "Li Xiannian"), [Chen Yun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yun "Chen Yun") and others did not think it was appropriate to continue this practice, but they also had opponents. Li Xiannian finally decided to hold a collective meeting to discuss the issue, and after listening to the views of all parties, he decided to abolish the practice.<sup id="cite_ref-eco1_15-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-eco1-15">[15]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 129">: 129 </span></sup> 

Nevertheless, the controversy over the use of the fiscal surplus persisted, which brought another reckless "rash advance" to China's economic development in 1956. At that time, China lacked consideration in three areas: capital construction, employee wages and agricultural loans, making the central treasury tight again. This drew the attention of Zhou Enlai, Li Xiannian and others, and at a state meeting held on June 5, 1956, proposals were made to curb impetuousness and rash advances, revise the 1956 national economic plan, and cut capital construction investment. Such was the anti-"rash advance" movement.<sup id="cite_ref-eco1_15-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-eco1-15">[15]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 130–131">: 130–131 </span></sup> 

The excess of the first five-year plan gave the nation great confidence, and at the Second Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee, "go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" ([simplified Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters "Simplified Chinese characters"): 鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义; [traditional Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters "Traditional Chinese characters"): 鼓足幹勁、力爭上游、多快好省地建設社會主義) was adopted as the "General Line for Socialist Construction" in China.<sup id="cite_ref-eco2_16-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-eco2-16">[16]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 2">: 2 </span></sup>  In 1955, Mao had already expressed his belief that socialist construction should achieve "greater, faster, better, and more economical" results. These led to the re-emergence of "rash advances", which further led to the reintroduction of policies and tendencies that had previously been overturned. Those who opposed Mao's policies were accused of not upholding the tenets of the "class struggle" under people's [cult of Mao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_Mao "Cult of Mao").<sup id="cite_ref-eco2_16-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-eco2-16">[16]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 3–9, 20">: 3–9, 20 </span></sup> 

### Initial goals [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Initial goals")

Regarding agriculture, the Chinese government recognized the country's dilemma of feeding its rapidly growing population without the means to make significant capital improvements in agriculture.<sup id="cite_ref-:122_17-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:122-17">[17]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 82">: 82 </span></sup>  Viewing human labor as an underutilized [factor of production](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production "Factors of production"), the government intensified the mobilization of masses of people to increase labor inputs in agriculture.<sup id="cite_ref-:122_17-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:122-17">[17]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 82">: 82 </span></sup> 

In November 1957, party leaders of communist countries gathered in Moscow to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the [October Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution"). [Soviet Communist Party First Secretary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union "General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union") [Nikita Khrushchev](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev "Nikita Khrushchev") proposed not only to catch up with but exceed the United States in industrial output in the next 15 years through peaceful competition. Mao Zedong was so inspired by the slogan that China put forward its own one: to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in 15 years. As with its approach to agriculture, the Chinese government attempted to compensate for its inability to invest in industry with mass mobilizations to increase human labor inputs.<sup id="cite_ref-:122_17-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:122-17">[17]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 82">: 82 </span></sup> 

The initial projects of the Great Leap Forward were accelerating the construction of waterworks on the [North China Plain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China_Plain "North China Plain") during the 1957-1958 winter and next the development of people's communes and crude forms of rural industrialization.<sup id="cite_ref-:122_17-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:122-17">[17]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 82">: 82 </span></sup>  Some Great Leap Projects had lots of long-term value to China's economy and continued to benefit China after The Great Leap Forward ended.

## Organizational and operational factors [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Organizational and operational factors")

The Great Leap Forward campaign began during the period of the Second [Five Year Plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_plans_of_China "Five-year plans of China") which was scheduled to run from 1958 to 1963, though the campaign itself was discontinued by 1961.<sup id="cite_ref-glossary_19-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-glossary-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Mao unveiled the Great Leap Forward at a meeting in January 1958 in [Nanjing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing "Nanjing").

The Great Leap Forward was grounded in a logical theory of economic development and represented an unambiguous social invention.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> The central idea behind the Great Leap was that China should "walk on two legs", by rapidly developing both heavy and light industry, urban and rural areas, and large and small scale labor.<sup id="cite_ref-:022_22-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:022-22">[22]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 44">: 44 </span></sup>  The hope was to industrialize by making use of the massive supply of cheap labour and avoid having to import heavy machinery. The government also sought to avoid both social stratification and technical bottlenecks involved in the Soviet model of development, but sought political rather than technical solutions to do so.

An experimental commune was established at Chayashan in [Henan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henan "Henan") in April 1958. Here for the first time private plots were entirely abolished and communal kitchens were introduced. At the [Politburo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China "Politburo of the Communist Party of China") meetings in August 1958, it was decided that these people's communes would become the new form of economic and political organization throughout rural China. By the end of the year approximately 25,000 communes had been set up, with an average of 5,000 households each. The communes were relatively self-sufficient co-operatives where wages and money were replaced by work points.

The commune system was aimed at maximizing production for provisioning the cities and constructing offices, factories, schools, and social insurance systems for urban-dwelling workers, cadres, and officials. Citizens in rural areas who criticized the system were labeled "dangerous". Escape was also difficult or impossible, and those who attempted were subjected to "party-orchestrated public struggle", which further jeopardized their survival.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Besides agriculture, communes also incorporated some light industry and construction projects.

An earthen blast furnace, October 1958

Mao saw grain and steel production as the key pillars of economic development. He forecast that within 15 years of the start of the Great Leap, China's industrial output would surpass that of the UK. In the August 1958 Politburo meetings, it was decided that steel production would be set to double within the year, most of the increase coming through backyard steel furnaces.<sup id="cite_ref-Chan2001_26-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Chan2001-26">[26]</a></sup> Major investments in larger state enterprises were made: 1587, 1361 and 1815 medium and large-scale state projects were started in 1958, 1959 and 1960 respectively, more in each year than in the first Five Year Plan. <sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

Millions of Chinese became state workers as a consequence of this industrial investment: in 1958, 21 million were added to non-agricultural state payrolls, and total state employment reached a peak of 50.44 million in 1960, more than doubling the 1957 level; the urban population swelled by 31.24 million people.<sup id="cite_ref-Lardy368_28-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Lardy368-28">[28]</a></sup> These new workers placed major stress on China's food-rationing system, which led to increased and unsustainable demands on rural food production.<sup id="cite_ref-Lardy368_28-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Lardy368-28">[28]</a></sup> Those between the ages of sixteen and thirty were considered ideal candidates for the militia.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Backyard furnaces in the countryside, 1958

The Great Leap Forward sought to revive folk technologies, including in the area of steel production.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 168">: 168 </span></sup>  [China's steel industry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_industry_in_China "Steel industry in China") faced a shortage of imported iron and calls to increase production of "native iron" had begun in 1956.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 168">: 168 </span></sup>  By mid-1958, the Chinese state began promoting indigenous metallurgical methods and the proliferation of "folk furnaces".<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 168">: 168 </span></sup> 

Mao was shown an example of a backyard furnace in [Hefei](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hefei "Hefei"), [Anhui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui "Anhui"), in September 1958 by provincial first secretary [Zeng Xisheng](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeng_Xisheng "Zeng Xisheng").<sup id="cite_ref-Zhi-Sui2011_30-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Zhi-Sui2011-30">[30]</a></sup> The unit was claimed to be manufacturing high quality steel.<sup id="cite_ref-Zhi-Sui2011_30-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Zhi-Sui2011-30">[30]</a></sup>

Huge efforts on the part of illiterate peasants and other workers were made to produce steel out of scrap metal. To fuel the furnaces, the local environment was denuded of trees and wood taken from the doors and furniture of peasants' houses. Pots, pans, and other metal artifacts were requisitioned to supply the "scrap" for the furnaces so that the wildly optimistic production targets could be met. Many of the male agricultural workers were diverted from the harvest to help the iron production as were the workers at many factories, schools, and even hospitals. Although the output consisted of low quality lumps of [pig iron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_iron "Pig iron") which was of negligible economic worth, Mao had a deep distrust of intellectuals, engineers and technicians who could have pointed this out and instead placed his faith in the power of the mass mobilization of the peasants.

Moreover, the experience of the intellectual classes following the [Hundred Flowers Campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign "Hundred Flowers Campaign") silenced those aware of the folly of such a plan. According to his private doctor, [Li Zhisui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Zhisui "Li Zhisui"), Mao and his entourage visited traditional steel works in [Manchuria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria "Manchuria") in January 1959 where he found out that high quality steel could only be produced in large-scale factories using reliable fuel such as coal. However, he decided not to order a halt to the backyard steel furnaces so as not to dampen the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The program was only quietly abandoned much later in that year.

### Irrigation [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Irrigation")

Substantial effort was expended during the Great Leap Forward on a large-scale, but too often in the form of poorly planned capital construction projects, such as irrigation works built without input from trained engineers. Mao was well aware of the human cost of these water conservancy campaigns. In early 1958, while listening to a report on irrigation in Jiangsu, he mentioned that:

> Wu Zhipu claims he can move 30 billion cubic metres; I think 30,000 people will die. Zeng Xisheng has said that he will move 20 billion cubic metres, and I think that 20,000 people will die. Weiqing only promises 600 million cubic metres, maybe nobody will die.<sup id="cite_ref-Dikotter33_31-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Dikotter33-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Weiqing421_32-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Weiqing421-32">[32]</a></sup>

Though Mao "criticized the excessive use of [corvée](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corv%C3%A9e "Corvée") for large-scale water conservancy projects" in late 1958,<sup id="cite_ref-MacFarquhar150_33-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-MacFarquhar150-33">[33]</a></sup> mass mobilization on irrigation works continued unabated for the next several years, and claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of exhausted, starving villagers.<sup id="cite_ref-Dikotter33_31-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Dikotter33-31">[31]</a></sup> The inhabitants of Qingshui and Gansu referred to these projects as the "killing fields".<sup id="cite_ref-Dikotter33_31-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Dikotter33-31">[31]</a></sup>

### Crop production experiments [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Crop production experiments")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:People%27s_daily_13_Aug_1958_.jpg)

A _[People's Daily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Daily "People's Daily") front page report on 13 August 1958, that the Macheng Jianguo commune in Hubei had set a record of 36,956_ [jin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catty "Catty") _of early rice per_ [mu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_units_of_measurement "Chinese units of measurement")_, roughly 277,000 kilograms per hectare (247,000 lb/acre)_

On the communes, a number of radical and controversial agricultural innovations were promoted at the behest of Mao. Many of these innovations were based on the [ideas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism "Lysenkoism") of now discredited Soviet agronomist [Trofim Lysenko](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko "Trofim Lysenko") and his followers. The policies included close cropping, whereby seeds were sown far more densely than normal on the incorrect assumption that seeds of the same class would not compete with each other.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> [Deep plowing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_plowing "Deep plowing") was encouraged on the mistaken belief that this would yield plants with extra large root systems.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2019)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Moderately productive land was left unplanted based on the belief that concentrating manure and effort on the most fertile land would lead to large productivity gains per-acre. Altogether, these untested innovations generally led to decreases in grain production rather than increases.<sup id="cite_ref-hinton1984_35-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-hinton1984-35">[35]</a></sup>

Meanwhile, local leaders were pressured into falsely reporting ever-higher grain production figures to their political superiors. Participants at political meetings remembered production figures being inflated up to 10 times their actual production amounts as the race to please superiors and win plaudits—like the chance to meet Mao himself—intensified. The state was later able to force many production groups to sell more grain than they could spare based on these false production figures.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

The ban on [private holdings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property "Private property") ruined peasant life at its most basic level, according to Mirsky. Villagers were unable to secure enough food to go on living because they were deprived by the commune system of their traditional means of being able to rent, sell, or use their land as collateral for loans.<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky_5-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky-5">[5]</a></sup> In one village, once the commune was operational the Party boss and his colleagues "swung into manic action, herding villagers into the fields to sleep and to work intolerable hours, and forcing them to walk, starving, to distant additional projects".<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky_5-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky-5">[5]</a></sup>

Edward Friedman, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin; Paul Pickowicz, a historian at the University of California, San Diego, and [Mark Selden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Selden "Mark Selden"), a sociologist at Binghamton University, wrote about the dynamic of interaction between the Party and villagers:

> Beyond attack, beyond question, was the systemic and structured dynamic of the socialist state that intimidated and [impoverished](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impoverished "Impoverished") millions of patriotic and loyal villagers.<sup id="cite_ref-revolutionresistance_37-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-revolutionresistance-37">[37]</a></sup>

The authors present a similar picture to Thaxton in depicting the party's destruction of the traditions of Chinese villagers. Traditionally prized local customs were deemed signs of "[feudalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism "Feudalism")" to be extinguished, according to Mirsky. "Among them were funerals, weddings, local markets, and festivals. The Party thus destroyed much that gave meaning to Chinese lives. These private bonds were social glue. To mourn and to celebrate is to be human. To share joy, grief, and pain is humanizing."<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky2_38-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky2-38">[38]</a></sup> Failure to participate in the CCP's political campaigns—though the aims of such campaigns were often conflicting—"could result in detention, torture, death, and the suffering of entire families".<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky2_38-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky2-38">[38]</a></sup>

Public [struggle sessions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session "Struggle session") were often used to intimidate the peasants into obeying local officials; they increased the death rate of the famine in several ways, according to Thaxton. "In the first case, blows to the body caused internal injuries that, in combination with physical [emaciation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emaciation "Emaciation") and acute hunger, could induce death." In one case, after a peasant stole two cabbages from the common fields, the thief was publicly criticized for half a day. He collapsed, fell ill, and never recovered. Others were sent to [labor camps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_camp "Labor camp").<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>

Around 6 to 8% of those who died during the Great Leap Forward were tortured to death or summarily killed.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

Benjamin Valentino notes that "communist officials sometimes tortured and killed those accused of failing to meet their grain quota".<sup id="cite_ref-Valentino128_41-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Valentino128-41">[41]</a></sup>

However, J. G. Mahoney, Professor of Liberal Studies and East Asian Studies at [Grand Valley State University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Valley_State_University "Grand Valley State University"), has said that "there is too much diversity and dynamism in the country for one work to capture ... rural China as if it were one place." Mahoney describes an elderly man in rural [Shanxi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanxi "Shanxi") who recalls Mao fondly, saying "Before Mao we sometimes ate leaves, after liberation we did not." Regardless, Mahoney points out that Da Fo villagers recall the Great Leap Forward as a period of famine and death, and among those who survived in Da Fo were precisely those who could digest leaves.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

### Lushan Conference [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Lushan Conference")

The initial impact of the Great Leap Forward was discussed at the [Lushan Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lushan_Conference "Lushan Conference") in July–August 1959. Although many of the more moderate leaders had reservations about the new policy, the only senior leader to speak out openly was Marshal [Peng Dehuai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_Dehuai "Peng Dehuai"). Mao responded to Peng's criticism of the Great Leap by dismissing Peng from his post as Defence Minister, denouncing Peng (who came from a poor peasant family) and his supporters as "bourgeois", and launching a nationwide campaign against "rightist opportunism". Peng was replaced by [Lin Biao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Biao "Lin Biao"), who began a systematic purge of Peng's supporters from the military.

## Direct consequences [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Direct consequences")

The failure of agricultural policies, the movement of farmers from agricultural to industrial work, and weather conditions suppressed the food supply. At the same time improvements in medicine,<sup id="cite_ref-pmid25495509_43-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-pmid25495509-43">[43]</a></sup> infant mortality,<sup id="cite_ref-Dicker_44-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Dicker-44">[44]</a></sup> and average life expectancy<sup id="cite_ref-Dicker_44-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Dicker-44">[44]</a></sup> promoted by the [Patriotic Health Campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotic_Health_Campaign "Patriotic Health Campaign") led to a greatly increased need for food. The shortage of supply clashed with an explosion in demand, leading to millions of deaths from severe famine. The economy, which had improved since the end of the civil war, was devastated, and in response to the severe conditions, there was resistance among the populace.

The effects on the upper levels of government in response to the disaster were complex, with Mao purging the Minister of National Defense [Peng Dehuai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_Dehuai "Peng Dehuai") in 1959, the temporary promotion of [Lin Biao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Biao "Lin Biao"), [Liu Shaoqi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi "Liu Shaoqi"), and [Deng Xiaoping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping "Deng Xiaoping"), and Mao losing some power and prestige following the Great Leap Forward, during the [Seven Thousand Cadres Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Thousand_Cadres_Conference "Seven Thousand Cadres Conference") in 1962, which led him to launch the [Cultural Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution "Cultural Revolution") in 1966.<sup id="cite_ref-:04_45-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:04-45">[45]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:62_46-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:62-46">[46]</a></sup>

### Famine [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Famine")

Despite the harmful agricultural innovations, the weather was very favorable in 1958 and the harvest was also good. However, the amount of labor which was diverted to steel production and construction projects meant that much of the harvest was left to rot because it was not collected in some areas. This problem was exacerbated by a devastating [locust](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust "Locust") swarm, which was caused when their natural predators were killed as part of the [Four Pests Campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Pests_Campaign "Four Pests Campaign").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This paragraph needs references to reliable sources. (May 2023)">This paragraph needs citation(s)</span></a></i>]</sup>

Although actual harvests were reduced, local officials, under tremendous pressure to report record harvests to central authorities in response to the innovations, competed with each other to announce increasingly exaggerated results. These results were used as the basis for determining the amount of grain which would be taken by the State, supplied to the towns and cities and exported. This barely left enough grain for the peasants, and in some areas, starvation set in. A 1959 drought and flooding from the [Yellow River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_River "Yellow River") in the same year also contributed to the famine.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This paragraph needs references to reliable sources. (May 2023)">This paragraph needs citation(s)</span></a></i>]</sup>

The [Eurasian tree sparrow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_tree_sparrow "Eurasian tree sparrow") was the most notable target of the [Four Pests campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Pests_campaign "Four Pests campaign").

During 1958–1960 China continued to be a substantial net exporter of grain, despite the widespread famine which was being experienced in the countryside, as Mao sought to maintain face and convince the outside world of the success of his plans. Foreign aid was refused. When the Japanese foreign minister told his Chinese counterpart Chen Yi about an offer of 100,000 tonnes of wheat which was going to be shipped away from public view, he was rebuffed.

With dramatically reduced yields, even urban areas received greatly reduced rations; however, mass starvation was largely confined to the countryside, where, as a result of drastically inflated production statistics, very little grain was left for the peasants to eat. Food shortages were bad throughout the country, but the provinces which had adopted Mao's reforms with the most vigor, such as [Anhui](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui "Anhui"), [Gansu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu "Gansu") and [Henan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henan "Henan"), tended to suffer disproportionately. [Sichuan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan "Sichuan"), one of China's most populous provinces, known in China as "Heaven's Granary" because of its fertility, is thought to have suffered the highest number of deaths from starvation due to the vigor with which provincial leader [Li Jingquan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Jingquan "Li Jingquan") undertook Mao's reforms. There are widespread oral reports, though little official documentation, of cannibalism being practiced in various forms as a result of the famine.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-yang2013_50-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-yang2013-50">[50]</a></sup> Author [Yan Lianke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_Lianke "Yan Lianke") also claims that, while growing up in Henan during the Great Leap Forward, he was taught to "recognize the most edible kinds of bark and clay by his mother. When all of the trees had been stripped and there was no more clay, he learned that lumps of coal could appease the devil in his stomach, at least for a little while."<sup id="cite_ref-forbidden_51-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-forbidden-51">[51]</a></sup>

The agricultural policies of the Great Leap Forward and the associated famine continued until January 1961, when, at the Ninth Plenum of the [8th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/8th_Central_Committee_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party "8th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party"), the restoration of agricultural production through a reversal of the Great Leap policies was started. Grain exports were stopped, and imports from Canada and Australia reduced the impact of the food shortages, at least in the coastal cities.

#### Deaths by famine [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Deaths by famine")

The exact number of deaths by famine is difficult to determine, and estimates range from 15 million to 55 million people.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_4-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:3-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-dikotterxii_52-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-dikotterxii-52">[52]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-libé_53-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-lib%C3%A9-53">[53]</a></sup> Because of the uncertainties which are involved in estimating the number of deaths which were caused by the failure of the Great Leap Forward and the ensuing famine and because of the uncertainties which are involved in [estimating the numbers of deaths which were caused by other famines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines "List of famines"), it is difficult to compare the severity of different famines. If an estimate of 30 million deaths is accepted, the failure of the Great Leap Forward caused the deadliest famine in the history of China, and it also caused the deadliest famine in human history.<sup id="cite_ref-ashton614_54-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-ashton614-54">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> This extremely high loss of human lives was partially caused by [China's large population](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_China "Demographics of China"). To put things into absolute and relative numerical perspective: in the [Great Irish Famine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland) "Great Famine (Ireland)"), approximately 1 million people<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> out of a total population of 8 million people died, or 12.5% of Ireland's entire population.

The number of famine deaths during the Great Leap Forward has been estimated with different methods. Banister, Coale, and Ashton et al. compare age cohorts from the 1953, 1964, and 1982 censuses, yearly birth and death records, and results of the 1982 1:1000 fertility survey. From these they calculate excess deaths above a death rate interpolated between pre- and post-Leap death rates. All involve corrections for perceived errors inherent in the different data sets.<sup id="cite_ref-82"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> Peng uses reported deaths from the vital statistics of 14 provinces, adjusts 10% for under reporting, and expands the result to cover all of China assuming similar mortality rates in the other provinces. He uses 1956/57 death rates as the baseline death rate rather than an interpolation between pre- and post-GLF death rates.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup>

Houser, Sands, and Xiao in their 2005 research study using "provincial-level demographic panel data and a Bayesian empirical approach in an effort to distinguish the relative importance of weather and national policy on China's great demographic disaster" conclude that "in aggregate, from 1959 to 1961 China suffered about 14.8 million excess deaths. Of those, about 69% (or 10.3 million) seem attributable to effects stemming from national policies."<sup id="cite_ref-:4_67-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:4-67">[67]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 156">: 156 </span></sup> 

Cao uses information from "local annals" to determine for each locality the expected population increase from normal births and deaths, the population increase due to migration, and the loss of population between 1958 and 1961. He then adds the three figures to determine the number of excess deaths during the period 1959–1961.<sup id="cite_ref-yang272_86-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-yang272-86">[86]</a></sup> Chang and Halliday use death rates determined by "Chinese demographers" for the years 1957–1963, subtract the average of the pre-and post-Leap death rates (1957, 1962, and 1963) from the death rates of each of the years 1958–1961, and multiply each yearly excess death rate by the year's population to determine excess deaths.<sup id="cite_ref-chang438_87-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-chang438-87">[87]</a></sup>

#### Causes of the famine and responsibility for it [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Causes of the famine and responsibility for it")

The policies of the Great Leap Forward, the failure of the government to respond quickly and effectively to famine conditions, as well as Mao's insistence on maintaining high grain export quotas in the face of clear evidence of poor crop output were responsible for the famine. There is disagreement over how much, if at all, weather conditions contributed to the famine.

Significant amounts of agricultural labor had been transferred for steel production, resulting in a shortage of agricultural workers.<sup id="cite_ref-:22_106-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:22-106">[106]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 147">: 147 </span></sup>  Approximately 10% of crops could not be harvested as a result.<sup id="cite_ref-:22_106-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:22-106">[106]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 147">: 147 </span></sup>

Economist [Steven Rosefielde](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Rosefielde "Steven Rosefielde") argues that Yang's account "shows that Mao's slaughter was caused in considerable part by terror-starvation; that is, voluntary manslaughter (and perhaps murder) rather than innocuous famine."<sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup> Yang claims that local party officials were indifferent to the large number of people dying around them, as their primary concern was the delivery of grain, which Mao wanted to use to pay back debts to the USSR totaling 1.973 billion [yuan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_yuan "Chinese yuan"). In [Xinyang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinyang "Xinyang"), people died of starvation at the doors of grain warehouses.<sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup> Mao refused to open the state granaries as he dismissed reports of food shortages and accused the "[rightists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rightists "Rightists")" and the _[kulaks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulak "Kulak")_ of conspiring to hide grain.<sup id="cite_ref-114"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-114">[114]</a></sup>

From his research into records and talks with experts at the meteorological bureau, Yang concludes that the weather during the Great Leap Forward was not unusual compared to other periods and was not a factor.<sup id="cite_ref-yangint_115-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-yangint-115">[115]</a></sup> Yang also believes that the [Sino-Soviet split](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split "Sino-Soviet split") was not a factor because it did not happen until 1960, when the famine was well under way.<sup id="cite_ref-yangint_115-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-yangint-115">[115]</a></sup>

Mao's efforts to cool the Leap in late 1958 met resistance within the Party and when Mao proposed a scaling down of steel targets, "many people just wouldn't change and wouldn't accept it".<sup id="cite_ref-:5_116-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:5-116">[116]</a></sup> Thus, according to historian Tao Kai, the Leap "wasn't the problem of a single person, but that many people had ideological problems".

Mobo Gao suggested that the Great Leap Forward's terrible effects came not from malignant intent on the part of the Chinese leadership at the time, but instead related to the structural nature of its rule, and the vastness of China as a country.

### Deaths by violence [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Deaths by violence")

Not all deaths during the Great Leap were from starvation. [Frank Dikötter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Dik%C3%B6tter "Frank Dikötter"), in his book _[Mao's Great Famine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao%27s_Great_Famine "Mao's Great Famine")_, estimates that at least 2.5 million people were beaten or tortured to death and one million to three million committed suicide.<sup id="cite_ref-124"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-scmp723956_76-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-scmp723956-76">[76]</a></sup> He provided some illustrative examples and claimed that in [Xinyang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinyang "Xinyang"), where over a million died in 1960; 6–7% (around 67,000) of these were beaten to death by the militias. In [Daoxian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daoxian "Daoxian") county, 10% of those who died had been "buried alive, clubbed to death or otherwise killed by party members and their militia".

## Other impacts [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Other impacts")

### Failure of food supply [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Failure of food supply")

In agrarian policy, the failures of food supply during the Great Leap were met by a gradual de-[collectivization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivization "Collectivization") over the course of the 1960s that foreshadowed the further measures taken under Deng Xiaoping. Political scientist [Meredith Jung-En Woo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Jung-En_Woo "Meredith Jung-En Woo") argues: "Unquestionably the regime failed to respond in time to save the lives of millions of peasants, but when it did respond, it ultimately transformed the livelihoods of several hundred million peasants (modestly in the early 1960s, but permanently after Deng Xiaoping's reforms subsequent to 1978)."<sup id="cite_ref-128"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>

Despite the risks to their careers, some Communist Party members openly laid blame for the disaster at the feet of the Party leadership and took it as proof that China must rely more on education, acquiring technical expertise and applying [bourgeois](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie "Bourgeoisie") methods in developing the [economy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_science "Economic science"). [Liu Shaoqi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi "Liu Shaoqi") made a speech in 1962 at "[Seven Thousand Cadres Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Thousand_Cadres_Conference "Seven Thousand Cadres Conference")" criticizing that "\[the\] economic disaster was 30% fault of nature, 70% [human error](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_error "Human error")."<sup id="cite_ref-129"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup>

A 2017 paper by economists found "strong evidence that the unrealistic yield targets led to excessive death tolls from 1959 to 1961, and further analysis shows that yield targets induced the inflation of grain output figures and excessive procurement. We also find that Mao's radical policy caused serious deterioration in human [capital accumulation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_accumulation "Capital accumulation") and slower economic development in the policy-affected regions decades after the death of Mao."<sup id="cite_ref-130"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Quotations#Specific_recommendations" title="Wikipedia:Quotations"><span title="too-lengthy quotation (December 2023)">excessive&nbsp;quote</span></a></i>]</sup>

A dramatic decline in grain output continued for several years, involving in 1960–61 a drop in output of more than 25 percent. Causes of this drop are found in both natural disaster and government policy.<sup id="cite_ref-ashton614_54-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-ashton614-54">[54]</a></sup>

### Industrialization [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Industrialization")

Overall, the Great Leap Forward failed to rapidly industrialize China as intended.<sup id="cite_ref-:122_17-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:122-17">[17]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 84">: 84 </span></sup>

There were various forms of resistance to the consequences of the Great Leap Forward. Several provinces saw armed rebellion,<sup id="cite_ref-Dikötter226_142-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Dik%C3%B6tter226-142">[142]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Rummel247_143-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Rummel247-143">[143]</a></sup> though these rebellions never posed a serious threat to the Central Government.<sup id="cite_ref-Dikötter226_142-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Dik%C3%B6tter226-142">[142]</a></sup> Rebellions are documented to have occurred in [Henan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henan "Henan"), [Shandong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shandong "Shandong"), [Qinghai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinghai "Qinghai"), [Gansu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu "Gansu"), [Sichuan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan "Sichuan"), [Fujian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian "Fujian"), and [Yunnan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan "Yunnan") provinces and in the [Tibetan Autonomous Region](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Autonomous_Region "Tibetan Autonomous Region").<sup id="cite_ref-Dikötter226b_144-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Dik%C3%B6tter226b-144">[144]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Rummel247b_145-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Rummel247b-145">[145]</a></sup> In Henan, Shandong, Qinghai, Gansu, and Sichuan, these rebellions lasted more than a year,<sup id="cite_ref-Rummel247b_145-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Rummel247b-145">[145]</a></sup> with the [Spirit Soldier rebellion of 1959](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_Soldier_rebellion_(1959) "Spirit Soldier rebellion (1959)") being one of the few larger-scale uprisings.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESmith2015346_146-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmith2015346-146">[146]</a></sup> There was also occasional violence against cadre members.<sup id="cite_ref-Rummel247_143-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Rummel247-143">[143]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Dikötter224_147-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Dik%C3%B6tter224-147">[147]</a></sup> Raids on granaries,<sup id="cite_ref-Rummel247_143-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Rummel247-143">[143]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Dikötter224_147-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Dik%C3%B6tter224-147">[147]</a></sup> arson and other vandalism, train robberies, and raids on neighboring villages and counties were common.<sup id="cite_ref-Dikötter224_147-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-Dik%C3%B6tter224-147">[147]</a></sup>

According to Ralph Thaxton, professor of politics at [Brandeis University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandeis_University "Brandeis University"), villagers turned against the CCP during and after the Great Leap, seeing it as autocratic, brutal, corrupt, and mean-spirited.<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky_5-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky-5">[5]</a></sup> According to Thaxton, the CCP's policies included plunder, forced labor, and starvation, which led villagers "to think about their relationship with the Communist Party in ways that do not bode well for the continuity of socialist rule."<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky_5-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky-5">[5]</a></sup>

Often, villagers composed [doggerel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggerel "Doggerel") to show their defiance to the regime, and "perhaps, to remain sane". During the Great Leap, one jingle ran: "Flatter shamelessly—eat delicacies.... Don't flatter—starve to death for sure."<sup id="cite_ref-mirsky2_38-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-mirsky2-38">[38]</a></sup>

### Impact on the government [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Impact on the government")

Officials were prosecuted for exaggerating production figures, although punishments varied. In one case, a provincial party secretary was dismissed and prohibited from holding higher office. A number of county-level officials were publicly tried and executed.<sup id="cite_ref-148"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup>

Mao stepped down as State Chairman of the PRC on April 27, 1959, but remained CCP Chairman. Liu Shaoqi (the new PRC Chairman) and reformist [Deng Xiaoping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping "Deng Xiaoping") (CCP General Secretary) were left in charge to change policy to bring economic recovery. Mao's Great Leap Forward policy was openly criticized at the [Lushan party conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lushan_Conference "Lushan Conference") by one person. Criticism from Minister of National Defense [Peng Dehuai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peng_Dehuai "Peng Dehuai"), who, discovered that people from his home province starved to death caused him to write a letter to Mao to ask for the policies to be adapted.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_127-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:6-127">[127]</a></sup> After the Lushan showdown, Mao replaced Peng with [Lin Biao](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Biao "Lin Biao") and Peng was sent off into obscurity.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_127-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:6-127">[127]</a></sup>

However, by 1962, it was clear that the party had changed away from the extremist ideology that led to the Great Leap. During 1962, the party held a number of conferences and rehabilitated most of the deposed comrades who had criticized Mao in the aftermath of the Great Leap. The event was again discussed, with much [self-criticism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-criticism "Self-criticism"), and the contemporary government called it a "serious \[loss\] to our country and people" and blamed the [cult of personality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality "Cult of personality") of Mao.

At the Lushan conference of 1959, Peng Dehuai, one of the great marshals of the Chinese civil war against the nationalists, was a strong supporter of the Leap. But the discovery that people from his own home area were starving to death prompted him to write to Mao to ask for the policies to be adapted. Mao was furious, reading the letter out in public and demanding that his colleagues in the leadership line up either behind him or Peng. Almost to a man, they supported Mao, with his security chief Kang Sheng declaring of the letter: "I make bold to suggest that this cannot be handled with lenience."

In particular, at the _[Seven Thousand Cadres Conference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Thousand_Cadres_Conference "Seven Thousand Cadres Conference")_ in January – February 1962, Mao made a [self-criticism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-criticism "Self-criticism") and re-affirmed his commitment to [democratic centralism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_centralism "Democratic centralism"). In the years that followed, Mao mostly abstained from the operations of government, making policy largely the domain of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. Maoist ideology took a back seat in the Communist Party, until Mao launched the [Cultural Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution "Cultural Revolution") in 1966 which marked his political comeback.

Following the failures of the Great Leap Forward, Chinese leadership slowed the pace of industrialization, focusing more on the development of China's already more developed coastal areas and the production of consumer goods.<sup id="cite_ref-:03_134-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:03-134">[134]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 3">: 3 </span></sup>  Thus, during the preliminary formulation of the Third Five Year Plan (which had been delayed due to the economic turmoil),<sup id="cite_ref-149"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup> Liu stated:<sup id="cite_ref-:03_134-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:03-134">[134]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 51">: 51 </span></sup> 

> In the past, the infrastructure battlefront was too long. There were too many projects. Demands were too high and rushed. Designs were done badly, and projects were hurriedly begun ... We only paid attention to increasing output and ignored quality. We set targets too highly. We must always remember these painful learning experiences.

During the discussion of the Third Five Year Plan, Mao made similar statements about the Great Leap Forward having "extended the infrastructure battlefront too long", acknowledging that it was "best to do less and well".<sup id="cite_ref-:03_134-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:03-134">[134]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 56">: 56 </span></sup> 

The failures of the Great Leap Forward also informed the government's approach to the [Third Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Front_(China) "Third Front (China)") construction campaign which followed a few years later and which built basic industry and national defense industry in China's interior.<sup id="cite_ref-:03_134-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:03-134">[134]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 9">: 9 </span></sup>  Rather than adopting the Great Leap Forward's approach of locally developed projects, the mass mobilizations of the Third Front were centrally planned.<sup id="cite_ref-:03_134-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:03-134">[134]</a></sup><sup><span title="Pages: 10–12">: 10–12 </span></sup> 

### Ecological impact [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Ecological impact")

The Great Leap Forward resulted in ecological impacts through [deforestation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation "Deforestation") that resulted, as well as the expansion of agriculture into areas ill-suited for it.<sup id="cite_ref-:122_17-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:122-17">[17]</a></sup><sup><span title="Pages: 83–84">: 83–84 </span></sup> 

### Health impacts [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Health impacts")

There is evidence that survivors of the famine suffered sustained negative effects to their long-term health and economic outcomes. Those in early childhood during the famine were impacted the most, and it has been estimated that the 1959 birth cohort would have otherwise grown 3cm taller in adulthood. <sup id="cite_ref-150"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup>

Cohorts born during the famine showed higher infant and early life mortality, but exhibit a "mortality crossover" pattern, with mortality rates leveling off or even dropping relative to non-famine cohorts beyond a certain point. This could be explained by the combined effects of initial debilitation, in which malnutrition and hardship increase early deaths, and selection for robustness among famine survivors resulting in fewer later deaths.<sup id="cite_ref-151"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup>

### Cultural impact [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Leap_Forward&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Cultural impact")

Consistent with the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and industry, authorities promoted the New Folksong Movement and the Peasant Painting Movement, from which hundreds of thousands of new artists emerged.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 167">: 167 </span></sup>  Through the New Folksong Movement, millions of new folk songs and poems were written and collected.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 167">: 167 </span></sup>  As part of the Peasant Painting Movement, peasant artists decorated village walls with Great Leap Forward-themed murals.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 167">: 167 </span></sup> 

On March 9, 1958, the [Ministry of Culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Culture_(China) "Ministry of Culture (China)") held a meeting to introduce a Great Leap Forward in [cinema](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_China "Cinema of China").<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Pages: 149–150">: 149–150 </span></sup>  During the Great Leap Forward, the film industry rapidly expanded, with documentary films being the genre that experienced the greatest growth.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 150">: 150 </span></sup>  The total number of film-screening venues, including both urban cinemas and mobile projection units which traveled through rural China, radically increased.<sup id="cite_ref-:Qian2_11-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-:Qian2-11">[11]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 150">: 150 </span></sup>

Data on food availability suggest that, in contrast to many other famines, a root cause of this one was a dramatic decline in grain output that continued for several years, involving in 1960–61 a drop in output of more than 25 percent. Causes of this drop are found in both natural disaster and government policy."

At least 45 million people died unnecessary deaths during China's Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1962, including 2.5 million tortured or summarily killed, according to a new book by a Hong Kong scholar. Mao's Great Famine traces the story of how Mao Zedong's drive for absurd targets for farm and industrial production and the reluctance of anyone to challenge him created the conditions for the countryside to be emptied of grain and millions of farmers left to starve.

Peng used the pre-Leap death rate as a base line under the assumption that the decrease after the Great Leap to below pre-Leap levels was caused by Darwinian selection during the massive deaths of the famine. He writes that if this drop was instead a continuation of the decreasing mortality in the years prior to the Great Leap, his estimate would be an underestimate.
