	I am shy so I find it hard to say in person when I have received good or great customer service so I like to email the company directly and let them know. I always try to remember the persons name and to be specific, so that it might make it back to the employee or they might win a employee of the month award.

		It really does make a difference. I had a flight attendant that did a great job and I tweeted about it. When he had me on a flight like 6 months later he remembered me and proudly told me they read my tweet in a training class. You’re doing a fantastic thing by doing that.

	I used to leave my parking permit on the permit machines if I had an early day at community college so someone else didn’t have to pay. Turns out it started a trend and people still do it. 

	I can’t take the full credit though, I think someone accidentally bought two and didn’t realize it so they left it at the machine.

		I used to do the same with bus tickets. 
		
		The bus tickets in my area used to do paper tickets that were valid all day. So when I got off the stop near my flat I'd leave the ticket in the bus stop for the next person. 
		
		The tickets are all on an app now, or online monthly payments.

	Donate blood products. Your body's constantly making red blood cells and platelets, and it's harmless (and possibly healthy) to donate. I started with whole blood because, well, that's what "donating blood" means to people. Fifteen minutes of time, eat a cookie, get a sticker.

	After I did that for a few gallons I was asked if I'd consider donating platelets. They have to be used within five days of collection so there's always a constant need, but it takes about two hours to do it. A single pint of blood doesn't have enough for a platelet transfusion, so the donor ends up hooked to an apheresis machine that'll centrifuge the blood, remove the platelets, and return the rest of the blood back to the body. So I end up watching Netflix for 2 hours on Saturday while doing another triple donation, every other week, up to 24 times a year.

	It's like Spider-Man's quote in Civil War: "When you can do the things I can, but you don't, and then the bad things happen ... they happen because of you." Obviously donating like this isn't saving the world, but it's making the world a better place, and I'd feel ashamed if I just spend that time watching Netflix at home instead of doing some good at the same time.

	(I also donated bone marrow in 2008, so that was a little more of a "if you can help and don't, and bad things happen, it's your fault" situation, as I was the best available match in the entire world for my recipient. That was a little thing to me, but a life-changing thing for that person's family.)

		I’ve been a blood donor for over 25 years. I’m O- so they have always just taken whole blood from me - but I’ve always wondered what the platelet donation would be like. Anyway, I feel like it’s such an easy thing to do and it does so much for others.

			It's 2+ hours and it's boring. But that's because I'm a big guy and i have a high platelet count, so they usually get 2 bags out of me. I've donated over 2 gallons. Those free movie tickets are worth it.

			Yes O- here too, I get a text usually within the week that my blood has already been used. I did platelets when I was a broke E3 in the military- it's about the same, just takes longer.

		My mom has been donating to a local blood bank in Toronto since she turned 21 and since then (35 years give or take) she’s donated 138 times! Not sure how much blood that is but I’ve always admired her for that. Most selfless woman I know.
		
		EDIT: Just talked with my mom and I have grossly misrepresented the amount of blood she’s donated! I updated the numbers and will post the total amount she’s donated below! 
		
		1 Pint per visit x 138 visits = 138 Pints (17 &amp; 1/4 Gallons or 65.3 Litres for comparison!)

	I always make sure to be overly polite to people serving me, wether in a restaurant or a shop and I always tell them to have a good day when I leave. Having worked in retail I know a simple how are you, thank you or a have a nice day can mean a lot, especially on a bad shift. I was raised to have good manners and I’ll be damned if I don’t flex them at any opportunity I have. It always surprises/saddens me that other people can’t be the same way.

	Take care of my things. We didn't have much while growing up and my mother always believed in quality. She would buy things she knew we would use a lot. I have the same pencil case from 6th grade, I'm in grad school now. I have linen bedsheets, water bottles, fountain pens, mugs, and even some clothes that I've used for over 10 years. This helps me consume less, inturn creating less waste. I feel like we should strive to reduce, before reusing and recycling.

		It blows my mind how some people go through so much crap because they see it as disposable or it's "out of fashion".
		
		I've had the same backpack since 2007, the same duffel bag since 2004, and the same laundry ~~hamper~~ basket since 2000. I also use the ~~hamper~~ laundry basket to put my groceries in when I go to the store so I'm not using bags, either.
		
		I'm also in grad school and I've got ten + year old binders and the same ruler I've had since middle school.
		
		My dad hammered it into me that you take care of your stuff. It was annoying when I was younger but once I started paying for all my own stuff I was so glad he was like that

		My husband always says "you're welcome" whenever anyone thanks him for anything.  You wouldn't  believe how often we skip it until you hear him.  He holds a door open and someone mutters thanks, he says you're welcome. He hands me a  dish I'm reaching for and I just 'thanks,' and he says you're welcome. Always does. No matter how small or inconsequential.
		
		Slight clarification: he never says No Problem or anything else.  (I don't know if I buy it, but I did hear once that no problem has an unspoken connotation that it (the action) could have been a problem). I personally do like My Pleasure,  and I use all of these.  My husband, though, only says You're Welcome. Try it for every little thing, you'll be noticed, and no, it doesn't come across as insincere or overly formal (he definitely is not that! lol).

		I know many don’t care and just want to be done with their shift, but that’s the point. And some really seem to come alive if they realize you’re treating them like someone who deserves notice.

	Move turtles out of the road :)

	Edit: [here’s a link to a NatGeo article](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/12/shell-game--how-to-tell-a-turtle-from-a-tortoise/) explaining the difference between turtles and tortoises, because apparently some people want to act confused. A wildlife biologist explains that “turtle” can be used as an umbrella term for all turtle-like reptiles :)

			Me: "Hi, Vicki.  I have a charge on my bill that I don't understand.  I'm hoping you can help me with that."

			And if you're feeling very friendly, you can close the call with: "Thanks for your help, Vicki.  Have a nice day."

		When I worked at Starbucks, I tried to say one compliment to each customer that went through the drive-thru. It could be something as simple as, “nice sunglasses” or watch or whatever. It could literally be anything and it totally switched people’s attitude toward you. 
		
		I told other partners, other employees, to do this and it somehow made some shifts a lot easier to manage, customer wise. 
		
		I still try to do this at work but it’s a little harder now with the social distancing and masks.
		
		EDIT: Oh my goodness, I didn’t expect for this to get so many responses. Thanks everyone! 
		
		It’s honestly one of the very few things I can do for strangers. I’m a social worker now and I’m not able to see my clients but when I was able to see them, I do the same thing. You hair looks nice today, that’s a good color on you, little things. Since I can’t see them now I’m pretty much stuck to “you sound really good today, how was your lunch?” (I mostly work with the elderly) or if I know they’ve been sick, you’re sounding better from when we last talked, and it really gets their spirits up. 
		
		I try to do this with cashiers too but reading body language is very important. Some people just don’t want to talk or hear people talk and that’s ok too! It’s also good to know that some people don’t know how to respond to compliments, so don’t be offended if you don’t get a response back. 
		
		But simple is key for me, I always greet our receptionists at work and tell them bye when I leave. I think something as simple as acknowledging people’s presence makes a big difference. 
		
		Thank you for the silvers!! 
		
		Much love to everyone! Stay safe out there.

	Loop back around to someone if they get cut off during conversation. In high school, I had one friend who would always dominate the conversation and would cut off people  while they were talking, or straight up tell them “no one cares” and talk about herself. 

	I know it sounds silly and cliche, but she viewed herself as more popular, so she would do this to exert her power over others. She used to do this to me all the time when I was “less popular”, but I eventually became one of the more popular ones in the group, so she came to respect me a lot more. Anytime she cut someone off in conversation, I would loop back around to them and ask “sorry, what were you saying about...?” To give them a chance to speak. 

	I know it’s such a small thing, and teenage girl “politics” and power flexes are so stupid, but one thing I always carried with me was how poorly that girl treated me when she didn’t view me as popular, so I made sure to include everyone in our friend group once she came to respect me more. 

	I still do this today, if a softer spoken person gets cut off during conversation because I think it makes them feel like people actually care what they have to say. So fuck that girl from high school, but also thank you in a way. I was talking to another girl from that friend group recently, and she told me that she recently had to cut off ties and go to therapy for the way that girl treated her.

You’d be surprised (or maybe not) how many assholes there are in healthcare that make mountains out of mole hills, flip out on people for minor errors (not stuff that would bring patient harm), and worst of all give themselves far more leeway than they do the people they flip out on.

	I try to help when I see people in need. A few weeks ago I pushed a ladies car up to a gas pump. Yesterday I gave a a couple some water bottles. They went for an evening walk out by their house and were coming to top of a very long semi steep hill. We were way out.in the forest so I drive by slow and asked if they were alright. They just chuckled and said yes and the husband asked if we had any water so I pulled over to the side and gave them each a bottle from my cooler.

	 My favorite random act of kindness was seeing a guy with his hood up on I25. Stopped and asked him if I could help cuz I had my tools with me. He said he owned a shop not far from my house and just needed a ride to get his other vehicle and his wife and kids were in the car, even showed me his cards. I gave him a ride and he noticed my power steering pump was going out and told me to call him next week and he would look at it. When I met up with him he got me a power steering pump and installed it. It was an old Chevy so cheap and easy for him. He said he had been sitting there 45 minutes and I was the first person to stop for him and that's why he did it.

	Take my shopping cart to the return corral when I'm done with it.

	Edited to soapbox: the awards were unnecessary but appreciated. As other Redditors have pointed out, returning a shopping cart is trivial, not an accomplishment. I think overlooking good behavior as an expectation devalues the act of doing good, though. Especially with regard to children, praising good behavior is beneficial, even when you think it's the default. It promotes good people within society, and we need that.

		I like this and have done it, but I don't know how I feel about the idea as a whole. I like when it stops at that person, but I don't want them to feel the burden of having to continue it. I've seen posts of people talking negatively about the person "breaking the chain" and I don't feel like the point should be to create a chain reaction where everyone feels like they have to keep it going or be a jerk.

			Right - if it's a chain then it sort of defeats the purpose of brightening someone's day. Instead of you getting a free drink, you get a social obligation that might end up being more expensive than what your drink would have been in the first place.

		In all seriousness it does exist.  I have a no-pirating-ever rule with indie music and startups, movies I have to have at least paid to see the theater release (or buy it immediately after), and *almost* never games.

	Amplify people that get talked over in conversation. It’s so soul-crushing to get interrupted and feel like no one even noticed you were talking, so I try really, really hard to notice and say something like, “hey, you were saying something you didn’t get to finish, what was it?” It makes a big difference for me, and I hope it helps others too. 

	Another one that’s way different: I try to stock the bathrooms at my house so guests won’t have to ask for something that would make them embarrassed; pads, tampons, extra toilet paper, gas tablets, tums, etc. And every bathroom has a plunger, because no one should have to say “um, I clogged your toilet.” Unless they just want to share that story!
