	I think you are underselling just how badly the British and French fucked everything up and essentially kneecapped any hope of a clean resolution during and just after WWI. During the conflict, they promised the Arabs that if they fought against the Ottomans, they would have independence in the future. Then at the same time, they issued the Balfor Declaration, which they declared support for a Jewish state. They broke their promise to the Arabs when they formed the Mandate of Palestine, and this was followed by the Churchill White Paper, which maintained the Balfor Declaration but also discouraged Jewish immigration to the region, which was kind of seen as a slap in the face to Jewish communities. It isn't that they just arbitrarily started drawing lines; it's that they made promises of statehood to both parties and then broke those promises to both. Even if the British came up with the best borders possible that fixed everything, it still wouldn't be enough since they promised everything to both sides.

		>I think you are underselling just how badly the British and French fucked everything up
		
		Most modern issues tend to tie back to European colonialism. I know its not the most popular thing to say in some circles but europe was/is not a force of civilizing the world as some knuckle draggers like to claim. Even when Europe did positive things there was often underhanded motives to it. Not saying non European states were any better and not capable of doing such things but Europe was really good at it.
		
		The last 300 something years have shown that even when Europe loses they still win. Palatine/Israel is just one of many Fuck ups of European design. You mentioned the rash map drawings Britain and France did its very similar to any place they had holdings over.
		
		Take Africa for example and how its drawn up Europe is the cause for that and many problems came about because of it. Same with the middle east.
		
		Sometimes its done by design other times its simple arrogance and not giving a damn about the implications of how they draw up the maps and form the nation states that will govern it.

			While I agree with the idea of colonialism being an issue, a big part of the reason why the land got divided into a multitude of nations (and the way Israel/Palestine is divided; besides the multiple wars/trades conducted after creation of Israel) was in part due to the Ottoman Empire and the Arab Sunni-Fundamentalists who fought on behalf of the Ottomans contributing to multiple genocides that numbered in the tens of millions dead+displaced.
			
			The Hashemites (Jordanians) were one of the few Arabs who rebelled against the Ottomans and were therefore given more favorable border terms. When an empire such as the Ottomans(Nazis, Soviets, Japanese, etc.) lose a war, their borders are frequently rearranged.

		My understanding is the Jewish immigration to Palestine was already well under way during the late 19th century under Ottoman control and most of the Jewish states initial territory was basically just a boundary around the areas where Jews had been buying land perfectly legally for decades by the time Israel was formed. Essentially Jewish people asking for a state after WW1 under the same premise as, say, Poland, based on ethnic composition under the same nationalistic ideology that drove many post WW1 borders

			There was some, to be sure. [This table on Wikipedia, in the "Historic Data" section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah#Historic_data) breaks it down in numbers. Make sure you look at the period of time each column represents, because each one is different!
			
			Total Jewish immigration to Palestine from...
			
			...1882–1918 (period of 36 years): 62,000
			
			...1919–1948 (period of 29 years): 482,857
			
			...1948-1951 (period of **3** years!): 687,624
			
			So yes, there was definitely a good amount in the late nineteenth century — tens of thousands of people moving there is by no means an insignificant amount. But it just really isn't comparable to what came after the Balfour Declaration or the formation of the Israeli Nation-State at all. The immigration following those events is not a continuation of what came before; they definitely began trends of immigration that did not exist prior.

				Through no fault of your own, you're misrepresenting the meaning of the numbers here significantly. Look at the source [Wikipedia](https://web.archive.org/web/20131006090823/http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st04_02&amp;CYear=2012) links to: 
				
				You have little to no change in the 5 years after the Balfour Declaration. Then a spike- with a real significant jump during WW2 and the Holocaust, for obvious reasons. And then after Israel becomes a state and they're in control of immigration and Jews are looking to leave Europe you see much larger numbers. But 5 years isn't an insignificant amount of time, and it takes that long for immigration to pick up- plus they have no data for the years immediately before the Balfour Declaration, so even the slight bump that might exist after the Balfour Declaration is uncertain. I'm not saying the Balfour Declaration had no impact on immigration, I'm sure it did. But the trend you thought was so clear is just because Wikipedia lumped long periods of time into one number.

				* 🟪 **[016Bramble](https://www.reddit.com/user/016Bramble)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-03-01 12:01:22)_

					The more detailed source you linked actually demonstrates what I was saying even better. Your point about "a real significant jump during WW2 and the Holocaust" is flatly untrue, though, as I'll show below:
					
					1919-1923 (period of 4 years): 35,183 — over half of the amount that arrived in the 36-year period from 1882-1918 moved there in just 4 years following the end of WW1, during which the British government made the Balfour Declaration.
					
					Maybe you don't know when WW2 started, but there is no spike during WW2 or the holocaust as you claim. The sharp increase that began after the Balfour Declaration reached its peak in the 1930s, when the Nazi party began to gain power in Germany, which is indicative of a broader trend of antisemitism across Europe, but it decreased following the beginning of WW2 in 1939 and the Holocaust in 1941.
					
					>1932-1938 (period of 6 years, before WW2): 197,235 (avg: \~32888/year)  
					>  
					>1938-1945 (period of 6 years, during WW2): 81,808 (avg: \~13635/year)  
					>  
					>1946-1948 (period of 2 years, after WW2): 56,467 (avg: \~28234/year)
					
					So before and after WW2, we have a pretty comparable annual average, with a dip during the war and the Holocaust which makes sense. A raging war makes travel much more difficult and dangerous, let alone a war on the scale of WW2. And then on top of that, it would have been especially dangerous for a Jewish person to leave Europe at that time, as they would have had to hide from the Nazis who were conquering the continent and were obviously rounding them up in concentration camps.
					
					It's only after 1948, though, that we see have that massive spike you were talking about (and which I referred to in my initial comment), which obviously has much more to do with the beginning of the Israeli nation-state, the huge increase in unpopulated land due to the expulsion of the indigenous Palestinians during Nakba, and also the Arab-Israeli war also led to an spike in Jewish people in Arab countries moving to Palestine, whether by expulsion, fear of antisemitism that was stoked during the war, or simply by belief in the Zionist movement being increased by the establishment of an explicitly Jewish nation-state.

			>most of the Jewish states initial territory was basically just a boundary around the areas where Jews had been buying land perfectly legally for decades by the time Israel was formed
			
			Buying land from whom?
			
			It might sound like a silly question, but it's a huge part of the problem. Much of the arab population of Ottoman Palestine were poor tenant farmers who rented the land they lived on from (predominantly Turkish) landlords.
			
			After the collapse of the Ottoman empire, many of those landlords became absentee and stopped collecting rent, leaving the land in dispute.
			
			So when you say Jews bought the land legally, what you actually mean is that they found the original Turkish landlords, many of whom hadn't set foot on the land for years, bought it from them and then showed up and told the people already living there, who had not received any money from the sale and did not have the capital to move or buy new land on which to farm, to fuck off because it was their land now.
			
			You can perhaps see how that would create an impossible situation.

					I mean, it's not really different at all. Colonialism in general is inherently abusive, the idea that you can just redraw borders on a map to serve your own interests is generally not going to go well for the people who live there.
					
					The point here is firstly that the the collapse of the Ottoman empire left existing land ownership in a contested state. Just because someone legitimately believed that they bought the land legally doesn't mean that the people living there had any reason to recognize the legality of that purchase, especially if the owner has no de facto control over their on-paper property.
					
					The second point is just one of empathy. Imagine you are farmer. Your family has worked the same plot of land for generations. It's not a big plot of land and it won't ever make you rich, but it's provided for you and your family. How are you going to react if someone you've never met comes along and tells you they own it and you need to leave. They aren't offering you any compensation or replacement land, so the likely result of you leaving is that your family faces destitution.
					
					Even if that situation is "legal", even if every step to get there makes sense, what motivation do you have to passively accept the loss of your livelihood?

			Yeah one thing people have to remember abou(Zionism)t the Jewish immigration to Palestine it was heavily supported by antisemites in order to solve the "Jewish problem" (look at Belford's alien act of 1905. Another major Zionist agreement  was the haavara agreement of 1933 in Germany.  Even today at pro-IS  marches contain antisemites like John Hagee. Who said God had to Holocaust so Jews would go to the holy land. For those who don't know evangelical believe all Jews need to go to IS rebuilt the temple so that rapture is triggered this causing all those who are not believers(Jews, atheist, Muslims, etc)will die and evangelical Christians will meet Jesus and ascend to heaven. 
			On top of that the Zionist movement based on hertzel himself was a profoundly colonialist movement, one  example is the large scale  loss of the political power of native Arab Jews for those who came from Europe by the UK and later the rising haganah if they failed to try to push out their fellow natives.

		I think you are mischaracterizing what happened. The British promised both sides an independent state in Palestine— the Zionists were content with part of Palestine whereas the Arabs believed they could win a war and kill all the Jews.
		
		Obviously, that’s not what happened. But the shame from the lost wars to Israel never went away. Israel’s neighbors who were obviously not under any threat nor occupation still declared 3 more wars after the first on Israel.
		
		It is endemic in Arab culture to want to rectify that pan-national humiliation. The leaders of the Arab world basically promised their people the vindication of the pan-Arab movement upon the destruction of Israel. And then the 6 Days War happened which utterly humiliated the Arabs.
		
		Anyway, to your point about the British— both sides got fucked, but only one side made it their entire mission to eliminate the other. Arab fundamentalism is more of an issue than the military occupation of the West Bank.

			I notice two attributions that are questionable here.
			
			“Arabs believed they could win and kill all the Jews.”
			
			The Jews were for a Jewish state; the Arabs were against it. Because they already lived there, and would suddenly be citizens of a Jewish state, when they didn't want that.
			
			Their objective was to prevent a Jewish state or replace it with an Arab one, clearly. But from there to “exterminate the Jews” is a giant leap. They lived alongside Jews for centuries before this. “As second class citizens!” Yes, as second class citizens. But without attempting to exterminate the Jews.
			
			It’s a bit overheated to believe that they don’t have a mere policy objective, to replace one state with another — but that they’re basically bloodthirsty savages that want to exterminate an entire population. It’s also a common propaganda tactic. We humans always paint our enemies that way. And with the Holocaust as backdrop, for the Israelis it becomes an unquestioned part of the national identity.
			
			“It is endemic in Arab culture to want to rectify the pan-national humiliation.”
			
			Really? “Endemic to the culture”? Really? This sounds like more of the same war propaganda, and it sounds like fundamental attribution error on steroids.
			
			Would a randomly selected Arab say that the Israeli state is a bad thing? Sure. That’s a widely held belief that few Arabs question. Is Arab culture built around a burning desire to avenge Nassar? Give me a break. The average Arab outside Palestine barely gives any thought to Israel. Their attitude is comparable to Americans’ attitude toward North Korea: bad place, yep; filthy commies, yep; oppressors, yep.
			
			The governments are where you find actionable policies toward Israel, and wouldn’t be easy to find evidence that they’re snarling to enact another Holocaust either. Egypt has a peace treaty. Saudi Arabia let the US defend Israel based in Saudi air bases —  which is one of the things that pissed off one O. bin Ladin so much that he destroyed a certain landmark in New York City.
			
			The neighbors aren’t friendly, and in your grandparents’ day they tried to prevent or topple the Israeli state, yes. But they’ve accepted the fact that Israel isn’t going anywhere. They’re down to squabbling over this or that. The biggest bone of contention is the treatment of the Palestinians.

				There were many Arabs that lived in Israeli borders within the 1948 Resolution that *did not* revolt and accepted citizenship in Israel. To argue that they all explicitly wanted to live in an Arab State to the extent they would attack their neighbors is just false.
				
				There were plenty of Jews in the Arab World that did not immedoately flock to Israel either— they only went when they were forced to go.
				
				I never said savages, but considering the rhetoric of the newly formed Arab States specifically used Nazi propaganda to help boost support in the new nations for the new governments, it’s not a stretch to suggest a second Holocaust was on the horizon. One can only imagine what would have been done if the Jews of the Arab World did not have Israel to escape to in the 50s.
				
				Yes, it was endemic to the culture. Negative qualities can be part of a cultural identity. Americans still have islamophobic tendencies as part of 9/11, generally have a problem with colorblindness, etc. The issue in the Arab world lies with an existential contention with the Jews.
				
				And yes, it is a humiliation about the loss. Not of Nasser. The Arabs in the entire region were sold for decades that they would “recover the holy land from the infidels.” It became a part of their national identity. Syria, Transjordan, and Egypt all planned to invade and capture the territory. Instead, tiny Israel absolutely annihilated the armies in a huge underdog victory and now to boot, Israel occupied even more land. It was deeply traumatic.
				
				Arabs didn’t look at Israelis as oppressors because to them, the Jews are inferior. *Today*, they consider the *West* and specifically the US as oppressors for supporting Israel. But that the Israelis themselves are a puppet and would otherwise be destroyed, harmony would exist, etc.
				
				The Arab culture has not “accepted Israel as a State.” After the Israeli counter-offensive into Gaza, the governments of the Arab World that were not interested in fighting Israel in the conflict had to work overtime to prevent protests from turning into riots across their countries. The governments have “accepted” it, but the people far from believe that to be a fact. They still believe in the destruction of Israel.

					Please note that I have never once said “all Arabs.” That was on purpose: I do understand that every generalization is false.
					
					The use of Nazi-like propaganda isn’t too surprising. It’s evil, but not surprising. Dehumanizing the enemy is what humans do: we consolidate support for the war by turning in-group bias up to eleven.
					
					And I agree with you that if I were a Holocaust survivor, or a child of one, I would absolutely be afraid of another when I see that kind of propaganda. I hope I made that clear enough before.
					
					And if the surrounding nations had given Israel an overwhelming defeat, I don’t know what they would have done to the Israelis themselves. Dehumanizing the enemy does a lot more than rally the troops. It has long-lasting consequences. At the very least it’s easy to imagine that they might exile all the Israeli Jews; maybe worse. So I’m also not saying that their fears are completely unfounded.
					
					As for “endemic to the culture,” I concede that you’re right that “retaking the Holy land” almost certainly qualifies. When you put it in the context of the crusades, absolutely. I don’t agree that wanting to kill all the Jews is part of that, though.
					
					And I agree that acceptance of Israel hasn’t pervaded the culture. Some level of anti-Israel sentiment is still the norm. When I say “acceptance,” I mean as a fact not as a thing to feel happy about.
					
					And I agree that “oppressor” is perhaps not the right term, because they do embrace the contradictory idea that Israel is at one time both the cowardly pawn of the US and the merciless inflicter of suffering. Although that’s not terribly unusual either; that’s the kind of propaganda you’ll find on the losing side.
					
					So I would never advocate beating her swords into plowshares just yet. I’m only saying that we need to distinguish the propaganda from the reality on the Israeli side. Partly because it’s healthier for Israelis than carrying the full trauma of the Holocaust in the form of a conviction that the next one is right around the corner: you can defend yourself without the necessity of actually being scared sh#tless all the time.
					
					But also to protect Israel from becoming the thing it hates. Hopefully “never again” includes everyone, not just the Jews. And the tragedy of the original Holocaust was that it was made possible in part by convincing everyone that they were doing what they were doing in self defense.
					
					Like bombing hospitals and refugee camps in a population they’ve had completely blockaded for decades, effectively making their land a giant prison, and then cutting off all food, water, and medical care, convinced all the while that this is self defense — that any lesser response would be suicidal.

				It doesn't really matter which side was betrayed the most, that is irrelevant to the national aspirations of both Arab leaders and Jewish leaders.
				
				Inequality at the negotiation table is irrelevant as well. The Arab leaders faced an unfair choice, yes.
				
				Yet it was still a choice: swallow your pride and accept the UN 1947 Partition or reject it and gamble the future of your population in a war you might end up losing.

				He chose the least worst option. Sadly, he paid the ultimate price and history remembers him fondly. Any Arab leader who had accepted the Partition would have been killed by the Arabs. But accepting the partition was the least worst option.

							I'm no historian I'm just an armchair redditor who has friends living in Israel and has had many discussions with people across the political spectrum on the topic. I know the prophet Mohammed said the end times wouldn't come until the Muslims killed all the Jews back in the 7th century, and I know that Muslim states generally allied themselves with the Nazis during World War 2. My understanding is there's not really a time in history since the 7th century where there weren't a variety of Muslim terrorist groups attempting to wipe Jews off the map.

								I mean to be fair everyone's kicked Jews out of everywhere but my point re colonisers was that the Palestinians were living in whatever land you want to call it, then Jews come and talk to your landlord (my understanding is that there was a landlord-tenant system going on in the Ottoman period so no one owned the land they worked despite having multiple generations of kin working/living in it), buy your land which is all fine and legal, but then hold on a second they made an entire sovereign state? I think it was perfectly reasonable for the Arabs living there to want to expel them, probably until maybe 53 when the Egyptians occupied Gaza.

									Yeah I think historically it's pretty messy on who "deserves" the land. I'm much more sympathetic to the Jews because when Israel was created there was pretty much nowhere safe for Jews, the west had Nazism and the middle east had radical islamists, both wanted to exterminate them. Like they needed a state somewhere, the state they were given was where they'd historically been and ethnically cleansed from. But if I was someone who lived there and my ancestors had ethnically cleansed Jews from it but it was all I'd ever known as a home I'd be pretty pissed too.
									
									
									That said I think people today taking the Palestinians side that they deserve Israel have no leg to stand on. They essentially have to argue that the initial expelling of Jews has nothing to do with colonizing and was perfectly legitimate, but the creation of Israel was evil colonization. If colonization gains legitimacy after a few generations, Israel fulfills that criteria, obviously ignoring recent Israeli settlers kicking civilians out of homes in Palestine, I suspect we both believe that's wrong.

	This feels… pretty fair at base.  You did leave out the part where “giving them a home of their own” was actually “giving away land that wasn’t theirs, to immigrants from Europe”, and also skipped the part where Jewish immigrants went around that land poisoning wells and burning homes to displace the people who lived there.  It also leaves off the literal apartheid system Israel has today and has had for decades, where people are given one of four IDs at birth depending on their race and location, and that ID determines where you can and can’t go for the rest of your life.  It leaves off the part where the Israeli government says who can build things — it says no to Arabs pretty much always and brings a bulldozer when they do anyway, while saying yes to Jewish requests across the board and not enforcing violations.  The  list goes on.

	The reason that this is important, is that it creates terrorists.  The difference between “terrorism” and “military action” is often just the difference between having a recognized government vs not.  When your people are oppressed, you fight back.  We often call that “terrorism” when we’re on the other side.  In these cases it is often a matter of perspective.

	So, yes let’s end terrorism.  No innocents should be hurt.  But you saying “eradicate” seems to mean “bomb them away”.  No, that will just create more terrorism.  The solution has to involve Israel stopping and atoning for the things above.  I feel sure that the attacks will get worse as long as Israel is segregating, oppressing, and murdering the population who was there before Israel was.  Even if they flatten Gaza, they will have killed a lot of cousins of all the surrounding countries.

	And killing they are.  How many civilians now?  30k+ dead, with untold numbers seriously injured?  That’s terrorism.

		You also claim that Israel creating difficulties for Palestinians such as denying building requests, creating checkpoints etc creates violence or terrorism, ignoring that the Palestinian Muslims have been fighting the Palestinian Jews (what Israelis used to be called) since before Israel was even a country. 
		
		You also claim that the difference between terrorism and military action is usually only the difference of having a recognized government or not… I again disagree because sending suicide bombers into restaurants and synagogues, intentionally raping and mutilating scores of women on livestream, including tying children up alongside their mothers and then burning them alive would commonly be recognized by the majority of people as terrorism, whether sponsored by a recognized government or not.

For instance it confirms that in 1948 alone, about 75k Jewish people immigrated from Europe, while only about 10k came from “Asia” (incl. Middle East) and Africa.  It seems to confirm that before this there was a significant influx from Europe, though the numbers aren’t as clear.
					
					It did later flip, and in the following years after Israel was established there was a major influx from the Middle East.

								>I’m indigenous to Europe, because my ancestors are from there?
								
								Some highlights of the Jewish claim to Israel:
								
								* We have been there almost **since the beginning** of written history;
								* It has **never been the homeland of any other** independent nation since we first conquered the land - it has always been ours, or under the rule of big and faraway empires (Babylon, Persia, Seleucid, Rome, etc. until we get to the Ottomans and the British);
								* We have **never had another homeland**, we have been considered foreigners anywhere else, paying dearly with life and limb through history;
								* We reigned on the land **longer than anyone else in history** (Israel was under Jewish rule for **1076** years altogether, next come the Turks with 569 years, the Greeks 479, the **Arabs 413** etc);
								* Even after prosecution and mass expulsions, we were **ever present** on the land (for example, according to the ninth-century Muslim historian Baladhuri, at the time of the Muslim conquest of Palestine in the seventh century the **Jews of Caesaria alone** numbered some **200,000** people);
								* We **never stopped trying** to return, there has not been a century in our 2,000 year exile which hasn't seen an [Aliyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah);
								* However widespread we were over the world, we **never forgot** our homeland - we prayed for our return three times daily, after every meal, at every wedding and significant event, we mourned our dispersal three weeks yearly and **every night of the year** in the middle of the night, every household had a charity box to send money to our brethren in Israel, and our biggest wish in life has always been to come back;
								* Not only we, but also **the world has never forgot** where we are coming from and where we are destined to go back - examples range from [Napoleon](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4615236) and [John Adams](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-7097) hoping that Jews return, to [Kant](https://bowman.typepad.com/cubowman/2004/06/an_antisemitic_.html) calling the Jews in his country Palestinians, to - let's not forget - every antisemite over the world telling us non-stop to go back;
								* And much more, but I will stop here.

Defending your land is understandable. Pursuing civilians in anonymous attacks is not honorable. Israel is a military-police state and it’s responses to terrorist attacks has resulted in asymmetric warfare leaving the citizens of Gaza in an open air prison like state.

				Have you looked into the amount of aid money passing into Gaza and the West Bank for the past 35 years? When Yasser Arafat died, he was a billionaire with all of the foreign aid money he siphoned and from the collection of sales taxes collected from Israel after the agreement to do so in the Oslo Accords. (Israel collected sales taxes on goods sold in Gaza and transferred it to Yasser Arafat’s government.
				
				After Hamas took over, this systematic siphoning of aid money has continued. Instead of letting that money go towards the Palestinian state, people or infrastructure it lines the pockets of connected authoritarian leadership. They do not have an incentive to stop the conflict, it’s profitable. If anything, their incentive is to further brainwash the people in Gaza to continue.

					The people in ghaza are probably already pretty negatively disposed towards Israel if they're related in any way to the thousands of Palestinian civilians Israel has killed over the years.
					
					
					The options Palestinians have is pretty perfectly illustrated, peace gets them the west bank and settlers burning their children alive, war gets them ghaza and Israeli soldiers filming themselves looting women's underwear or sleeping in children's cribs and so on.

				>Can you ever truly be a "civilian" after that or are you a "reserve" type person?
				
				So reservist in a different country here.    
				
				Civilians are civilians even if they could theoretically be called in to serve in a draft scenario. They do not lose their protection as civilians even if they have previously served or could be called in to serve in the future.   
				
				Reservists are civilians up until such a time that they are called up to serve, at which point they are expected to wear uniforms like any other combatant. 
				
				There are a lot of rules about who can fight, who is a legitimate combatant, when do people become combatants, etc.   
				Despite what people like to claim (the classic freedom fighter terrorist argument), the rules for who is a combatant, who is a legitimate combatant, and what action is legitimate as an act of war, are all reasonably well defined.    
				And while particular terms like "what qualifies as a ruse de guerre and when does that become a war crime" are more iffy, and can actually depend slightly on what kind of soldier is doing it (spec ops for example often have different rules applied to them).
				
				But in general the rules are fairly clear.  
				For reservists, you are a civilian until you're called up *and* in uniform.

		Arabs should’ve been on their knees begging to have Britain give land to the Jews and let them be a part of it. Jews brought wealth, rights, and prosperity to everyone in Israel. Whereas a Palestinian state would be full of broke Islamist tenant farmers with no education and no future. Palestinians would’ve been able to live peacefully with almost half of them in the prosperity brought by the Jewish state. Instead the Arab states threatened genocide while the Arabs in the mandate declared jihad and started the pogroms. The Nakba was the best option after the Arabs made their genocidal intent clear. Most alternatives lead to the genocide of the Jews.
		
		The Arabs only got more radical after the Nakba. They continue to engage in terrorism despite having a better society than they can realistically hope to achieve on their own due to aid they receive. Even Gaza during the blockade had higher quality of life than Egypt. Palestinians are terrorists because they’re interested in killing Jews. They’ll never forgive the Nakba and it has nothing to do with “apartheid” or settlements. Most are simply genocidally antisemitic monsters who feel entitled to Israel from the river to the sea.
		
		Also if you give Palestinians pipes, concrete, and money, they make rockets, tunnels, and buy weapons instead of making humanitarian infrastructure. What suffering they do experience under “apartheid” is almost entirely of their own making.

		Since 1967, the international community has designated the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as militarily occupied. As long as occupation continues, Israel has the right to protect itself and its citizens from attacks by Palestinians who reside in the occupied territories. However, Israel also has a duty to maintain law and order, also known as “normal life,” within territory it occupies. This obligation includes not only ensuring but prioritizing the security and well-being of the occupied population. That responsibility and those duties are enumerated in Occupation Law. If anything, Israel has a duty to protect Palestinians living under occupation.
		
		So I'd go as far as to say that for Israel the right to initiate militarized force in response to an armed attack, as opposed to police force to restore order, is not a remedy available as they are the occupying state.
		
		Of course they are pushing like hell right now to be the exception...

And yet the occupier is not really succeeding at keeping peace and order because the occupier keeps breaking the rules.

How is that Israel simultaneously exercises control over the territory it occupies and at the same time militarily attacks the territory on the claim that it is “foreign” and poses an exogenous national security threat? In doing precisely that, Israel is asserting rights that may be consistent with colonial domination but simply do not exist under international law.

		The idea that Palestinians only become terrorists because of Israeli occupation is a bad assumption, and not grounded in historical facts. 
		
		1) Palestinians have been fighting wars against Israel for 75 years, well before any occupation.
		
		2) You just have to listen to what they say, they don't say "please leave us alone". They say, "we want our land back". "We want right of return". Those are not statements that have anything to do with occupation. At worst, of course you have Hamas saying they want to eradicate Israel.

	How did Egypt attack Israel in the Suez Crisis? Egypt was well within their rights to nationalize the Suez Canal; this canal is on their land, and they have the right to fully control it. This wouldn't be blocking a shipping lane, the lane would still be open to countries who needed to use it, it just wasn't available for use for Israel, which again is Egypt's right as it's a private waterway, not international waters. 

	The occupation of Gaza by Egypt wasn't something that was meant to be permanent, Egypt had made it clear they had no ambitions to annex Gaza making it sovereign Egyptian territory, like Jordan did with the West Bank. The government setup in Gaza was established by the Arab league, someone had to help manage Gaza at the time and Egypt was the closest neighbor and an ally. Gaza at this time heavily depended on the Egyptian economy for goods.

	If you want to get to the root cause, it's because Israel was created. The Arabs weren't asked about it. Many nations that had their borders drawn by imperialist European nations went to war shortly after independence, and the Israeli conflict doesn't seem different in this regard. 

	What is different however, is that Israel survived the initial wars and has persistent much to the hatred of the Arabs and Muslims.

	>When WWII ended, Zionist in France and England deemed giving European &amp; Middle Eastern Jews a state of the their own. 

	The Balfour Declaration was in 1917, right after Ottomans were defeated in WWI. It supported the creation of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine.  

	The JNF (founded in 1901) and PICA\\PJCA (founded in 1924 when it split from the JCA\\ICA (1897)) were involved in large scale land purchases from absentee land owners in Palestine (the absentee land owners were an result of Ottoman land reforms from the mid 19th century that let rich merchants and other wealthy and powerful people "claim" ownership of large parcels of otherwise occupied land).  One of the largest land purchases, the Sursock purchase happened in the early twenties and involved the purchase of about  two dozen villages (yes, whole villages were sold) displacing a couple thousand families.  You might want to look up the Shaw Commission report from the late 20s that talk about growing Jewish-Arab tensions as a result of Arab displacement and rapid Jewish immigration (there were moderate Palestinian voices who accepted Jewish immigration, but were still unhappy with the volume.) Some Jewish settlements were accepting of Arab workers and selling land to Arabs, others were exclusively for Jews, allowed only Jewish workers, and forbid land sales to any but other Jews).

	>We came to this country which was already populated by Arabs, and we are establishing a Hebrew, that is a Jewish, state here... Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names of the Arab villages, and I do not blame you, because these geography books no longer exists; not only do the books not exist \[but\] the Arab villages are not there either. Nahalal arose in the place of Mahalul, Gvat in the place of Jibta, Sarid in the place of Haneifs, and Kfar Yehoshua in the place of Tell Shaman. There is not one place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population.
  

	
  

	— Moshe Dayan, Haaretz, 4 April 1969

	The villages referenced in Dayan's speech are villages that were sold by foreign, absentee landowners to Jewish settlers and colonists.

	The Peel Commission was the first serious attempt at a partition and creation of an independent Jewish state in 1937, a couple of years before WWII started.  The Peel Commission was in response to increasing violent clashes between the Arabs and the Jews in Palestine (see the Great Revolt 36-39).

	At the end of WWII there were lots of displaced Jews who did not want to return to the places in Europe where they had experienced violence (not so fun fact, it wasn't just the nazi's, many communities had little problem handing the Jews over to the Reich.)   The Jews in Palestine were one of the few welcoming places for those Jews displaced by WWII.  The creation of Israel allowed for an even greater influx of Jewish immigrants\\settlers\\colonists further inflaming the already volatile tensions between the Arabs and the Jews.

	I don't want to change your mind as much as I want you to not sweep away the formative history responsible much of the tension cause by the influx of Jews to that area.  Your summary of this vital time was cursory at best.  There is a ton of information that needs to be known and understood or your lens on the post WWII events is greatly distorted.

	The lie lies in the assumption that the arabs wanted a state without jews and the jews wanted a stae without arabs. That is not what happened. Yes the zionist jews wantes a jewish state, that part is true.

	But the palestinians wanted independence - to everyone who lived there - muslims, arabs and jews. They didn't want to separate anyone, they wanted independence. That doesn't mean they welcomed the jews who came to take their lands under zionist operations, nor did they wanted to give up their lands for refugees. But the jews who were living there - they never wished to exclude them.

	Unlike the jewish state - the arabs never asked for a muslim state, or a christian state ( a lot of them are christian) or a christian+muslim state, or all-religions-except-jews-state. Yes, arab state - for all the arabs that lived there: muslims, christians and jews - like it always has been. They just wanted to end the empirial occupations. Nothing about separating into religions or kicking out one religion. That was entirely the demand of the jews.

	So saying arab fondmentalists are respomsible for the situation is a serious re-write of history.

	I've talked to a lot of Israelis about this. I personally think that a big part of the cycle of violence is that they're too quick to write off the Greater Israel extremists (although that's a very outdated term for them).

	They definitely don't dominate the Israeli government right now, although they have a presence, and that presence is definitely going to plummet after the next election, but there's still a lack of awareness as to the fact that the conflict would have been resolved ten times over if it weren't for these people. This is mostly because of the settlements (which normal Israelis are also too quick to write off), but they did assassinate the Israeli PM once for being too willing to negotiate with the Arabs.

	I say all this because the emotional state of the Arabs has been beyond reason since this conflict started, so there's no point in calling out their greater guilt. There are ways Israel can defuse the situation, and it has a duty to do so (only for the sake of its own people), but that doesn't mean it bears any of the real blame.

Egypt was a sovereign nation, Israel was a state placed in land lived on by others, which was the result of the UN breaking it's own chartered law (UN article 73) to do so. This is nothing to do with comparative military force, rather the destabilising inevitability it represented for the region.   
					
					
					Hell, the zionist terror groups even created a group in the 1930's called the Palmach, which was quite literally a war preparation measure, as they themselves knew the regional neighbours would not accept this happening. Which is why UN article 73 exists, ironically to try and avoid conflicts such as these.  
					
					
					The international governing body broke it's own chartered law, with bias, all the while zionist terror groups were reaping havoc since the 1920's.

In addition there is one glaring omission: you seem to lay the blame at the feet of Palestinian extremists but you make no mention of how Israeli extremists like Netanyahu killed the Palestinian peace process by literally assassinating the Israeli leader who signed the Oslo Accords, yitzhak rabin. Ushering in the Likkud party and the ultra nationalist Israelis.

	To /[u/werterty](https://www.reddit.com/user/werterty), *Your post is under consideration for removal for violating Rule B.*

	

	In our experience, the best conversations genuinely consider the other person’s perspective. Here are some techniques for keeping yourself honest:

	

	- Instead of only looking for flaws in a comment, be sure to engage with the commenters’ strongest arguments — not just their weakest.

	- Steelman rather than strawman. When summarizing someone’s points, look for the most reasonable interpretation of their words.

	- Avoid moving the goalposts. Reread the claims in your OP or first comments and if you need to change to a new set of claims to continue arguing for your position, you might want to consider acknowledging the change in view with a [delta](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=changemyview&amp;utm_content=t5_2w2s8) before proceeding.

	- Ask questions and really try to understand the other side, rather than trying to prove why they are wrong.

	

	Please also take a moment to review our [Rule B](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_b) guidelines and _really_ ask yourself - am I exhibiting any of these behaviors? If so, see what you can do to get the discussion back on track.  Remember, the goal of CMV is to try and **understand** why others think differently than you do.

	I really don't understand why everyone discusses history and the right and wrong of the conflict. The world is not a just place made of butterflies and rainbows. Israel is a nuclear power with world class technology and defense industries. They aren't going anywhere. There will be nuclear world war before the palestinians take over israel. The Palestinians can learn to work with them like other Arab states in the region or they will continue to lead themselves into the ground. Supporting their futile resistance is braindead and does nothing to help them.

	The United Nations proposed a partition of Palestine without legal consultation and in disregard of the existing populations wellbeing and development, no?

	Zionist militias established Israel by force without regard to the partition plans stipulated borders, no?

	Do Jews have a right to self-determination in a territory in which they did not reside but settled? Are Palestinians a nation with the right to self-determination or are they merely a heterogeneous polity of Arabs eligible for minority rights? Did the United Nations have the authority proposed partition in contravention of the will of the local population? Are the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip occupied as a matter of law that is, are they recognized as such by law?

	The villains of this conflict are the Palestinians. Ironically, Palestinians can’t even pronounce “Palestine,” despite their insistence that it exists. They have rejected every peace deal that Israel or the UN offered them. The very idea of peace is foreign to them because so long as Jews remain in the Middle East, the Palestinians will never consider peace. They want a second Holocaust. They want endless, genocidal war with Israel. Israel has realized that if the only language their enemy understands is violence, then they must respond with violence. This conflict will end soon, and Israel will live while “Palestine” will disappear from the world’s memory.

		It’s incredibly ironic to say that the idea of peace is foreign to Palestinians because so long as Jews remain in the Middle East they would not consider it peace before immediately going to say, and seemingly celebrate, that Palestine and Palestinians will “disappear from the world’s memory.”
		
		So it’s fine for Palestinians to be ethnically cleansed but not Israeli’s? How about we just draw the line at ethnically cleansing anyone and you stop speaking like a bloodthirsty maniac?

	I think you are underplaying the power just having the land Israel occupied is. It exerts a huge influence on the sea. As the last true colony of western powers it hugely limits the strength of most Arab nations as it is a constant threat on their borders hence they attack it. This is the geopolitical side to it however there is also a human side which has encouraged fundamentalism. I.e. if there is a common enemy people become extreme. This is why it is not solely a fundamentalist problem. Even if the states were not islamic they would despise Israel as it represents dominance by the west. 

	Aside from that it is rare that a state run based on religion is peaceful as it is a contradiction with other states because the ideologies are fundamentally opposed - whatever they are. The abrahamic god is a jealous God. It is enshrined in text and one cannot truly accept another.

	One thing this post ignores or minimizes is the role extremist Zionism played in these conflicts. Zionism, like all political movements, is not a monolith and there has always been tension between the extremist and moderate wings. The moderates were interested in some type of two state solution but the extremists were clear since the 1800s in their desire to subjugate or expel Palestinians to guarantee Jewish supremacy over the region. This eventually culminated in Vladimir Jabotinsky founding the Revisionist Zionism movement in the 1920s which aimed to maximize Jewish territory and sought to control all of Palestine and present day Jordan. This philosophy would go on to underpin modern day right wing politics in Israel and Likud, Israel’s current ruling party, openly draws inspiration from Revisionist Zionism (though they’ve backed away from RZ’s belief in claiming Jordan).

	Jabotinsky, for his part, was always clear that he viewed creating the nation of Israel as a colonial project that could only be achieved via violent expansionism: 

	>A voluntary reconciliation with the Arabs is out of the question either now or in the future. If you wish to colonize a land in which people are already living, you must provide a garrison for the land, or find some rich man or benefactor who will provide a garrison on your behalf. Or else-or else, give up your colonization, for without an armed force which will render physically impossible any attempt to destroy or prevent this colonization, colonization is impossible, not difficult, not dangerous, but IMPOSSIBLE!… Zionism is a colonization adventure and therefore it stands or falls by the question of armed force.

	So that’s pretty clear right? When you have a prominent political thinker saying things like “voluntary reconciliation is impossible” and talking about how their colonialism will fail without armed force and is saying all of this well before Israel even exists as a state, it makes it clear that his solution prioritizes violence and precludes negotiated peace.

	So all in all, it’s not wrong to place some blame on Islamic extremism for the conflict but you can’t overlook the role extremists Zionism played as well in exacerbating tensions and seeking Jewish supremacy from the start.
