	This reminds me of one of my favourite quotes by Thich Nhat Hanh: "Understanding is love's other name."

	most people don't pay attention, they take other for granted

	Woah, I am really high right now and that's blowing my mind. I had a rough day with one disaster after another. Just when I think I can take a breath, something else happens, equal or worse than the previous thing I just got past. I feel like I am going to shut down soon or have a nervous breakdown with the next impending disaster coming to me in the near future. I am the poster child for the next Murphy's law teaching aid. I'm name dropped in their PowerPoint presentation and referenced in several slides. 

	Genesis has no luck. :(

	Genesis says if it weren't for bad luck I would have no luck at all. :( 

	For example: Genesis goes to the casino for the very first time at almost 40 years old.:)

	She gets $20 in free play. :D

	She goes to a slot machine and the pin pads fucked up. She tries a new machine. XP

	No money on the card. Customer service says it was taken off at the first machine.:(

	She goes to check the first machine. Oh no, it's gone. Someone must have played it, too bad so sad. :'(

	Genesis walks out of the building and is hit by a bus. X$

	Genesis is a perfect example of Murphy's law.  Please discuss why now.

	Thank you for the phenomenal quote that mind fucked me, made me smile, and got me to stop thinking about the overwhelming things going on in my life. You my friend have made my day! Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Never heard it before but it is going to be one of my favorites. I can already tell.

	There's a similar one about the highest compliment you can pay a person is to ask them what they think about something. 

	I knew a man who taught English in China. He once asked one of his twenty-something students about something, "But what do *You* think?" She started to cry and explained when she could that no one had ever asked her opinion about anything before!
