	Are there any domestic consequences for having so many violence inclined soldiers? Like how cops are more likely to be abusive partners? There's no way you can have that many people publicly posting themselves committing war crimes and laughing and still be well adjusted

		I saw a video the other day of a former IDF soldier having a big mental breakdown while telling lawmakers that he is so stressed out financially that he is beating up his wife and has tried to kill her. It didn't seem like anyone was going to handcuff him and lock him up or get his wife out of that situation.

			I know most people might think that people like him might have sympathy for the Palestineans because of the guilt they feel but they don't. They still view them as terrorists and animals. They're just angry at their board committee because of the lack of attention on their psychological and financial issues. They would turn back into the typical racist Israeli once both get resolved.

		Well, statiscally, Israel is one of the most violent countries towards women and children. R\*pe and domestic violence against women and children is very high and usually goes unpunished (see this from [HAARETZ,](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2020-11-24/ty-article/.premium/92-percent-of-rape-investigations-in-israel-are-closed-without-charges/0000017f-e1d0-d9aa-afff-f9d8c3450000) so the very own Israeli media, before CIA/Mossad bots and callcenter operators begin crying and using exclamation marks).  Also, from the very own Israeli press, Israel is known for being the "[pedophiles paradise](https://www.ynetnews.com/article/ByBkeexEI)".

		Does the average slaughterhouse worker suffer from any mental issues as a result of their work? Does the pest control guy? 
		
		An IDF "soldier" can murder a Palestinian Family and sniff their 5 year old daughter's underwear on Saturday and go back to his regular job as a primary school teacher on Monday and do a damn good job. 
		
		My point is, the average Israeli doesn't view Palestinians and Arabs in general as humans.

			This is just one of MANY. Slaughterhouse workers DO have increased mental health issues. 
			
			But when you are slaughtering something that looks like you and talks like you, that you are biologically inclined to see as part of your group.. obviously that is going to get worse. 
			
			Your point is wrong, atleast by your logic and the evidence we've seen in the world. The slaughtering of anyone will invetibly affect those doing the slaughtering. 
			
			Propaganda, praise, hatred, and ambition warp people in massive ways. That is what is happening, that is whats hiding the slaughter warping them too. 
			
			I do agree that the Israeli people don't really see others as people, but that does not make them as good as a slaughterhouse employee. The slaughterhouse employee is just doing work 99% of the time, the Israelis are enjoying it.

Let me tell you white southern society was plagued with violence, “best friends” would commonly get into violent fights over disagreements and sometimes murder each other. You can’t exist in this sort of violent supremacist apartheid system without having your own people turn into savages. It’s not healthy for your society’s psyche, it ends up cannibalizing itself.

	This is really, really, difficult to watch.  Unbelievably disgusting behaviour.  Just absolutely heinous.  Wtf.  Imagine being a person capable of celebrating the murder of children.  It's literal serial killer levels of sadism.  I just don't understand how someone could be so deranged.  But the part that I really can't wrap my head around is how they post videos of themselves acting this way.  Do they honestly think the rest of the world is just gonna be like "ok guys that's super normal behaviour?" Like, who raised you?  That's the one question I have for them.  What kind of lunatic brought you up to be like this?  It's like their parents were all members of the KKK or something.

		They post videos like this because they think it's totally normal behaviour. They have been brainwashed through childhood into thinking it is acceptable to do this to Palestinians. The bit that's nuts for me is the outrage at any harm that comes to an Israeli but complete lack of empathy for the same harm to Palestinians. They then somehow expect the rest of the world to pick their side (eg against Hamas) and are totally shocked when we don't. Their response to that lack of support is that we're all antisemitic, rather than realising it not about picking a side, we just don't agree with genocide. This further demonstrates a massively polarised view of a default good and evil that's totally adrift and has no moral grounding. Its a collective psychosis marked by an insane level of violent racism.

		The best thing would be for the apartheid Zionist state to be completely dismantled and for a new single state established where all people on the land are given equal rights and citizenship. This rogue nation that constantly tries to start regional conflicts and continuously breaks international laws can't be trusted to hold a seat on the UN, let alone have an overly-funded military.
		
		We can look at history. It wouldn't have been acceptable to have two states after WW2 where the Nazis were allowed to keep their state. Also Apartheid South Africa, it wouldn't have been acceptable for the Afrikaners in power to keep their oppressive state as well.
		
		Although I understand at this point and I agree, that a separate Palestinian state is much better than the system of oppression they've endured for decades now under their colonizers. But I just wanted to make clear what the ideal humanitarian goal is.

			If they do end up going the way of South Africa hopefully they learn from its mistakes. It has been a complete dismantling and Nuremberg level trials. Everything has to change, and a lot of land has to be forcefully repatriated to Palestinians. Or else it ends up like SA where the afrikaners even today own 80% of all the land and all of the industries. Political representation without economic representation will mean very little. It’ll just become defacto apartheid instead of de jure apartheid.

			Isreal is not an aparthied state, you can stop with the sjw performamce art. Almost 30% of Israel is  Arab population that can vote, go to schools and participate in politics. They don't even serve in the IDF but can choose to (many arabs do).  Oct 7 which was on the Jewish holiday of Sukkot happened because Israel and Saudi Arabia were about to sign a peace deal. Egypt, Sudan, Morocco normalized relations with Israel  the last 3 years, so your aparthied narrative is nonsense.  I'm African, stop using aparthied as a way to peddle your agenda. Your country treats it's black people like total shit.  Arabs don't have ID cards of what tribe they are, nor are there posters stating youll be shoot sundown if you're native or colour. 
			
			Meanwhile you have actual aparthied and slavery is going on throughout  the middle east. I dont see you protesting to stop the genocide I Sudan, mainly because they are black and you cant use them. Israel isn't an aparthied state and Africans are getting tired of self entitled white kids who don't know shit using what we we though.

	Nazi Germany once was on top of the world, and now the embers of their fascism is still burning under the façade they created to distance themselves from what once defined their whole country, FASCISM.  

	Now Israel and zionists are the same, they think they can do what they want because they have the unequivocal support of some warmongering western countries.   

	One day soon, history will look at this period of time they were in power and spent their time committing genocides with impunity, just like it looks at Nazi Germany.  

	Will it be too late? Perhaps. Will it teach human beings anything? Unlikely. But will it last? Not a chance.  

	Not a single empire throughout history was immortal, they all fall one day, and the fall of this whole "civilized western democracy" is coming. A lot of these countries are split in half in terms of politics, and now they are supporting fascism and genocide and making a lot of other people unhappy.  

	People have 2 choices at best for who wants to run their country and both choices results in the same thing anyways with minor differences.

	My thoughts on zionists words are......🤡🤣🤡🤣🤡🤣🤡🤣🤡🤣🤡🤣🤡🤣🤡🤣🤡🤣🤡🤣🤡🤣🤡🤣

	Disclaimer: I in no way find the genocide against the Palestinians funny.  It is sickening!  I find the zionists words however to be a load of bull 💩.  They want us angry so they can cry 'antisemitism', a word that has lost its weight.  So laugh at them

	🤡🤣🤡 😉

	Israel would not be possible without Britain and the United States, Britain for establishing Israel as a Zionist colonial project, and the United States for vigorously maintaining it.  I strongly believe that the rebirth of Israel was not years in the making, nor was it decades, but **centuries**.  And it has **everything** to do with the rebuilding of Solomon’s Temple, for which Israel already has three red heifers at an undisclosed location, ready for the sacrifice that will commence the rebuilding of the Temple (obviously over what will eventually be the ruins of Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, both of which were built over the ruins of the Temple after the Romans destroyed it).  America’s Founding Fathers brought with them the British legacy of Freemasonry, which is so deeply rooted in the architecture and practices of Solomon’s Temple, that the Masonic lodge is patterned after Solomon’s Temple itself, right down to the checkered floor and the twin pillars Jachin and Boaz.  The elites of this world were and are still **hell-bent** on rebuilding the Temple.  And in my opinion, **it has absolutely nothing to do with any kind of Messianic prophecy**.

	Some of this footage is not from Gaza, the malnourished children is footage from Yemen, not from this year.

		So the message here is stop starving/killing children! 
		
		Honestly This world is a mess! 
		
		Words can’t explain the anguish I feel seeing this happening daily and nobody stopping it!

			The extremely malnourished child - I think it’s from 2020. A lot of footage collages like this are from different conflicts.
			
			If the message is playing mostly at your emotions, it’s safe to assume there’s an element of receipt. If the message is mostly focused on sourced facts, it tries to appeal to the rational side. However, we are not robots and emotions take precedence.
			It’s fine to have compassion, but also there’s a need to realize when we’re being fooled.

	They have so much crime amongst their own people sexual assault Of their own soldiers, PTSD, Most of the settlers are poor misfits. They couldn't make it in their own country so they settled, for the free houses that they had to steal. So their character is already an issue that's destroying and affecting the rest of the Israeli community.
