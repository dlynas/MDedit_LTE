	"It's time to start asking what your country can do for you" was not just a devastating slogan, but a wakeup call about what our attitude toward the government can and should be.

	I hope this means we dismiss the lie that good policy needs bi-partisan approval from republicans. Since they've indisputably proven their values aren't grounded in reality and no amount of olive branches are going deter their war against good governence.

		I hope this means you dismiss the lie that representative democracy is possible under any system that enforces a two party system. You need proportional democracy. You have 360 million people and a hell of alot more than two political perspectives. And it adds to binary thinking on complex issues.

			Thank you. Our country was never founded to be a two party system. The founders never envisioned it. They had too much faith in the independence of men. Now it's funny to me that people think membership to a political party is patriotic.

			Excellent point. I try to bring up the [Ranked Choice Voting](https://www.fairvote.org) initiatives whenever I can. Even most conservatives I talk to support this principle, so any amount of support per-your state or region would go a long way. I know that the method they use isn't appealing to the super-nerdy math and poly-sci crew, but dammit it worked in Canada, it'll work here!

	* 🟨 **[page_one](https://www.reddit.com/user/page_one)** ⬆️ 12 _(2020-09-03 17:39:32)_

		Consider this: Maybe the reason why Pelosi and Schumer haven't created a liberal utopia yet isn't because they don't want to. Maybe it's because they're working within a very slow, complicated, and conservative-favoring system.
		
		Young progressives love to imagine they could just swoop into a government office and solve everything by the end of the day. And they have the luxury of imagining that because they don't know how government actually works.
		
		And then consider what happens when you throw out all of your experienced leaders and are left trying to navigate these systems with no expertise, trying to craft legislation you don't understand, and win the votes of constituents whose demands you disregard.

								Okay, so let's run a campaign attacking anyone with any conservative-leaning views. If we're lucky we can steer Bernie to yet another second-place victory.
								
								The unfortunate reality is that the United States is a conservative-leaning country. You cannot win without appealing to and welcoming voters from the center. Frustrating as that is, deny it and you'll only dig your own grave.

									I didn't say attack, just ignore them. You're saying that you HAVE to appeal to those people to win. If that's the case then why to the Democrats keep doing it and losing?  
									
									2000 - Al Gore with literal Independent as Running mate runs centrist campaign. Loses.  
									2004 - Kerry. Centrist appeal to conservative voters campaign. Loses.  
									2008 - Bold progressive. Hope and change. Change we can believe in. Barrack Obama wins.  
									2016 - Centrist appeals to conservative voters. Chuck Schumer literally says "for every blue collar Democrat we lose" etc, etc. Loses.

										You're reducing all the intricacies of nationwide elections to just the single variable of whether or not the Democratic candidate is appealing to centrist voters...
										
										... solely based on reducing the entirety of Obama's victory to messaging that appealed to progressives, a variable which does not even contrast with whether appeal to centrists exists.
										
										You must agree that this is not a very good take.

				With all due respect, how much experience or education do you have about how American government works? Your explanation is a broad oversimplification and doesn't reflect how our government is structured. Our government was made to require general consensus to do big things, and that's hard to get.

				* 🟪 **[xxbiohazrdxx](https://www.reddit.com/user/xxbiohazrdxx)** ⬆️ 5 _(2020-09-03 20:22:41)_

					Marijuana legalization has like 80%+ support among D and 60%+ Support among Republicans. Yet neither candidate (nor their respective party apparatus) has that as a policy platform.  
					
					If "general consensus" was all that was required to do things then we would already have decriminalized marijuana, have universal healthcare (or more likely a public option), etc..  
					
					The reason we don't have those things is not due to a lack of "general consensus" its because those goals don't align with the priorities of the ruling elite.

								As I said before, that's a broad oversimplification, and isn't even really accurate. Structural change is meant to be difficult in our government. The founders intentionally put in multiple veto points for legislation that could prevent it from being enacted.

	Until you get 60 democrats in the senate or bring back the ear mark incrementalism is all we are going to get.  If you think getting rid of the filibuster is a good idea just for one second imagine the damage that Trump and Co would have done in their first two years; women's right to choose, gone, environmental laws gone, immigration gone, equality laws gone, voting rights gone.  IF you think it's a hellscape now you have no idea and sure the next president could undo a lot of these laws but then next president would put them right back.  Republicans are relentless and will do anything to send us socially back to the 50's and give our last penny to their rich cronies -even for only two years the damage could be irreparable.

		I don't know, from my point of view progressives are the reason republicans dont win. Obama ran as a progressive and was given the finger 2 years later when it was found out he wasn't (either for lack of trying or obstructions, your choice). Then in 2018 it was progressives riled up mostly because of Bernie, and we saw records breaking left and right. So it seems to me, centrists will vote along party lines almost no matter what, but progressives need purity tests.

			He passed the exact healthcare law that he ran on.  So if he ran as a progressive, that means his healthcare law was progressive, which means in the first two years he governed as a progressive.  The Republicans won because Democrats always have lower turnout in midterms, not because people were disillusioned with Obama.  In fact it was the members of Congress who tried to distance themselves from Obama that lost.  And the 2018 win had nothing to do with Sanders.

	People should also note that Kennedy won more voters among working class districts  and  overwhemingly won districts with high POC populations. Markey won among districts with higher income, as we call here "Whole food districts".Progressives should stop saying they have hit the nerve of working class, there is no evidence to prove that.Bernie also just won in college towns and lost elsewhere. And Biden won rural, small town working class people along with suburbs.Anti democratic party progressives won't win presidency or a Senate race, mark my words.Be like Marrkey or Mrs Baldwin. They don't shit on party.

			**Markey's Dominance In Boston Practically Neutralized Kennedy's Strength In Gateway Cities**
			
			Kennedy, despite his family's wealth and privilege, connected with working-class voters throughout the campaign. His effort paid off in Gateway Cities — mid-sized municipalities where the median household income and rate of bachelor's degree holders are both below state averages.
			
			There are [26 Gateway Cities](https://massinc.org/our-work/policy-center/gateway-cities/about-the-gateway-cities/#:~:text=The%20Legislature%20defines%2026%20Gateway,%2C%20Springfield%2C%20Taunton%2C%20Westfield%2C) in Massachusetts; Kennedy won 21 of them, including Brockton, Lawrence, New Bedford and Springfield. One of the few that Markey picked up was his hometown of Malden.
			
			Kennedy's total margin of victory in Gateway Cities was 28,469 votes.
			
			But Markey practically neutralized those many defeats with a win in just one place: Boston. He romped by 25,033 votes in the state capital, with 60% support.

					No one takes a statement like this, phrased the way it is, as a statement about the way things *are* but as a statement of what the person thinks *ought to be*.

	This was for the best, Markey can help shape the current system, and hopefully this loss humbles Kennedy. He wasn't a terrible candidate, but he moved to quick. He'll be a senator one day, but I hope this loss allows him to look at how to fix his platforms for the future.

		Even Obama got has ass handed to him by Bobby Rush.  Now is not Kennedys' time.  In all honesty I hope he goes another direction, I'm not a fan of dynasties in politics; isn't that why we split with England in the first place and yet the Republicans can't get back to a monarchy fast enough.

	Yes, they are ready to simply declare the U.S. Constitution as invalid and simply impose a total dictatorship. with Trump, Barr and Pompeo at the head of government and a majority of Judges on their side, they will win.

				in context, Biden said this to a group of wealthy people, in secret.
				
				therein lay the problem.  
				
				Biden, by saying this, is assuring comfort to the comfortable; and the afflicted will remain afflicted. 
				
				Biden has not corrected these words; and he has not spoken to the poor about their lives becoming better. 
				
				that is the context.
