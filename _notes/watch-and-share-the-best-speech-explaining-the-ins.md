## Watch and share. The best
speech explaining the insane paranoia of
Zionists and how it justifies their racism,
colonialism and treatment of
Palestinians which we are witnessing today on our screens with their own words.
Brilliantly explained by Gideon Levy

"I'll just give the three principles which enable us,
Israelis, to live so easily with this brutal reality.
A, most of the Israelis, if not all of them,
deeply believe that we are the chosen people.
And if we are the chosen people,
we have the right to do whatever we want.
B, there were more brutal occupations in history.
There were even longer occupations in history,
even though the Israeli occupation gets
to quite a nice record.
But there was never in history an occupation in which
the occupier presented himself as the victim.
Not only the victim, the only victim around.
This also enabled any Israeli to live in peace
because we are the victims.
The other day, Professor Falk spoke about this dual
strategy of Israel of being a victim on one hand
and manipulating the other hand.
After what happened in Paris and in Copenhagen
with the terror attacks, Benjamin Etaniaw came with the notion
all the Jews must come to Israel.
It's the safest place for the Jews in the world.
It's a shelter for the Jews in the world, which is wrong
because Israel is today the most dangerous place
on Earth for Jews.
But let's put it aside.
It was only 24 hours later when Israel is an existential threat
under the Iranian bomb and asked myself,
how can you dare call Jews to come and to join this
to a side of the project when the Iranians are going
to bomb us?
But in Israel everything goes and boasts the creation.
The Russians were accepted as the only Jews.
And here I get to the third set of values
which enable us Israelis to live in peace with their occupation.
And this is maybe the most crucial one and the worst one.
We say victimization.
We say chosen people.
When I say victimization, it goes without saying,
we have to mention the Holocaust and the unforgettable Mrs.
Gorda Meir that the American jury had exported to Israel.
She said once, this unforgettable woman
that after the Holocaust, the Jews
didn't have the right to do whatever they want.
But the third set of values is the most dangerous one.
And this is the systematic dehumanization
of the Palestinians which enable us Israelis
to live in peace with everything.
Because if they are not human beings like us,
then there is not really a question of human rights.
And if you're scratch under the skin of almost every Israeli,
you will find it there.
Almost no one will treat the Palestinians as equal human beings
like us.
I once wrote that we treat the Palestinians like animals
and I got so many protest letters from animal rights
organizations, rightly so.
But by the end of the day, how many Israelis
did ever try for a moment to put themselves
in the place of the Palestinians for a moment, for one day?
And I want to give you two examples which we demonstrated.
Many years ago, I interviewed then candidate
for Prime Minister Eud Barak.
And I asked him a question which I tried to ask in any occasion.
Mr. Barak, what would have happened
if you would have been born in Palestinian?
And Barak gave me then the only honest answer he could give me.
He said I would have joined the terror organization.
What else would have he done?
Would he become a poet?
He doesn't know to write poems.
Would he become a pianist?
He's quite a bad pianist.
And I doubt if he would have become a collaborator
because he is a fighter.
And it became a scandal.
Because how can you dare to put Eud Barak to think
what would have happened if he would have become a Palestinian?
And the second incident, briefly,
secondly, the father, the city of Jainin,
the most close city in the West Bank, real total siege.
I go out from Jainin.
I come to the checkpoint.
A Palestinian ambulance is parking there with the red lights.
I stand after him.
No cars can get out of Jainin in those days.
No cars can get in.
And I wait.
The soldiers are playing better more in the tent.
Usually I know myself.
It's better that I don't get into a confrontation with the soldiers
because it always ends up very badly.
So I stayed in the car.
But after 40 minutes, I couldn't take it.
And I went out to the car from the car.
I went first to the Palestinian ambulance.
I asked him, what's going on?
He told me that's the routine.
They let me wait one hour until they come and check the ambulance.
And I couldn't take it anymore.
And I went to the soldiers.
It became a confrontation.
But the question that they asked that which really brought them
to direct their weapons, that was me, was one.
What would have happened if your father
would have been lying in this ambulance?
This freaked them out.
They lost control.
How can I dare to compare between their father
and the Palestinian in the ambulance?
And this set of beliefs that they are not human beings like us
and able us, Israelis, to live in so much peace
with those crimes, ongoing crime for so many years,
with losing any kind of humanity, humanity, values.
I heard today people talk about Jewish values.
I must be frank with you.
I don't know what are Jewish values.
I know what are universal values.
Let's not get into it really.
APPLAUSE
They are very clear universal values.
And there is a very, very clear international law.
But for most of the Israelis, international law
is very important.
But not for Israel.
Israel is a special case.
Why is it a special case?
And again, you get with all those set of values,
with this living in denial.
And here I want to get back to the topic of our panel.
Is it good for Israel?
No, it's very corrupting.
Because as long as the United States and able Israel
to continue, obviously the Palestinians
are the first and direct, unbelievable victim of it.
But by the end of the day, what will Israel be after all those years?
What is it already today?
When does it, where does it direct to?
And things are getting worse and worse.
And therefore I have so little hope about change
from within the Israeli society.
Because it thinks as you might know,
I'm going more and more to the nationalistic,
militaristic, religious direction,
with very little hope that change will come from within.
Why would Israelis go for a change?
What incentive?
Why would they bother?
I feel so good.
You should have seen Israel in the days when Gaza was bombed.
When the beaches were crowded, the helicopters
were passing on the way to bomb Gaza.
The Israeli TV hardly showed photos from there.
News papers hardly wrote anything.
I wrote one article about the responsibility of the pilots
and I needed to use bodyguards to get out of my home after this.
The problem was by the way that the bodyguards were settlers
and they argued with me all day long until I saw
that I'm much more secure without the bodyguards
rather than with them.
But the last war in Gaza,
and this will be my final remarks,
the last war in Gaza taught us also that Israel,
which has three regimes today.
Maybe the only country in the only state in the world
with three regimes, one for the Jews,
one for the Arab citizens and one and a part had regime
in the West Bank and Gaza, one of the most brutal
and cruel tyrannies in the world.
But even for the facade, even for this democracy,
which I all resort is democracy for its Jewish citizens,
I realized last summer that it is a democracy
for its Jewish citizens,
but only if they think like the majority.
And therefore, and by this I want to conclude,
I want to tell you all that few of us,
very few, much to few,
but few of us are looking to the West,
Europe and then United States with a great hope
because we lost hope in Israel.
Thank you very much.
Well, now I'm afraid we're going to need a bodyguard
to help you leave.
I'm watching Tundisi.
Thank you very much for your remarks."
