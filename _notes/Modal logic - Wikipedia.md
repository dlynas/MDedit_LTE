**Modal logic** is a kind of [logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") used to represent statements about [necessity and possibility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modality_(natural_language) "Modality (natural language)"). It plays a major role in [philosophy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") and related fields as a tool for understanding concepts such as [knowledge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge"), [obligation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obligation "Obligation"), and [causation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality "Causality"). For instance, in [epistemic modal logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_modal_logic "Epistemic modal logic"), the [formula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula "Well-formed formula") ![{\displaystyle \Box P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d30b6d37f2d650ad3011989f5477df0536bed7d1) can be used to represent the statement that ![{\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) is known. In [deontic modal logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_modal_logic "Deontic modal logic"), that same formula can represent that ![{\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) is a moral obligation.

Modal logic considers the inferences that modal statements give rise to. For instance, most epistemic modal logics treat the formula ![{\displaystyle \Box P\rightarrow P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0b3b02ccf3ccced20b699f7aeec348ebf40d887d) as a [tautology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic) "Tautology (logic)"), representing the principle that only true statements can count as knowledge. However, this formula is not a tautology in deontic modal logic, since what ought to be true can be false.

Modal logics are [formal systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system "Formal system") that include [unary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation "Unary operation") operators such as ![{\displaystyle \Diamond }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e5e6f31a91de53f443e2cd4c7478693a1a6a57b) and ![{\displaystyle \Box }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/029b77f09ebeaf7528fc831fe57848be51f2240b), representing possibility and necessity respectively. For instance the modal formula ![{\displaystyle \Diamond P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c11ced51ad343c329a468b33e5139a99306fd0b6) can be read as "possibly ![{\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a)" while ![{\displaystyle \Box P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d30b6d37f2d650ad3011989f5477df0536bed7d1) can be read as "necessarily ![{\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a)". In the standard [relational semantics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_semantics "Kripke semantics") for modal logic, formulas are assigned truth values relative to a _[possible world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world "Possible world")_. A formula's truth value at one possible world can depend on the truth values of other formulas at other [_accessible_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility_relation "Accessibility relation") [possible worlds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_worlds "Possible worlds"). In particular, ![{\displaystyle \Diamond P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c11ced51ad343c329a468b33e5139a99306fd0b6) is true at a world if ![{\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) is true at _some_ accessible possible world, while ![{\displaystyle \Box P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d30b6d37f2d650ad3011989f5477df0536bed7d1) is true at a world if ![{\displaystyle P}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) is true at _every_ accessible possible world. A variety of proof systems exist which are sound and complete with respect to the semantics one gets by restricting the accessibility relation. For instance, the deontic modal logic **D** is sound and complete if one requires the accessibility relation to be [serial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_relation "Serial relation").

While the intuition behind modal logic dates back to antiquity, the first modal [axiomatic systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system "Axiomatic system") were developed by [C. I. Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._I._Lewis "C. I. Lewis") in 1912. The now-standard relational semantics emerged in the mid twentieth century from work by [Arthur Prior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Prior "Arthur Prior"), [Jaakko Hintikka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaakko_Hintikka "Jaakko Hintikka"), and [Saul Kripke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke "Saul Kripke"). Recent developments include alternative [topological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology") semantics such as [neighborhood semantics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_semantics "Neighborhood semantics") as well as applications of the relational semantics beyond its original philosophical motivation.<sup id="cite_ref-bluebible_1-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-bluebible-1">[1]</a></sup> Such applications include [game theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory "Game theory"),<sup id="cite_ref-openminds_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-openminds-2">[2]</a></sup> [moral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_theory "Moral theory") and [legal theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_theory "Legal theory"),<sup id="cite_ref-openminds_2-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-openminds-2">[2]</a></sup> [web design](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design "Web design"),<sup id="cite_ref-openminds_2-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-openminds-2">[2]</a></sup> [multiverse-based set theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse_(set_theory) "Multiverse (set theory)"),<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> and [social epistemology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_epistemology "Social epistemology").<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

## Syntax of modal operators [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Syntax of modal operators")

Modal logic differs from other kinds of logic in that it uses modal [operators](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(mathematics) "Operator (mathematics)") such as ![{\displaystyle \Box }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/029b77f09ebeaf7528fc831fe57848be51f2240b) and ![{\displaystyle \Diamond }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e5e6f31a91de53f443e2cd4c7478693a1a6a57b). The former is conventionally read aloud as "necessarily", and can be used to represent notions such as moral or legal [obligation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obligation "Obligation"), [knowledge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge"), [historical inevitability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism"), among others. The latter is typically read as "possibly" and can be used to represent notions including [permission](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permission_(philosophy) "Permission (philosophy)"), [ability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ability "Ability"), compatibility with [evidence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence "Evidence"). While [well-formed formulas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula "Well-formed formula") of modal logic include non-modal formulas such as ![{\displaystyle P\land Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c5690bb4822d8c821a00cfe3c6644b046a884af4), it also contains modal ones such as ![{\displaystyle \Box (P\land Q)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3e96eab4e03e07964f217e040060cd56380d34fb), ![{\displaystyle P\land \Box Q}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66790dc083b5bffa9d6d4df54fedee56a5aefe98), ![{\displaystyle \Box (\Diamond P\land \Diamond Q)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/391e5de9efbc166dc05a760ced8a9ed8812ce8b0), and so on.

Thus, the [language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_(logic) "Language (logic)") ![{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9027196ecb178d598958555ea01c43157d83597c) of basic [propositional logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic "Propositional logic") can be [defined recursively](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_definition "Recursive definition") as follows.

1.  If ![{\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) is an atomic formula, then ![{\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) is a formula of ![{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9027196ecb178d598958555ea01c43157d83597c).
2.  If ![{\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) is a formula of ![{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9027196ecb178d598958555ea01c43157d83597c), then ![{\displaystyle \neg \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d3977176cb0f5057b3dcc1cfeae7d80dcb9c9ee0) is too.
3.  If ![{\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) and ![{\displaystyle \psi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/45e5789e5d9c8f7c79744f43ecaaf8ba42a8553a) are formulas of ![{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9027196ecb178d598958555ea01c43157d83597c), then ![{\displaystyle \phi \land \psi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8df1d0ec9b8a26c36c9190258a221ebf90496329) is too.
4.  If ![{\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) is a formula of ![{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9027196ecb178d598958555ea01c43157d83597c), then ![{\displaystyle \Diamond \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a66fbb65d563e99aa91360d0da21ee6637080ea9) is too.
5.  If ![{\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) is a formula of ![{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9027196ecb178d598958555ea01c43157d83597c), then ![{\displaystyle \Box \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bac6d8e20bfba09462096d4f815c14b676e4b2f4) is too.

Modal operators can be added to other kinds of logic by introducing rules analogous to #4 and #5 above. Modal [predicate logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_logic "Predicate logic") is one widely used variant which includes formulas such as ![{\displaystyle \forall x\Diamond P(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/47934f6957b3d303a79d3e232dbc297e8706da01). In systems of modal logic where ![{\displaystyle \Box }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/029b77f09ebeaf7528fc831fe57848be51f2240b) and ![{\displaystyle \Diamond }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e5e6f31a91de53f443e2cd4c7478693a1a6a57b) are [duals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(mathematics) "Dual (mathematics)"), ![{\displaystyle \Box \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bac6d8e20bfba09462096d4f815c14b676e4b2f4) can be taken as an abbreviation for ![{\displaystyle \neg \Diamond \neg \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e8bbe88940caa6488546b70319a25cea5d7cab18), thus eliminating the need for a separate syntactic rule to introduce it. However, separate syntactic rules are necessary in systems where the two operators are not interdefinable.

Common notational variants include symbols such as ![{\displaystyle [K]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b6c25071903364b1b51e69ffa99ec95f6d122d5) and ![{\displaystyle \langle K\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/67dd7c8db00c88d8d6cd0ed160174fd443aaf767) in systems of modal logic used to represent knowledge and ![{\displaystyle [B]}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6e6c6caf9d188e4a608dfdac98bbcd140a9ea106) and ![{\displaystyle \langle B\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1f6899df7d29a750dfd0b4047230fe9768064f3b) in those used to represent belief. These notations are particularly common in systems which use multiple modal operators simultaneously. For instance, a combined epistemic-deontic logic could use the formula   read as "I know P is permitted". Systems of modal logic can include infinitely many modal operators distinguished by indices, i.e.  ,  ,  , and so on.

## Semantics [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Semantics")

### Relational semantics [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Relational semantics")

#### Basic notions [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Basic notions")

The standard semantics for modal logic is called the _relational semantics_. In this approach, the truth of a formula is determined relative to a point which is often called a _[possible world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world "Possible world")_. For a formula that contains a modal operator, its truth value can depend on what is true at other [accessible](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility_relation "Accessibility relation") worlds. Thus, the relational semantics interprets formulas of modal logic using [models](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(logic) "Model (logic)") defined as follows.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

-   A _relational model_ is a tuple   where:

1.    is a set of possible worlds
2.    is a binary relation on  
3.    is a valuation function which assigns a truth value to each pair of an atomic formula and a world, (i.e.   where   is the set of atomic formulae)

The set   is often called the _universe_. The binary relation   is called an [accessibility relation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility_relation "Accessibility relation"), and it controls which worlds can "see" each other for the sake of determining what is true. For example,   means that the world   is accessible from world  . That is to say, the [state of affairs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_affairs_(philosophy) "State of affairs (philosophy)") known as   is a live possibility for  . Finally, the function   is known as a [valuation function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Valuation_function&action=edit&redlink=1 "Valuation function (page does not exist)"). It determines which [atomic formulas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_formula "Atomic formula") are true at which worlds.

Then we recursively define the truth of a formula at a world   in a model  :

-     iff  
-     iff  
-     iff   and  
-     iff for every element   of  , if   then  
-     iff for some element   of  , it holds that   and  

According to this semantics, a formula is _necessary_ with respect to a world   if it holds at every world that is accessible from  . It is _possible_ if it holds at some world that is accessible from  . Possibility thereby depends upon the accessibility relation  , which allows us to express the relative nature of possibility. For example, we might say that given our laws of physics it is not possible for humans to travel faster than the speed of light, but that given other circumstances it could have been possible to do so. Using the accessibility relation we can [translate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_translation "Logic translation") this scenario as follows: At all of the worlds accessible to our own world, it is not the case that humans can travel faster than the speed of light, but at one of these accessible worlds there is _another_ world accessible from _those_ worlds but not accessible from our own at which humans can travel faster than the speed of light.

#### Frames and completeness [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Frames and completeness")

The choice of accessibility relation alone can sometimes be sufficient to guarantee the truth or falsity of a formula. For instance, consider a model   whose accessibility relation is [reflexive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation "Reflexive relation"). Because the relation is reflexive, we will have that   for any   regardless of which valuation function is used. For this reason, modal logicians sometimes talk about _frames_, which are the portion of a relational model excluding the valuation function.

-   A _relational frame_ is a pair   where   is a set of possible worlds,   is a binary relation on  .

The different systems of modal logic are defined using _frame conditions_. A frame is called:

-   **[reflexive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation "Reflexive relation")** if _w R w_, for every _w_ in _G_
-   **[symmetric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation "Symmetric relation")** if _w R u_ implies _u R w_, for all _w_ and _u_ in _G_
-   **[transitive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation "Transitive relation")** if _w R u_ and _u R q_ together imply _w R q_, for all _w_, _u_, _q_ in _G_.
-   **[serial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_relation "Serial relation")** if, for every _w_ in _G_ there is some _u_ in _G_ such that _w R u_.
-   **[Euclidean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_relation "Euclidean relation")** if, for every _u_, _t_, and _w_, _w R u_ and _w R t_ implies _u R t_ (by symmetry, it also implies _t R u_, as well as _t R t_ and _u R u_)

The logics that stem from these frame conditions are:

-   _K_ := no conditions
-   _D_ := serial
-   _T_ := reflexive
-   _B_ := reflexive and symmetric
-   _S4_ := [reflexive and transitive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preorder "Preorder")
-   _[S5](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S5_(modal_logic) "S5 (modal logic)")_ := reflexive and [Euclidean](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_relation "Euclidean relation")

The Euclidean property along with reflexivity yields symmetry and transitivity. (The Euclidean property can be obtained, as well, from symmetry and transitivity.) Hence if the accessibility relation _R_ is reflexive and Euclidean, _R_ is provably [symmetric](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation "Symmetric relation") and [transitive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation "Transitive relation") as well. Hence for models of S5, _R_ is an [equivalence relation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation"), because _R_ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

We can prove that these frames produce the same set of valid sentences as do the frames where all worlds can see all other worlds of _W_ (_i.e._, where _R_ is a "total" relation). This gives the corresponding _modal graph_ which is total complete (_i.e._, no more edges (relations) can be added). For example, in any modal logic based on frame conditions:

  if and only if for some element _u_ of _G_, it holds that   and _w R u_.

If we consider frames based on the total relation we can just say that

  if and only if for some element _u_ of _G_, it holds that  .

We can drop the accessibility clause from the latter stipulation because in such total frames it is trivially true of all _w_ and _u_ that _w R u_. But this does not have to be the case in all S5 frames, which can still consist of multiple parts that are fully connected among themselves but still disconnected from each other.

All of these logical systems can also be defined axiomatically, as is shown in the next section. For example, in S5, the axioms  ,   and   (corresponding to _symmetry_, _transitivity_ and _reflexivity_, respectively) hold, whereas at least one of these axioms does not hold in each of the other, weaker logics.

### Topological semantics [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Topological semantics")

Modal logic has also been interpreted using topological structures. For instance, the _Interior Semantics_ interprets formulas of modal logic as follows.

A _topological model_ is a tuple   where   is a [topological space](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") and   is a valuation function which maps each atomic formula to some subset of  . The basic interior semantics interprets formulas of modal logic as follows:

-     iff  
-     iff  
-     iff   and  
-     iff for some   we have both that   and also that   for all  

Topological approaches subsume relational ones, allowing [non-normal modal logics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-normal_modal_logic "Non-normal modal logic"). The extra structure they provide also allows a transparent way of modeling certain concepts such as the evidence or justification one has for one's beliefs. Topological semantics is widely used in recent work in formal epistemology and has antecedents in earlier work such as [David Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher) "David Lewis (philosopher)") and [Angelika Kratzer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelika_Kratzer "Angelika Kratzer")'s logics for [counterfactuals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactuals "Counterfactuals").

## Axiomatic systems [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Axiomatic systems")

 [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_of_Normal_Modal_Logics.png)

Diagram of common modal logics; **K4W** stands for [Provability logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provability_logic "Provability logic"), and **B** on the top corner stands for [Brouwer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._E._J._Brouwer "L. E. J. Brouwer")'s system of **KTB**

The first formalizations of modal logic were [axiomatic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic "Axiomatic"). Numerous variations with very different properties have been proposed since [C. I. Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._I._Lewis "C. I. Lewis") began working in the area in 1912. [Hughes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Edward_Hughes "George Edward Hughes") and [Cresswell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_John_Cresswell "Max John Cresswell") (1996), for example, describe 42 [normal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_modal_logic "Normal modal logic") and 25 non-normal modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes some systems Hughes and Cresswell omit.

Modern treatments of modal logic begin by augmenting the [propositional calculus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus "Propositional calculus") with two unary operations, one denoting "necessity" and the other "possibility". The notation of [C. I. Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Irving_Lewis "Clarence Irving Lewis"), much employed since, denotes "necessarily _p_" by a prefixed "box" (□_p_) whose [scope](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(logic) "Scope (logic)") is established by parentheses. Likewise, a prefixed "diamond" (◇_p_) denotes "possibly _p_". Similar to the [quantifiers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantifier_(logic) "Quantifier (logic)") in [first-order logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic "First-order logic"), "necessarily _p_" (□_p_) does not assume the [range of quantification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantifier_(logic)#Range_of_quantification "Quantifier (logic)") (the set of accessible possible worlds in [Kripke semantics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_semantics "Kripke semantics")) to be non-empty, whereas "possibly _p_" (◇_p_) often implicitly assumes   (viz. the set of accessible possible worlds is non-empty). Regardless of notation, each of these operators is definable in terms of the other in classical modal logic:

-   □_p_ (necessarily _p_) is equivalent to ¬◇¬_p_ ("not possible that not-_p_")
-   ◇_p_ (possibly _p_) is equivalent to ¬□¬_p_ ("not necessarily not-_p_")

Hence □ and ◇ form a [dual pair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(mathematics)#Duality_in_logic_and_set_theory "Duality (mathematics)") of operators.

In many modal logics, the necessity and possibility operators satisfy the following analogues of [de Morgan's laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws "De Morgan's laws") from [Boolean algebra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(logic) "Boolean algebra (logic)"):

"It is **not necessary that** _X_" is [logically equivalent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_equivalence "Logical equivalence") to "It is **possible that not** _X_".

"It is **not possible that** _X_" is logically equivalent to "It is **necessary that not** _X_".

Precisely what axioms and rules must be added to the [propositional calculus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus "Propositional calculus") to create a usable system of modal logic is a matter of philosophical opinion, often driven by the theorems one wishes to prove; or, in computer science, it is a matter of what sort of computational or deductive system one wishes to model. Many modal logics, known collectively as [normal modal logics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_modal_logic "Normal modal logic"), include the following rule and axiom:

-   **N**, **Necessitation Rule**: If _p_ is a [theorem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem "Theorem")/[tautology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic) "Tautology (logic)") (of any system/model invoking **N**), then □_p_ is likewise a theorem (i.e.  ).
-   **K**, **Distribution Axiom**: □(_p_ → _q_) → (□_p_ → □_q_).

The weakest [normal modal logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_modal_logic "Normal modal logic"), named "_K_" in honor of [Saul Kripke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke "Saul Kripke"), is simply the [propositional calculus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus "Propositional calculus") augmented by □, the rule **N**, and the axiom **K**. _K_ is weak in that it fails to determine whether a proposition can be necessary but only contingently necessary. That is, it is not a theorem of _K_ that if □_p_ is true then □□_p_ is true, i.e., that necessary truths are "necessarily necessary". If such perplexities are deemed forced and artificial, this defect of _K_ is not a great one. In any case, different answers to such questions yield different systems of modal logic.

Adding axioms to _K_ gives rise to other well-known modal systems. One cannot prove in _K_ that if "_p_ is necessary" then _p_ is true. The axiom **T** remedies this defect:

-   **T**, **Reflexivity Axiom**: □_p_ → _p_ (If _p_ is necessary, then _p_ is the case.)

**T** holds in most but not all modal logics. Zeman (1973) describes a few exceptions, such as _S1<sup>0</sup>_.

Other well-known elementary axioms are:

-   **4**:  
-   **B**:  
-   **D**:  
-   **5**:  

These yield the systems (axioms in bold, systems in italics):

-   _K_ := **K** + **N**
-   _T_ := _K_ + **T**
-   _S4_ := _T_ + **4**
-   _S5_ := _T_ + **5**
-   _D_ := _K_ + **D**.

_K_ through _S5_ form a nested hierarchy of systems, making up the core of [normal modal logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_modal_logic "Normal modal logic"). But specific rules or sets of rules may be appropriate for specific systems. For example, in [deontic logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_logic "Deontic logic"),   (If it ought to be that _p_, then it is permitted that _p_) seems appropriate, but we should probably not include that  . In fact, to do so is to commit the [naturalistic fallacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy "Naturalistic fallacy") (i.e. to state that what is natural is also good, by saying that if _p_ is the case, _p_ ought to be permitted).

The commonly employed system _S5_ simply makes all modal truths necessary. For example, if _p_ is possible, then it is "necessary" that _p_ is possible. Also, if _p_ is necessary, then it is necessary that _p_ is necessary. Other systems of modal logic have been formulated, in part because _S5_ does not describe every kind of modality of interest.

### Structural proof theory [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Structural proof theory")

[Sequent calculi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus "Sequent calculus") and systems of natural deduction have been developed for several modal logics, but it has proven hard to combine generality with other features expected of good [structural proof theories](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_proof_theories "Structural proof theories"), such as purity (the proof theory does not introduce extra-logical notions such as labels) and analyticity (the logical rules support a clean notion of [analytic proof](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_proof "Analytic proof")). More complex calculi have been applied to modal logic to achieve generality.

### Decision methods [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Decision methods")

[Analytic tableaux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_tableaux "Analytic tableaux") provide the most popular decision method for modal logics.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGirle2014_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGirle2014-6">[6]</a></sup>

## Modal logics in philosophy [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Modal logics in philosophy")

### Alethic logic [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Alethic logic")

Modalities of necessity and possibility are called _alethic_ modalities. They are also sometimes called _special_ modalities, from the [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") _species_. Modal logic was first developed to deal with these concepts, and only afterward was extended to others. For this reason, or perhaps for their familiarity and simplicity, necessity and possibility are often casually treated as _the_ subject matter of modal logic. Moreover, it is easier to make sense of relativizing necessity, e.g. to legal, physical, [nomological](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomological "Nomological"), [epistemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic "Epistemic"), and so on, than it is to make sense of relativizing other notions.

In [classical modal logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_modal_logic "Classical modal logic"), a proposition is said to be

-   **possible** if it is _not necessarily false_ (regardless of whether it is actually true or actually false);
-   **necessary** if it is _not possibly false_ (i.e. true and necessarily true);
-   **contingent** if it is _not necessarily false_ and _not necessarily true_ (i.e. possible but not necessarily true);
-   **impossible** if it is _not possibly true_ (i.e. false and necessarily false).

In classical modal logic, therefore, the notion of either possibility or necessity may be taken to be basic, where these other notions are defined in terms of it in the manner of [De Morgan duality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan_duality "De Morgan duality"). [Intuitionistic modal logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intuitionistic_modal_logic&action=edit&redlink=1 "Intuitionistic modal logic (page does not exist)") treats possibility and necessity as not perfectly symmetric.

For example, suppose that while walking to the convenience store we pass Friedrich's house, and observe that the lights are off. On the way back, we observe that they have been turned on.

-   "Somebody or something turned the lights on" is _necessary_.
-   "Friedrich turned the lights on", "Friedrich's roommate Max turned the lights on" and "A burglar named Adolf broke into Friedrich's house and turned the lights on" are _contingent_.
-   All of the above statements are _possible_.
-   It is _impossible_ that [Socrates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates "Socrates") (who has been dead for over two thousand years) turned the lights on.

(Of course, this analogy does not apply alethic modality in a _truly_ rigorous fashion; for it to do so, it would have to axiomatically make such statements as "human beings cannot rise from the dead", "Socrates was a human being and not an immortal vampire", and "we did not take hallucinogenic drugs which caused us to falsely believe the lights were on", _ad infinitum_. Absolute certainty of truth or falsehood exists only in the sense of logically constructed abstract concepts such as "it is impossible to draw a triangle with four sides" and "all bachelors are unmarried".)

For those having difficulty with the concept of something being possible but not true, the meaning of these terms may be made more comprehensible by thinking of multiple "possible worlds" (in the sense of [Leibniz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz")) or "alternate universes"; something "necessary" is true in all possible worlds, something "possible" is true in at least one possible world. These "possible world semantics" are formalized with [Kripke semantics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_semantics "Kripke semantics").

#### Physical possibility [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Physical possibility")

Something is physically, or nomically, possible if it is permitted by the [laws of physics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_law "Physical law").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> For example, current theory is thought to allow for there to be an [atom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") with an [atomic number](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number "Atomic number") of 126,<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> even if there are no such atoms in existence. In contrast, while it is logically possible to accelerate beyond the [speed of light](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"),<sup id="cite_ref-Feinberg67_8-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-Feinberg67-8">[8]</a></sup> modern science stipulates that it is not physically possible for material particles or information.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

#### Metaphysical possibility [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Metaphysical possibility")

[Philosophers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophers "Philosophers")<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch"><span title="The material near this tag possibly uses too-vague attribution or weasel words. (April 2012)">who?</span></a></i>]</sup> debate if objects have properties independent of those dictated by scientific laws. For example, it might be metaphysically necessary, as some who advocate [physicalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism "Physicalism") have thought, that all thinking beings have bodies<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> and can experience the passage of [time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time"). [Saul Kripke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke "Saul Kripke") has argued that every person necessarily has the parents they do have: anyone with different parents would not be the same person.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

[Metaphysical possibility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical_possibility "Metaphysical possibility") has been thought to be more restricting than bare logical possibility<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> (i.e., fewer things are metaphysically possible than are logically possible). However, its exact relation (if any) to logical possibility or to physical possibility is a matter of dispute. Philosophers<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch"><span title="The material near this tag possibly uses too-vague attribution or weasel words. (April 2012)">who?</span></a></i>]</sup> also disagree over whether metaphysical truths are necessary merely "by definition", or whether they reflect some underlying deep facts about the world, or something else entirely.

### Epistemic logic [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Epistemic logic")

**Epistemic modalities** (from the Greek _episteme_, knowledge), deal with the _certainty_ of sentences. The □ operator is translated as "x is certain that…", and the ◇ operator is translated as "For all x knows, it may be true that…" In ordinary speech both metaphysical and epistemic modalities are often expressed in similar words; the following contrasts may help:

A person, Jones, might reasonably say _both_: (1) "No, it is _not_ possible that [Bigfoot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot "Bigfoot") exists; I am quite certain of that"; _and_, (2) "Sure, it's _possible_ that Bigfoots could exist". What Jones means by (1) is that, given all the available information, there is no question remaining as to whether Bigfoot exists. This is an epistemic claim. By (2) he makes the _metaphysical_ claim that it is _possible for_ Bigfoot to exist, _even though he does not_: there is no physical or biological reason that large, featherless, bipedal creatures with thick hair could not exist in the forests of North America (regardless of whether or not they do). Similarly, "it is possible for the person reading this sentence to be fourteen feet tall and named Chad" is _metaphysically_ true (such a person would not somehow be prevented from doing so on account of their height and name), but not _alethically_ true unless you match that description, and not _epistemically_ true if it's known that fourteen-foot-tall human beings have never existed.

From the other direction, Jones might say, (3) "It is _possible_ that [Goldbach's conjecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture "Goldbach's conjecture") is true; but also _possible_ that it is false", and _also_ (4) "if it _is_ true, then it is necessarily true, and not possibly false". Here Jones means that it is _epistemically possible_ that it is true or false, for all he knows (Goldbach's conjecture has not been proven either true or false), but if there _is_ a proof (heretofore undiscovered), then it would show that it is not _logically_ possible for Goldbach's conjecture to be false—there could be no set of numbers that violated it. Logical possibility is a form of _alethic_ possibility; (4) makes a claim about whether it is possible (i.e., logically speaking) that a mathematical truth to have been false, but (3) only makes a claim about whether it is possible, for all Jones knows, (i.e., speaking of certitude) that the mathematical claim is specifically either true or false, and so again Jones does not contradict himself. It is worthwhile to observe that Jones is not necessarily correct: It is possible (epistemically) that [Goldbach's conjecture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture#History "Goldbach's conjecture") is both true and unprovable.

Epistemic possibilities also bear on the actual world in a way that metaphysical possibilities do not. Metaphysical possibilities bear on ways the world _might have been,_ but epistemic possibilities bear on the way the world _may be_ (for all we know). Suppose, for example, that I want to know whether or not to take an umbrella before I leave. If you tell me "it is _possible that_ it is raining outside" – in the sense of epistemic possibility – then that would weigh on whether or not I take the umbrella. But if you just tell me that "it is _possible for_ it to rain outside" – in the sense of _metaphysical possibility_ – then I am no better off for this bit of modal enlightenment.

Some features of epistemic modal logic are in debate. For example, if _x_ knows that _p_, does _x_ know that it knows that _p_? That is to say, should □_P_ → □□_P_ be an axiom in these systems? While the answer to this question is unclear,<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> there is at least one axiom that is generally included in epistemic modal logic, because it is minimally true of all normal modal logics (see [the section on axiomatic systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#Axiomatic_systems)):

-   **K**, _Distribution Axiom_:  .

It has been questioned whether the epistemic and alethic modalities should be considered distinct from each other. The criticism states that there is no real difference between "the truth in the world" (alethic) and "the truth in an individual's mind" (epistemic).<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> An investigation has not found a single language in which alethic and epistemic modalities are formally distinguished, as by the means of a [grammatical mood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood "Grammatical mood").<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

### Temporal logic [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Temporal logic")

Temporal logic is an approach to the semantics of expressions with [tense](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense "Grammatical tense"), that is, expressions with qualifications of when. Some expressions, such as '2 + 2 = 4', are true at all times, while tensed expressions such as 'John is happy' are only true sometimes.

In temporal logic, tense constructions are treated in terms of modalities, where a standard method for formalizing talk of time is to use _two_ pairs of operators, one for the past and one for the future (P will just mean 'it is presently the case that P'). For example:

**F**_P_ : It will sometimes be the case that _P_

**G**_P_ : It will always be the case that _P_

**P**_P_ : It was sometime the case that _P_

**H**_P_ : It has always been the case that _P_

There are then at least three modal logics that we can develop. For example, we can stipulate that,

  = _P_ is the case at some time _t_

  = _P_ is the case at every time _t_

Or we can trade these operators to deal only with the future (or past). For example,

  = **F**_P_

  = **G**_P_

or,

  = _P_ and/or **F**_P_

  = _P_ and **G**_P_

The operators **F** and **G** may seem initially foreign, but they create [normal modal systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_modal_logic "Normal modal logic"). **F**_P_ is the same as ¬**G**¬_P_. We can combine the above operators to form complex statements. For example, **P**_P_ → □**P**_P_ says (effectively), _Everything that is past and true is necessary_.

It seems reasonable to say that possibly it will rain tomorrow, and possibly it will not; on the other hand, since we cannot change the past, if it is true that it rained yesterday, it cannot be true that it may not have rained yesterday. It seems the past is "fixed", or necessary, in a way the future is not. This is sometimes referred to as [accidental necessity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_necessity "Accidental necessity"). But if the past is "fixed", and everything that is in the future will eventually be in the past, then it seems plausible to say that future events are necessary too.

Similarly, the [problem of future contingents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_future_contingents "Problem of future contingents") considers the semantics of assertions about the future: is either of the propositions 'There will be a sea battle tomorrow', or 'There will not be a sea battle tomorrow' now true? Considering this thesis led [Aristotle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") to reject the [principle of bivalence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence "Principle of bivalence") for assertions concerning the future.

Additional binary operators are also relevant to temporal logics (see [Linear temporal logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic "Linear temporal logic")).

Versions of temporal logic can be used in [computer science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") to model computer operations and prove theorems about them. In one version, ◇_P_ means "at a future time in the computation it is possible that the computer state will be such that P is true"; □_P_ means "at all future times in the computation P will be true". In another version, ◇_P_ means "at the immediate next state of the computation, _P_ might be true"; □_P_ means "at the immediate next state of the computation, P will be true". These differ in the choice of [Accessibility relation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility_relation "Accessibility relation"). (P always means "P is true at the current computer state".) These two examples involve nondeterministic or not-fully-understood computations; there are many other modal logics specialized to different types of program analysis. Each one naturally leads to slightly different axioms.

### Deontic logic [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Deontic logic")

Likewise talk of morality, or of [obligation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obligation "Obligation") and [norms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(philosophy) "Norm (philosophy)") generally, seems to have a modal structure. The difference between "You must do this" and "You may do this" looks a lot like the difference between "This is necessary" and "This is possible". Such logics are called _[deontic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_logic "Deontic logic")_, from the Greek for "duty".

Deontic logics commonly lack the axiom **T** semantically corresponding to the reflexivity of the accessibility relation in [Kripke semantics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_semantics "Kripke semantics"): in symbols,  . Interpreting □ as "it is obligatory that", **T** informally says that every obligation is true. For example, if it is obligatory not to kill others (i.e. killing is morally forbidden), then **T** implies that people actually do not kill others. The consequent is obviously false.

Instead, using [Kripke semantics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_semantics "Kripke semantics"), we say that though our own world does not realize all obligations, the worlds accessible to it do (i.e., **T** holds at these worlds). These worlds are called _idealized_ worlds. _P_ is obligatory with respect to our own world if at all idealized worlds accessible to our world, _P_ holds. Though this was one of the first interpretations of the formal semantics, it has recently come under criticism.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

One other principle that is often (at least traditionally) accepted as a deontic principle is _D_,  , which corresponds to the seriality (or extendability or unboundedness) of the accessibility relation. It is an embodiment of the Kantian idea that "ought implies can". (Clearly the "can" can be interpreted in various senses, e.g. in a moral or alethic sense.)

#### Intuitive problems with deontic logic [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Intuitive problems with deontic logic")

When we try to formalize ethics with standard modal logic, we run into some problems. Suppose that we have a proposition _K_: you have stolen some money, and another, _Q_: you have stolen a small amount of money. Now suppose we want to express the thought that "if you have stolen some money, it ought to be a small amount of money". There are two likely candidates,

(1)  

(2)  

But (1) and _K_ together entail □_Q_, which says that it ought to be the case that you have stolen a small amount of money. This surely is not right, because you ought not to have stolen anything at all. And (2) does not work either: If the right representation of "if you have stolen some money it ought to be a small amount" is (2), then the right representation of (3) "if you have stolen some money then it ought to be a large amount" is  . Now suppose (as seems reasonable) that you ought not to steal anything, or  . But then we can deduce   via   and   (the [contrapositive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrapositive "Contrapositive") of  ); so sentence (3) follows from our hypothesis (of course the same logic shows sentence (2)). But that cannot be right, and is not right when we use natural language. Telling someone they should not steal certainly does not imply that they should steal large amounts of money if they do engage in theft.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

### Doxastic logic [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Doxastic logic")

_Doxastic logic_ concerns the logic of belief (of some set of agents). The term doxastic is derived from the [ancient Greek](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") _doxa_ which means "belief". Typically, a doxastic logic uses □, often written "B", to mean "It is believed that", or when relativized to a particular agent s, "It is believed by s that".

## Metaphysical questions [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Metaphysical questions")

In the most common interpretation of modal logic, one considers "[logically possible](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logically_possible "Logically possible") worlds". If a statement is true in all [possible worlds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_worlds "Possible worlds"), then it is a necessary truth. If a statement happens to be true in our world, but is not true in all possible worlds, then it is a contingent truth. A statement that is true in some possible world (not necessarily our own) is called a possible truth.

Under this "possible worlds idiom", to maintain that Bigfoot's existence is possible but not actual, one says, "There is some possible world in which Bigfoot exists; but in the actual world, Bigfoot does not exist". However, it is unclear what this claim commits us to. Are we really alleging the existence of possible worlds, every bit as real as our actual world, just not actual? [Saul Kripke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke "Saul Kripke") believes that 'possible world' is something of a misnomer – that the term 'possible world' is just a useful way of visualizing the concept of possibility.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> For him, the sentences "you could have rolled a 4 instead of a 6" and "there is a possible world where you rolled a 4, but you rolled a 6 in the actual world" are not significantly different statements, and neither commit us to the existence of a possible world.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> [David Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lewis_(philosopher) "David Lewis (philosopher)"), on the other hand, made himself notorious by biting the bullet, asserting that all merely possible worlds are as real as our own, and that what distinguishes our world as _actual_ is simply that it is indeed our world – _[this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexicality "Indexicality")_ world.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> That position is a major tenet of "[modal realism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_realism "Modal realism")". Some philosophers decline to endorse any version of modal realism, considering it ontologically extravagant, and prefer to seek various ways to paraphrase away these ontological commitments. [Robert Adams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Merrihew_Adams "Robert Merrihew Adams") holds that 'possible worlds' are better thought of as 'world-stories', or consistent sets of propositions. Thus, it is possible that you rolled a 4 if such a state of affairs can be described coherently.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

Computer scientists will generally pick a highly specific interpretation of the modal operators specialized to the particular sort of computation being analysed. In place of "all worlds", you may have "all possible next states of the computer", or "all possible future states of the computer".

## Further applications [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Further applications")

Modal logics have begun to be used in areas of the humanities such as literature, poetry, art and history.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> In the [philosophy of religion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_religion "Philosophy of religion"), modal logics are commonly used in arguments for the [existence of God](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_of_God "Existence of God").<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

## History [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modal_logic&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: History")

The basic ideas of modal logic date back to antiquity. [Aristotle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") developed a modal syllogistic in Book I of his _[Prior Analytics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_Analytics "Prior Analytics")_ (ch. 8–22), which [Theophrastus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophrastus "Theophrastus") attempted to improve.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> There are also passages in Aristotle's work, such as the famous [sea-battle argument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_future_contingents "Problem of future contingents") in _[De Interpretatione](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Interpretatione "De Interpretatione")_ §9, that are now seen as anticipations of the connection of modal logic with [potentiality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality "Potentiality") and time. In the Hellenistic period, the logicians [Diodorus Cronus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diodorus_Cronus "Diodorus Cronus"), [Philo the Dialectician](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_the_Dialectician "Philo the Dialectician") and the Stoic [Chrysippus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus "Chrysippus") each developed a modal system that accounted for the interdefinability of possibility and necessity, accepted [axiom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom "Axiom") **T** (see [below](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#Axiomatic_systems)), and combined elements of modal logic and [temporal logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic "Temporal logic") in attempts to solve the notorious [Master Argument](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diodorus_Cronus#Master_Argument "Diodorus Cronus").<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> The earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by [Avicenna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna "Avicenna"), who ultimately developed a theory of "[temporally](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic "Temporal logic") modal" syllogistic.<sup id="cite_ref-Britannica_27-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-Britannica-27">[27]</a></sup> Modal logic as a self-aware subject owes much to the writings of the [Scholastics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholastics "Scholastics"), in particular [William of Ockham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham "William of Ockham") and [John Duns Scotus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Duns_Scotus "John Duns Scotus"), who reasoned informally in a modal manner, mainly to analyze statements about [essence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence "Essence") and [accident](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_(philosophy) "Accident (philosophy)").

In the 19th century, [Hugh MacColl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_MacColl "Hugh MacColl") made innovative contributions to modal logic, but did not find much acknowledgment.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> [C. I. Lewis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._I._Lewis "C. I. Lewis") founded modern modal logic in a series of scholarly articles beginning in 1912 with "Implication and the Algebra of Logic".<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> Lewis was led to invent modal logic, and specifically [strict implication](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_implication "Strict implication"), on the grounds that classical logic grants [paradoxes of material implication](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxes_of_material_implication "Paradoxes of material implication") such as the principle that [a falsehood implies any proposition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth "Vacuous truth").<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> This work culminated in his 1932 book _Symbolic Logic_ (with [C. H. Langford](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Harold_Langford "Cooper Harold Langford")),<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> which introduced the five systems _S1_ through _S5_.

After Lewis, modal logic received little attention for several decades. [Nicholas Rescher](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Rescher "Nicholas Rescher") has argued that this was because [Bertrand Russell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell "Bertrand Russell") rejected it.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> However, [Jan Dejnozka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jan_Dejnozka&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jan Dejnozka (page does not exist)") has argued against this view, stating that a modal system which Dejnozka calls "MDL" is described in Russell's works, although Russell did believe the concept of modality to "come from confusing propositions with [propositional functions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_function "Propositional function")", as he wrote in _The Analysis of Matter_.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

Ruth C. Barcan (later [Ruth Barcan Marcus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Barcan_Marcus "Ruth Barcan Marcus")) developed the first axiomatic systems of quantified modal logic — first and second order extensions of Lewis' _S2_, _S4_, and _S5_.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> [Arthur Norman Prior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Norman_Prior "Arthur Norman Prior") warned her to prepare well in the debates concerning quantified modal logic with [Willard Van Orman Quine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine "Willard Van Orman Quine"), because of bias against modal logic.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

The contemporary era in modal semantics began in 1959, when [Saul Kripke](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke "Saul Kripke") (then only a 18-year-old [Harvard University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") undergraduate) introduced the now-standard [Kripke semantics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_semantics "Kripke semantics") for modal logics. These are commonly referred to as "possible worlds" semantics. Kripke and [A. N. Prior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._N._Prior "A. N. Prior") had previously corresponded at some length. Kripke semantics is basically simple, but proofs are eased using semantic-tableaux or [analytic tableaux](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_tableaux "Analytic tableaux"), as explained by [E. W. Beth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evert_Willem_Beth "Evert Willem Beth").

[A. N. Prior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._N._Prior "A. N. Prior") created modern [temporal logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic "Temporal logic"), closely related to modal logic, in 1957 by adding modal operators \[F\] and \[P\] meaning "eventually" and "previously". [Vaughan Pratt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Pratt "Vaughan Pratt") introduced [dynamic logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_logic_(modal_logic) "Dynamic logic (modal logic)") in 1976. In 1977, [Amir Pnueli](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir_Pnueli "Amir Pnueli") proposed using temporal logic to formalise the behaviour of continually operating [concurrent programs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_program "Concurrent program"). Flavors of temporal logic include [propositional dynamic logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_dynamic_logic "Propositional dynamic logic") (PDL), (propositional) [linear temporal logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic "Linear temporal logic") (LTL), [computation tree logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_tree_logic "Computation tree logic") (CTL), [Hennessy–Milner logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennessy%E2%80%93Milner_logic "Hennessy–Milner logic"), and _T_.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="Add a wikilink, give a longer name, or give a reference for the 'T' logic. (November 2016)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The mathematical structure of modal logic, namely [Boolean algebras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(structure) "Boolean algebra (structure)") augmented with [unary operations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation "Unary operation") (often called [modal algebras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_algebra "Modal algebra")), began to emerge with [J. C. C. McKinsey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.C.C._McKinsey "J.C.C. McKinsey")'s 1941 proof that _S2_ and _S4_ are decidable,<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> and reached full flower in the work of [Alfred Tarski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski "Alfred Tarski") and his student [Bjarni Jónsson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarni_J%C3%B3nsson "Bjarni Jónsson") (Jónsson and Tarski 1951–52). This work revealed that _S4_ and _S5_ are models of [interior algebra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_algebra "Interior algebra"), a proper extension of Boolean algebra originally designed to capture the properties of the [interior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_operator "Interior operator") and [closure operators](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_operator "Closure operator") of [topology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"). Texts on modal logic typically do little more than mention its connections with the study of [Boolean algebras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(structure) "Boolean algebra (structure)") and [topology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"). For a thorough survey of the history of formal modal logic and of the associated mathematics, see [Robert Goldblatt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Goldblatt "Robert Goldblatt") (2006).<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>
