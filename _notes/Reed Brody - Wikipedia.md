## Early life and education\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reed_Brody&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and education")\]

Brody was born in [Brooklyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn "Brooklyn"), [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"), on July 20, [1953](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953 "1953"). His father, Ervin Brody, a Hungarian Jew, who was a major influence in his life,<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> survived forced labor in German camps during World War II, eventually escaping to join the Soviet Red Army and participate in the liberation of Budapest before emigrating to the United States and teaching at [Fairleigh Dickinson University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairleigh_Dickinson_University "Fairleigh Dickinson University"). His mother, Francesca Cash, was an artist and an arts teacher at a Brooklyn inner-city school.

Brody received his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Fairleigh Dickinson University where he was Student Government President and a leader in the anti-Vietnam War movement. He earned his [J.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor "Juris Doctor") degree from [Columbia University School of Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University_School_of_Law "Columbia University School of Law"). While a law student, Brody worked a year in Paris as a teaching assistant at the [Université de Paris (Panthéon-Sorbonne)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_de_Paris_I "Université de Paris I"). Brody holds an honorary doctorate from Fairleigh Dickinson University and was awarded a Public Interest Achievement Award by Columbia University Law School.

## Career\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reed_Brody&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Career")\]

After law school, Brody was the New York State Assistant Attorney General from 1980 to 1984 where he authored [consumer protection laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection "Consumer protection") and advocated on behalf of consumers and workers in [class action-type suits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action "Class action") against large corporations and financial institutions. He was called "the leading expert in the country on career-counseling malpractices.”<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

Brody left his position as Assistant Attorney General to research and uncover a pattern of atrocities against Nicaraguan civilians by US-funded "[contras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras "Contras")". His report, _Contra Terror in Nicaragua_,<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> received national front-page coverage<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> and led to U.S. Congressional hearings and a temporary halt to contra funding. Brody conducted a speaking tour of over 60 U.S. cities and appeared as co-counsel with the [Center for Constitutional Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Constitutional_Rights "Center for Constitutional Rights") in litigation in U.S. federal court to stop U.S. aid to contras. His report was also introduced into evidence in the case _[Nicaragua v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States "Nicaragua v. United States")_ at the [International Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice "International Court of Justice") in The Hague. He was criticized by United States President [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan"), who described him as a Sandinista "sympathizer".<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

From 1987 until 1992, Brody worked for the [International Commission of Jurists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_of_Jurists "International Commission of Jurists") in Geneva, as the Director of its Centre for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers (CIJL),<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> where he organized campaigns on behalf of harassed and detained jurists and engaged in high-level regional and national seminars on the independence of numerous judiciary systems around the world. He helped draft the UN Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers which were adopted in 1991 and the same year was one of the advocates for the creation of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Together with [P. N. Bhagwati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._N._Bhagwati "P. N. Bhagwati"), former Chief Justice of India, he assisted the government of [Mongolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia "Mongolia") on behalf of the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") in preparing its 1991 constitution.

In 1992, Brody became Executive Director of the International Human Rights Law Group (which became [Global Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Rights "Global Rights")), where he served until 1994 placing activists in-country to train and empower locally based rights advocates in a dozen countries. In 1993, he was spokesman for the more than 3,000 NGO representatives at the UN World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Brody then served as Director of the Human Rights Division of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador ([ONUSAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONUSAL "ONUSAL")) from 1994 until 1995, where he led a staff of human rights officers and police observers responsible for verifying respect for human rights, monitoring compliance with peace accords, and coordinating international support to [El Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador "El Salvador")’s judiciary and Human Rights Ombudsman.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> He was also a member of the UN Preliminary Mission to establish a human rights verification mission in [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala "Guatemala") ([MINUGUA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINUGUA "MINUGUA")) in 1994.

In 1995, Brody helped found the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux in [Haiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti "Haiti") to prosecute human rights crimes committed during de facto military rule. The investigations he began led to the convictions of 57 military and paramilitary officers for the "[Raboteau Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raboteau_Massacre "Raboteau Massacre")," the most significant rights prosecution in Haitian history.

Brody served as media liaison for the exiled [Tibetan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet "Tibet") Women's Delegation at the 1995 UN Women’s Conference in Beijing whose harassment by the Chinese authorities became one of the symbols of the conference.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> In 1995, he was expelled from occupied [East Timor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor "East Timor") by Indonesian authorities.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> He led an [Amnesty International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International "Amnesty International") fact-finding mission to [Sierra Leone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone "Sierra Leone") (1996). As former Executive Secretary, he was a coordinator of the [International Commission of Jurists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_of_Jurists "International Commission of Jurists")' report _Tibet: Human Rights and the Rule of Law_, published in 1997.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> He was a member of the U.S. National Criminal Justice Commission, which produced _The Real War on Crime_, published in 1996.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

In 1997, Brody was Deputy Director of the United Nations Secretary General’s Investigative Team in the [Democratic Republic of the Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo "Democratic Republic of the Congo"), charged with probing atrocities committed by troops loyal to [Laurent Kabila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Kabila "Laurent Kabila").<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

## Human Rights Watch\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reed_Brody&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Human Rights Watch")\]

Brody was with [Human Rights Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch "Human Rights Watch") from 1998 to 2016 and was an integral part of the organization’s efforts to hold perpetrators of large-scale human rights violations accountable for their crimes. Most notably, Brody directed Human Rights Watch’s participation in the landmark case of former Chilean dictator [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet "Augusto Pinochet") before the [British House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_House_of_Lords "British House of Lords"). Brody called the Lords’ decision in the [Pinochet case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinochet_case "Pinochet case") – that the Chilean did not enjoy immunity and could be prosecuted on the basis of universal jurisdiction despite his status as a former head of state – a "wake-up call" to tyrants and a “spark of hope for victims.”<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> In the wake of the Pinochet case, Brody began working with victims to pursue other former exiled leaders including Hissène Habré of Chad, [Mengistu Haile Mariam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengistu_Haile_Mariam "Mengistu Haile Mariam") of Ethiopia, [Jean-Claude Duvalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Duvalier "Jean-Claude Duvalier") and [Raul Cédras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_C%C3%A9dras "Raoul Cédras") of Haiti, and [Idi Amin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idi_Amin "Idi Amin") of Uganda. He wrote the Human Rights Watch booklet _The Pinochet Precedent: How Victims can Pursue Human Rights Criminals Abroad_.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Brody also participated in the 1998 Rome Conference which led the creation of the International Criminal Court.

Brody was an observer at the 2012 trial of Spanish judge [Baltasar Garzón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltasar_Garz%C3%B3n "Baltasar Garzón") for refusing to apply Spain’s amnesty law and proceeding with an investigation into atrocities committed under Francisco Franco and during Spain’s civil war. Judge Garzón is best known for using the doctrine of [universal jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_jurisdiction "Universal jurisdiction") to investigate [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes "War crimes") and [torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture "Torture") across national lines, most notably ordering the arrest of Chilean dictator [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet "Augusto Pinochet") and seeking to indict members of the Bush administration for their role in torturing prisoners. Although Garzón was acquitted in the Franco-era trial, on 9 February 2012, the [Supreme Court of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Spain "Supreme Court of Spain") convicted Judge Garzón of illegally wiretapping conversations to discover evidence of illicit money laundering tactics being used by suspects and their lawyers.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

In April 2010, Brody spoke at a rally of over 60,000 in Madrid’s [Puerta del Sol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerta_del_Sol "Puerta del Sol"), noting the irony that Judge Garzón was prosecuted for attempting to apply the very principles that he had successfully promoted internationally.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Brody expressed indignation that Judge Garzón was the first judge in Spain to be put on trial for ordering wiretaps.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

In 2010, he assisted the Haitian government in building the case against former dictator Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier, and he co-authored the HRW report _Haiti’s Rendezvous with History: The Case of Jean-Claude Duvalier_.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> He is featured in a video on the case produced by Human Rights Watch.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

Brody attended legal proceedings at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay Cuba in 2010. He is author of the July 2011 HRW report _Getting Away with Torture_<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> which examined the impunity of former US President [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush "George W. Bush") and other top officials for the widespread mistreatment of Muslim prisoners, and of the book _Faut-il Juger George Bush?_ based on the report. His other HRW reports on [counter-terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-terrorism "Counter-terrorism") issues include _The Road to Abu Ghraib_ (June 2004),<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> which investigated the roots of the [prisoner abuse scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse "Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse") and _The United States’ 'Disappeared'_ (October 2004),<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> which looked at the long-term incommunicado detention of [al-Qaeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda "Al-Qaeda") leaders in "secret locations".

## Hissène Habré case\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reed_Brody&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Hissène Habré case")\]

Since 1999, Brody has worked with the victims of Hissène Habré, the former dictator of Chad, to bring him and his accomplices to justice. Habré is convicted of thousands of political killings and systematic torture when he ruled Chad from 1982 to 1990 before fleeing into exile in Senegal.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

Habré was first indicted by a Senegalese judge in 2000, and in 2001 Brody and his colleague Olivier Bercault uncovered the files of Habré’s political police in an abandoned building in Chad,<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> which revealed the names of 1,208 people who were killed or died in detention, and 12,321 victims of arbitrary detention and other abuses. But for the next 12 years, the Senegalese government of President Abdoulaye Wade subjected the victims to what the Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu described as an “interminable political and legal soap opera”<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> which forced the victims to seek justice in Belgium, and would involve the United Nations Committee against Torture, the Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union and the International Court of Justice. After what the Toronto Globe and Mail called “one of the world’s most patient and tenacious campaigns for justice"<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> waged by the victims with Brody’s support, Habré’s trial by a special African Union-backed court in Senegal finally began on July 20, 2015 and ended on February 11, 2016. On May 30, 2016, the court convicted<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Habré for crimes against humanity, including torture, rape and sexual slavery, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. It was the first time ever that a former head of state had been prosecuted for human rights crimes in the courts of another country. The New York Times, among others, hailed the case as “a Milestone for justice in Africa.” On April 27, 2017, an appeals court confirmed the verdict and ordered Habré to pay approximately US$130 million in victim compensation. It mandated an African Union trust fund to raise the money by searching for Habré’s assets and soliciting contributions.

Also as a result of the victims’ campaign, on March 25, 2015, a Chadian criminal court convicted 20 Habré-era security agents on charges of murder, torture, kidnapping and arbitrary detention.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> The court also awarded 75 billion CFA francs (US$119 million) in reparations to 7,000 victims, ordering the government to pay half and the convicted agents the other half.

Since the verdicts, Brody has continued to work with the victims for implementation of the courts’ reparation decisions. In September 2022, Chad’s presidency announcing that the government had allocated 10 billion CFA francs ($16.5 million) for the AU Trust Fund. According to the AU, however, that money has not been received. On May 2, 2023, Chad’s transitional president, Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno, told a delegation from the victims’ association that he had asked the finance minister to make Chad’s contribution available to the victims.

In November 2022, Brody wrote about the case in “To Catch a Dictator: The Pursuit and Trial of Hissène Habré.”<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> The Washington Post called the book “An absorbing saga that raises a disturbing question: How do brutal fascists like Habré and other murderous heads of state evade a courtroom reckoning for so long after falling from power?”<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

## Post-HRW\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reed_Brody&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Post-HRW")\]

Brody is active in human rights causes in the United States. In October 2016, he represented the journalist Amy Goodman, host of the television and radio show Democracy Now!, who was charged with criminal offenses for her reporting on an attack against Native American-led anti-pipeline protesters at Standing Rock, North Dakota. The charges were dropped<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

In January 2017, Brody was elected to the International Commission of Jurists. He is also on the Boards of Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), the Rose Lokissim Association and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights.

In 2017, he began working with victims of the former dictator of Gambia [Yahya Jammeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Jammeh "Yahya Jammeh") who is now in exile in Equatorial Guinea. Brody organized a meeting between the victims of Hissène Habré and the victims of Yahya Jammeh<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> and helped launch the “Campaign to Bring Yahya Jammeh and his Accomplices to Justice”- (“#Jammeh2Justice").<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> In May 2018, he spearheaded an investigation which revealed that 56 West African migrants, mostly from Ghana, had been killed by a death squad taking orders from Jammeh.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> His June 2019 investigation uncovered a state-sponsored system in which women were brought to Jammeh who then abused them and reported the cases of three women who accused Jammeh of rape and sexual abuse.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> These investigations fed into the work of Gambia’s landmark Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) which in 2021 recommended that Jammeh and his henchmen be prosecuted.

Brody also worked with the Gambia Bar Association on a series of multi-stakeholder consultations beginning in 2019 to examine how to follow up on any prosecution recommendations by the TRRC. These discussions resulted in a consensus in favor of a “hybrid” court, anchored on a treaty with ECOWAS.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> In 2023, the Gambia government and ECOWAS took on board the proposal and created a joint task force to work towards a hybrid tribunal to prosecute the worst crimes of the Jammeh era.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

He also helped initiate a criminal case in Argentina against [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia")’s visiting Crown Prince [Mohammed bin Salman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_bin_Salman "Mohammed bin Salman").<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Brody#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>

Brody, who currently lives in Barcelona and Carcassonne, is a regular commentator on French and Spanish media on issues of war crimes, international relations and US politics.
