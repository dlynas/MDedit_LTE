## The "Understanding Hegel" reading list?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/pjqg1/the_understanding_hegel_reading_list/](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/pjqg1/the_understanding_hegel_reading_list/)

> So it seems like he's definitely up there on the hardest-to-understand list, and assumes that the reader is well-versed in lots of philosophical works up to that point. Is there any definitive list of stuff I should make sure I read before I try to dive into Hegel?

	>Is there any definitive list of stuff I should make sure I read before I try to dive into Hegel?

	No.  Some familiarity with Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Fichte, and Schelling will go a long way.  If you are also familiar with Descartes, Leibniz, and more "minor" figures in German idealism like Reinhold, Jacobi, Schulze, et al., then that's an even bigger bonus.

	Basically, Hegel knew the history of philosophy that came before him extremely well.  If you want to catch all of Hegel's references and whatnot, you basically need to know the history of philosophy before him.  His main points of reference are usually either the Greeks (especially [Aristotle](http://www.amazon.com/Hegel-Aristotle-Modern-European-Philosophy/dp/0521037751/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328907906&amp;sr=1-1)) or [his contemporaries](http://www.amazon.com/German-Idealism-Struggle-Subjectivism-1781-1801/dp/0674027175/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328907941&amp;sr=1-1), though.

	**That said**, though, Hegel's way of taking up the history of philosophy is pretty idiosyncratic.  His references often conflate distinct philosophical positions in ways that are contentious to say the least.  Major works like the *Phenomenology* and the *Science of Logic* also tend to be pretty spare in the number of proper names to which they refer, which can make spotting sources and references even more difficult.

	The fact of the matter is that Hegel is *extremely* challenging to read, and no amount of preparation will make that go away.  Learning more about the history of philosophy and reading Hegel's texts repeatedly will help to make him a little less baffling, but even Hegel scholars that I know will tell you that Hegel is sometimes inscrutable.

	If you want to start reading and getting a handle on Hegel, I'll give you the same advice that I have given [others who have asked similar questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/lwm7p/is_hegel_something_i_canshould_jump_right_into_or/): start with the *Phenomenology* (because there is **a lot** more secondary literature in English on the *Phenomenology* than there is on any of Hegel's other texts).  I would begin with the "Preface" to the *Phenomenology*.   ([Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/kuls4/hegels_preface_to_the_phenomenology_of_spirit/) is some advice that I gave to someone trying to understand that text; you may or may not find it helpful.)  You will likely find it damn near impossible to figure out the preface your first time through; that's fine and you shouldn't feel bad about it.  The main point of reading it at this point is just to give yourself a sense of what reading Hegel is like.

	I would then recommend that you take a look at Michael Forster's [*Hegel's Idea of a Phenomenology of Spirit*](http://www.amazon.com/Hegels-Phenomenology-Spirit-Michael-Forster/dp/0226257428/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328908347&amp;sr=8-1).  It is an extremely helpful introduction to and broad overview of the aims and concerns of the *Phenomenology*. (Forster identifies 11 distinct 'tasks' that the *Phenomenology* tries to accomplish, which he then divides into metaphysical, epistemological, and pedagogical tasks; his book then traces how the *Phenomenology* goes about accomplishing these tasks.)  Forster offers some commentary on specific chapters, but for the most part his book is focused on the whole rather than paying detailed attention to the parts.

	When you've finished the Forster, begin reading the *Phenomenology* again from the beginning.  Alongside the Hegel, also read Hyppolite's [*Genesis and Structure of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit*](http://www.amazon.com/Genesis-Structure-Hegels-Phenomenology-Spirit/dp/0810105942/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328908581&amp;sr=1-1), which is basically still the standard chapter-by-chapter commentary.  Read one chapter by Hegel first, then read the corresponding chapter in the Hyppolite, then go back and re-read the Hegel.

	Obviously, this is **a lot** of work.  You'll need a good deal of patience and commitment to manage all this.  That said, I think that understanding Hegel is a rewarding process.

	(I've said this to others, but I'll repeat it here: Koj√®ve's *Introduction to the Reading of Hegel*, while rightfully famous, is extremely idiosyncratic in its interpretation of what Hegel is up to in the *Phenomenology*. This is why I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is approaching Hegel for the first time. Once you've read a bit by Hegel himself and a bit by commentators like Hyppolite, then it is interesting to check out the Koj√®ve, which was extremely influential in France in the period following the second World War.)

	\*Edit: corrected typo.  I would also add that others are right to point to Hegel's prefaces and introductions as generally more accessible than the texts they preface or introduce.  That said, and as the preface to the *Phenomenology* indicates, they can still be extremely challenging.

			Those are good suggestions, but so that you are aware of a conflicting viewpoint: I would not recommend starting with the Phenomenology.  It is justly influential and benefits, as was noted, from much secondary literature, but it is also exceedingly difficult, even relative to Hegel's other work.  If you already have some understanding of what Hegel is up to, that foundation will be the ideal preparation for reading the Phenomenology, and the best way to set that foundation is working through Hegel in places where he works in a comparable but more accessible way.

				I think you're absolutely right that the *Phenomenology* is not Hegel's most accessible work.  (I think I might disagree about it being substantially more difficult than, say, the *Logic* or *Encyclopaedia*, but that's an aside.)  From my point of view, though, there basically is no such thing as genuinely accessible Hegel.  Even the stuff that is somewhat easier than the *Phenomenology* is still extremely challenging.  My suggestion to start with the *Phenomenology* really is predicated on the availability of secondary literature, then.  I think that it's really important to be able to turn to secondary literature for help when you're trying to tackle Hegel.

					I find the introduction to the *Philosophy of History* fairly accessible.  The description of historiographic methods concluding in the method of philosophical history is a good introduction to Hegel's notions of dialectic and speculation.  Follow this by the introduction to the *History of Philosophy*, and one gets a better sense of how this method relates not just to history but to the content of reason.  Then read the introduction to the *Encyclopedia Logic* and the framework of this method is made clear, along with the problematic that arises from it.  Then read the introduction to the *Lectures on Fine Art* for a relatively accessible discussion of how this method is applied to a concrete scenario.
					
					At least, this is the introductory course I recommend.
					
					Though as I said, I do think your suggestion is good, and just offer this as an alternative perspective.

						Interesting.  I will admit that I am not a terribly big fan of the lectures on the philosophy of history and on aesthetics, so it has been a while since I took a look at those texts.  I'll have to check them out again.  In general, Hegel's lectures are definitely more accessible than the texts that he composed himself and intended to have published as books, so your advice makes sense.
						
						Either way, it's just interesting to hear a different take than mine.  Thanks!  I suppose I may also be biased because my first approach to Hegel was through the *Phenomenology*, which I beat my head against to no avail for a good year or so before I finally felt like I was starting to crack it.

	Probably the easiest way to understand Hegel in primary source would be to start at the right place.  The first Hegel you should read are **the introductions to** the Lectures on the Philosophy of History, Lectures on the History of Philosophy, Lectures on Aesthetics, and Encyclopedia Logic.  Another good place to start would be some of the early works, especially Faith and Knowledge, and The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate.  These would be the ideal preparation for tackling any of his major works as a whole.

	Some introductions to Hegel via secondary source would probably be helpful.

	If you want to prepare with other primary sources, it would be quite a task.  If anything, read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, then Reinhold's Letters on the Kantian Philosophy.  Other than that, more Kant (especially the other two Critiques) some Fichte (perhaps the Introductions to the Wissenschaftslehre), Schelling (at least some of the System of Transcendental Idealism), and Spinoza (Ethics) would be helpful.

* üü© **[metaphysicalibration](https://www.reddit.com/user/metaphysicalibration)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2012-02-10 15:32:28)_

	*The Phenomenology of Spirit* and *The Science of Logic* are both, in part, Hegel's replies to Kant and Locke; their *The Critique of Pure Reason* and *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding*, respectively and specifically. They would be a good, if dense and difficult, place to start.

	Berkeley wouldn't be a bad choice to look into either, as he comes to the same metaphysical conclusion as Hegel (Absolute Idealism), but by a very different epistemological route. 

	Maybe Heraclitus, too? Unity in opposites and all that. 

	Also! There's a free online audio lecture series on the *Phenomenology* [here](http://www.archive.org/details/LectureCourseInHegelsPhenomenologyOfSpirit) which I found very helpful, if maybe a little...apocryphal.

	I'm no Hegel expert, and I have yet to read much of him in the original. However, I must say that Peter Singer's [Very Short Introduction](http://www.amazon.com/Hegel-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions/dp/019280197X/) was clear and well written. Singer recommends to continue with Richard Norman's [Hegel's Phenomenology](http://www.amazon.com/Hegels-Phenomenology-Philosophical-Introduction-Philosophy/dp/0751200158/) after that. 

	Maybe someone more versed in Hegel can comment on this?

	Hegel's Practical Philosophy: Rational Agency as Ethical Life by Robert Pippin was well argued.

	I'd also second starting with the introductions to some of Hegel's works, though I would start with the introduction to the Phenomenology of Spirit.

	I'd just like to add to the responses this incredible book: [*The Logic of Desire: An Introduction to Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit*](http://www.amazon.com/Logic-Desire-Introduction-Hegels-Phenomenology/dp/1589880374/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328942385&amp;sr=8-1).

	*A reading of Hegel‚Äôs Phenomenology of Spirit* by Quentin Lauer and *The Opening of Hegel's Logic* by Stephen Houlgate are two of the best books to read if you are trying to tackle the *Phenomenology* or *Science of Logic* respectively. Also *Freedom, Truth and History* by Houlgate is a great general introduction to Hegel's thought.

	So, unfortunately with guys like Hegel, a lot of people who read him claim to have two goals:

	1. To figure out what is *really* true philosophically.

	2. To figure out what Hegel *really* meant.

	But in reality they end up conflating the two goals so that they read into Hegel what they consider to be right. WIth dudes as abstruse as Hegel, this isn't that hard to do anyway.

	So, basically I think a good question to ask is: why do you want to read Hegel? Are you just interested what the hype is about? Do you think he can answer a particular problem/question you have?

	If you don't really have a reason other than curiosity is there a particular area of philosophy you are already interested in?
