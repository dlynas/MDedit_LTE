## Life is the biggest game of all

RealLives is a gamified simulation that brings home the challenge of life in its many splendors and complexities.

In the simulation, you will test your mettle against the many unpredictable life conditions that occur in the course of a lifetime – from birth to death.

And in RealLives, you can play billions of such lives, in different cultures and nations on earth - without ever repeating any lifetime!

## RealLives Game Play

### Basic Game Play

When you enter the simulation, you can choose your character attributes (such as country of birth, gender, etc) by clicking on the 'Design a New Life', or you can allow the simulation to randomly allocate the attributes (by directly clicking on 'Live a Life').

Explore the interface to learn the various attributes of your new life. You will see Personal characteristics (like Happiness, Intelligence, Strength, wisdom, etc), as well as information about your family, and the resources possessed by your family.

When you click on the circular ‘Age a Year’ button, you will advance in age and be updated with the latest life events that happen to you or your family. You will also need to take decisions in some life problems. (These events and life problems are calculated on the basis of statistically accurate data of the country that you are born in).

All such events are automatically added to your Life Journal, which is a summary of your life experience.

You are encouraged to write your responses to these various events, and this will be added to your Life-Journal.

As you advance in age, you will be able to handle the 6 aspects of your life; Education, Career, Finance, Relationships, Residence, and Leisure - to create a satisfactory life experience for yourself.

Thus, the scenarios of your life are directly elicited from the data of the country that your are born in, and you are able to make life-decisions based on how you wish to live your life, based on your interpretation of the data-based life-events. You can also use various tools to learn about the culture, socio-economic conditions and other metrics of the country of your birth in the game. Our database now also allows the comparison of such metrics of your birth country in RealLives with those of your actual country, like ranking the achievements in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework, etc.

This provides a realistic narrative of various cultures, political and economic systems, disparities, and so on.

At the end of your life in the game, you can take stock of your entire life. At this point RealLives provides several tools for reflecting on your experience.

The game play also attempts to provide a glimpse into how our lives are influenced by factors that are so often out of our hands, even if we have freedom to make choices.

Finally, it is the recognition of our common humanness and of our universal constraints which creates empathy with other humans across the world.

The RealLives may thus be used for various purposes – to learn socio-economic conditions of the world, to have fun, to learn about disparity and to experience a sense of empathy with fellow humans across the world.
