## What We're About

In the past four decades, a confirmation and expansion of wisdom traditions by scientific rigor has converged with an ever deepening polycrisis.

There has never been a more important time to “grow up”, both personally and collectively. A paradigm shift is underway and we all have a part to play.

The big question is ... how?

Life itself is a home for people who are dedicated to rigorous enquiry and deliberate action for inner growth and cultural evolution in the service of social transformation -- creating an awakening society and a radically wiser, weller world.

Inspired by integral theory, zen buddhism and other key concepts, we cultivate these ideas and apply them to life itself, through deliberately developmental programs and community building.

### [Cultivating an Emerging Paradigm](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2022/02/01/cultivating-an-emerging-paradigm)

"This essay summarizes a jointly developed theory of change. Its central thesis is the need to transition to a new cultural and social paradigm. We set out first why a transition is needed. Second that such a transition must be paradigmatic and involve a major shift in both our socioeconomic systems and in our core views and values. Third, that such a transition needs to prioritize being and the inner dimension."

### [Deliberately Developmental Spaces: a key to addressing the Metacrisis?](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2021/10/05/deliberately-developmental-spaces-a-key-to-addressing-the-metacrisis)

The piece reflects Life Itself’s experience with practically creating developmental spaces in the last five years as well as our research, discussions and engagement with many others. We especially acknowledge ongoing discussions with Tomas Bjorkman and colleagues (whose terminology, borrowed from Robert Kegan’s ‘Deliberately Developmental Organisation’, we have unashamedly adopted and built on) as well as with Oren Slozberg at Commonweal.

### [Pragmatic Utopianism](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2020/12/21/pragmatic-utopianism)

Life Itself's approach to social change is labelled ‘Pragmatic Utopianism’. It differs from most other organisations seeking to improve society.

## What We're Up To

Read about some of our major initiatives.

More than ever there is a deep need for community and connection. Our Conscious Coliving project aims to bring knowledge about living consciously in community to everyone

Charting an emerging ecosystem by Life Itself, Emerge and collaborators. This project maps an emerging ecosystem centred on a radical, alternative approach to social change – one that is simultaneously paradigmatic, integrated and engaged.

Our hubs are micro-cultures which embody \[the values of Life Itself\]. The hubs provide communal environments that support the well-being and self-growth of their residents and foster links with local communities through events, workshops and co-working spaces.
