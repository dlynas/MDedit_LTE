## Early life and education\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Wolf&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and education")\]

Wolf was born in London, in 1946. His father Edmund was an [Austrian Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Jews "Austrian Jews") playwright who migrated from [Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna "Vienna") to England before World War II.<sup id="cite_ref-CalloftheWolf_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-CalloftheWolf-3">[3]</a></sup> In London, Edmund met Wolf's mother, a [Dutch Jew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Jew "Dutch Jew") who had lost nearly thirty close relatives in the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust "Holocaust").<sup id="cite_ref-wolfBio_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-wolfBio-4">[4]</a></sup> Wolf recalls that his background left him wary of political extremes and encouraged his interest in economics, as he felt economic policy mistakes were one of the [root causes of World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_World_War_II "Causes of World War II").<sup id="cite_ref-CalloftheWolf_3-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-CalloftheWolf-3">[3]</a></sup> He was an active supporter of the [Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK) "Labour Party (UK)") until the early 1970s.<sup id="cite_ref-wolfBio_4-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-wolfBio-4">[4]</a></sup>

Wolf was educated at [University College School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_School "University College School"), a day [independent school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_school "Independent school") for boys in [Hampstead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampstead "Hampstead") in north west London, and in 1967 entered [Corpus Christi College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi_College,_Oxford "Corpus Christi College, Oxford") at [Oxford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_University "Oxford University") for his undergraduate studies. He initially studied [classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics "Classics") before switching to [Philosophy, Politics and Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy,_Politics_and_Economics "Philosophy, Politics and Economics").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> As a graduate student Wolf moved on to [Nuffield College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuffield_College,_Oxford "Nuffield College, Oxford"), also at Oxford, which he left with a [Master of Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Philosophy "Master of Philosophy") degree (MPhil) in economics in 1971. Wolf has said that he never pursued a PhD, because he "didn't want to become an academic".<sup id="cite_ref-wolfBio_4-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-wolfBio-4">[4]</a></sup>

## Career\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Wolf&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Career")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Martin_Wolf_World_Economic_Forum_2013.jpg/220px-Martin_Wolf_World_Economic_Forum_2013.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Martin_Wolf_World_Economic_Forum_2013.jpg)

Wolf at the [World Economic Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum "World Economic Forum") in 2013.

In 1971, Wolf joined the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank")'s young professionals programme, becoming a senior economist in 1974. By the start of the eighties, Wolf was deeply disillusioned with the Bank's policies undertaken under the direction of [Robert McNamara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara "Robert McNamara"): the Bank had been strongly pushing for increased capital flows to developing countries, which had resulted in many of them suffering debt crises by the early 1980s. Seeing the results of misjudged intervention by global authorities and also influenced from the early 1970s by various works critical of government intervention, such as [Friedrich Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek "Friedrich Hayek")'s _[The Road to Serfdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Serfdom "The Road to Serfdom")_, Wolf shifted his views towards the right and the free market.<sup id="cite_ref-CalloftheWolf_3-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-CalloftheWolf-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wolfBio_4-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-wolfBio-4">[4]</a></sup>

Wolf left the World Bank in 1981, to become Director of Studies at the _Trade Policy Research Centre_, in London. He joined the _Financial Times_ in 1987, where he has been associate editor since 1990 and chief economics commentator since 1996. Up until the late 2000s, Wolf was an influential advocate of [globalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalisation "Globalisation") and the [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market").

In addition to his journalism and participation in various international forums, Wolf had also attempted to influence opinion with his books; he has stated that his 2004 book, _Why Globalization Works_, was intended to be a persuasive work rather than an academic study. By 2008, Wolf had become disillusioned with theories promoting what he came to see excessive reliance on the [private sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector "Private sector"). While remaining a pragmatist free of binding commitments to any one ideology, Wolf's views partially shifted away from free market thinking back to the Keynesian ideas he had been taught while young.<sup id="cite_ref-CalloftheWolf_3-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-CalloftheWolf-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-wolfBio_4-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-wolfBio-4">[4]</a></sup>

He became one of the more influential drivers of the [2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932009_Keynesian_resurgence "2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence"), and in late 2008 and early 2009, he used his platform on the _Financial Times_ to advocate a massive fiscal and monetary response to the [financial crisis of 2007–2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932010 "Financial crisis of 2007–2010"). According to [Julia Ioffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Ioffe "Julia Ioffe") writing in 2009 for _[The New Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic "The New Republic")_, he was "arguably the most widely trusted pundit" of the crisis.<sup id="cite_ref-CalloftheWolf_3-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-CalloftheWolf-3">[3]</a></sup> Wolf is a supporter of a [land value tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax "Land value tax").<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

Between 2010 and 2011, Wolf served on the [Independent Commission on Banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Commission_on_Banking "Independent Commission on Banking").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (May 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In 2012, Wolf stated in remarks for the Financial Times that [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goods "Public goods") are building blocks of civilisation: security and safety, knowledge and science, a [sustainable environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability "Sustainability"), trust, the [Rechtsstaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechtsstaat "Rechtsstaat"), and economic and financial stability.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

Wolf discussed the [economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic") in an April 2020 editorial for the _Financial Times_ titled "The world economy is now collapsing", where he called it the "biggest economic disaster since the [Depression of the 1930s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression")".<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

## Views\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martin_Wolf&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Views")\]

Wolf maintained in December 2022 the government's failure to maintain real pay in the public sector had an adverse effect on recruitment and retention of staff. Since 2010 real average pay rose 5.5% in the private sector till September 2022, but fell 5.9% in the public sector. If it wanted to, the government could raise taxes to pay for pay rises. There were too few key public sector staff and their quality raised concerns. NHS England data "show a vacancy rate of 11.9 per cent as at September 30 2022 within the Registered Nursing staff group (47,496 vacancies). This is an increase from the same period in the previous year, when the vacancy rate was 10.5 per cent (39,931 vacancies)." Also too few teachers were recruited in subjects like physics or design & technology. Poor health damaged labour supply. Allowing inflation to bring real pay down and expecting services to maintain or improve standards was in Wolf's opinion "plainly dishonest." Wolf stated the government should keep public sector pay comparable with private sector pay particularly where there are noteworthy recruitment and retention issues.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wolf#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
