## Annelle Sheline is the latest State Department official to resign in protest of U.S. support for Israelâ€™s assault on Gaza. Sheline worked as a foreign affairs officer in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and was not planning on publicly resigning, but her colleagues asked her to "please speak out" against the Biden administration's unconditional support for Israel. 

"At the end of the day, many people inside [the State Department] know that this is a horrific policy, and can't believe that the United States government is engaged in such actions that contravene American values so directly, but the leadership is not listening," says Sheline. "I'm trying to speak on behalf of those many, many people who feel so betrayed by our government's stance."

"I hadn't initially planned to resign publicly.
I hadn't been at state for very long,
and I didn't think it would necessarily matter.
But I decided to go public because when I started to tell colleagues
that I was planning to resign over Gaza,
so many people's response was, please speak out, please speak for us.
At the end of the day, many people inside state know that this is a horrific policy
and can't believe that the United States government is engaged in such actions
that contravene American values so directly.
But the leadership is not listening.
The evidence speaks for itself.
We've had not only the ICJ's ruling,
not only the UN Security Council ruling.
Clearly, the administration is unwilling to admit to reality.
And again, I just want to reiterate,
I think this is not only, obviously, devastating for the lives of people in Gaza,
but is doing incredible damage to America's standing on the international stage.
It is incredibly demoralizing for people inside the State Department,
many of whom believe very deeply in what America says it stands for.
So I'm trying to speak on behalf of those many, many people who feel so betrayed
by our government stance. "
