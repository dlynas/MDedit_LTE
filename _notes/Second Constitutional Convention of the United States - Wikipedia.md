The calling of a **Second Constitutional Convention of the United States** is a proposal made by some academics and activists from across the [political spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum "Political spectrum") for the purpose of making substantive reforms to the [federal government of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") by rewriting the [U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Constitution "U.S. Constitution").<sup id="cite_ref-twsDecM4y4_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsDecM4y4-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-twsDecM3435_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsDecM3435-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Background\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")\]

Since the initial 1787â€“88 debate over ratification of the Constitution, there have been sporadic calls for the convening of a second convention to modify and correct perceived shortcomings in the Federal system it established. [Article V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution "Article Five of the United States Constitution") of the Constitution provides two methods for amending the nation's frame of government. The first method authorizes Congress, "whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary" to propose constitutional amendments. The second method requires Congress, "on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states" (presently 34), to "call a [Convention of States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_to_propose_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution") for proposing amendments".<sup id="cite_ref-A5convetion_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-A5convetion-3">[3]</a></sup>

In 1943, Alexander Hehmeyer, a lawyer for [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago,_Illinois "Chicago, Illinois")\-based Marshall Field's department store as well as [Time Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Inc. "Time Inc."), wrote _A Time for Change_ (Farrar & Rinehart), in which he proposed a second Constitutional Convention to streamline the federal government.<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW23_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW23-4">[4]</a></sup> In the late 1960s, Illinois [Senator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") [Everett Dirksen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Dirksen "Everett Dirksen") called for a constitutional convention by appealing to state legislatures to summon one.<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW12_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW12-5">[5]</a></sup>

Three times in the 20th century, concerted efforts were undertaken by proponents of particular issues to secure the number of applications necessary to summon an Article V Convention. These included conventions to consider amendments to provide for popular election of U.S. Senators, permit the states to include factors other than equality of population in drawing state legislative [district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district "Electoral district") boundaries, and to propose an [amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget_amendment "Balanced budget amendment") requiring the U.S. budget to be balanced under most circumstances. The campaign for a popularly elected Senate is frequently credited with "prodding" the Senate to join the House of Representatives in proposing what became the [Seventeenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution") to the states in 1912,<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#What_information_to_include" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="A complete citation is needed.

In 1983, [Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Missouri "State of Missouri") applied;<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> in 2013, [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Ohio "State of Ohio") applied.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

In January 1975, [Congressman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives") [Jerry Pettis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pettis "Jerry Pettis"), a [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)") from [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California"), introduced a [concurrent resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_resolution "Concurrent resolution") ([94th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_United_States_Congress "94th United States Congress") H.Con.Res.28<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>) calling a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution. In it, Pettis proposed that each state would be entitled to send as many delegates to the convention as it had Senators and Representatives in Congress and that such delegates would be selected in the manner designated by the legislature of each state. On August 5, 1977, Representative [Norman F. Lent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_F._Lent "Norman F. Lent"), Republican from [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state) "New York (state)"), introduced a similar concurrent resolution ([95th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/95th_United_States_Congress "95th United States Congress") H.Con.Res.340<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>). Both were referred to the [House Judiciary Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Judiciary_Committee "House Judiciary Committee"). No further action on either was taken.

A report in the _[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette")_ in 2011 described the movement for a convention as gaining "traction" in public debate,<sup id="cite_ref-twsDecM3435_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsDecM3435-2">[2]</a></sup> and wrote that "concern over a seemingly dysfunctional climate in Washington and issues ranging from the national debt to the overwhelming influence of money in politics have spawned calls for fundamental change in the document that guides the nation's government."<sup id="cite_ref-twsDecM3435_2-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsDecM3435-2">[2]</a></sup> For several years, state lawmakers approved no Article V Convention calls at all, and even went so far as to adopt resolutions [rescinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rescissions_of_Article_V_Convention_Applications "List of Rescissions of Article V Convention Applications") their prior such calls. However, in 2011, legislators in Alabama, Louisiana, and North Dakota (in two instances) approved resolutions applying for an Article V Convention. All three of these states had adopted rescissions in 1988, 1990, and 2001, respectively, but then reversed course in 2011. The same was true in 2012 with New Hampshire lawmakers who had adopted a resolution to rescind previous convention applications as recently as 2010.

A [Convention of States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_to_propose_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution") is one of two methods authorized by [Article Five of the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution "Article Five of the United States Constitution") whereby amendments to the [United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution "United States Constitution") may be proposed: two thirds of the State legislatures (that is, 34 of the 50) may call a convention to propose amendments, which become law only after [ratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification#Ratification_in_the_United_States_Constitution "Ratification") by three-fourths (38) of the [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state "U.S. state"). The Article V convention method by States has never been used.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

## Questions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Questions")\]

Numerous questions surround the issue of how such an unprecedented convention might be conducted.<sup id="cite_ref-twsDecMfrhh_19-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsDecMfrhh-19">[19]</a></sup> There is no consensus on how such a convention may be organized, led, or who may be selected to be in such a body.

> Because there has not been a constitutional convention since 1787, efforts have been clouded by unresolved legal questions: Do the calls for a convention have to happen at the same time? Can a convention be limited to just one topic? What if Congress simply refuses to call a convention? Scholars are split on all those issues.

### Precedent\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Precedent")\]

While there is no precedent for such a convention, scholars have noted that the original [1787 Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States) "Constitutional Convention (United States)"), itself, was the first precedent, as it had only been authorized to amend the [Articles of Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation "Articles of Confederation"), not to draw up an entirely new frame of government.<sup id="cite_ref-twsDecMfrhh_19-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsDecMfrhh-19">[19]</a></sup> According to _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_, the action by the [Founding Fathers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States "Founding Fathers of the United States") set up a precedent that could be used today.<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW24_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW24-25">[25]</a></sup> But, since 1787, there has not been an overall constitutional convention.<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW34_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW34-26">[26]</a></sup> Instead, each time the amendment process has been initiated since 1789, it has been initiated by Congress. All 33 amendments submitted to the states for ratification originated there. The convention option, which [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton "Alexander Hamilton") (writing in The [Federalist No. 85](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._85 "Federalist No. 85")) believed would serve as a barrier "against the encroachments of the national authority",<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> has yet to be successfully invoked, although not for lack of activity in the states.

### Scope of a possible convention\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Scope of a possible convention")\]

There have been calls for a second convention based on a single issue such as the [Balanced Budget Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_Budget_Amendment "Balanced Budget Amendment"). According to one count, 17 of 34 states have petitioned Congress for a "convention to propose a balanced budget amendment."<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW33_24-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW33-24">[24]</a></sup> But Congress has been reluctant to "impose limitations on its spending and borrowing and taxing powers", according to anti-tax activist David Biddulph.<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW33_24-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW33-24">[24]</a></sup> Law professor Michael Stokes Paulsen suggested that such a convention would have the "power to propose anything it sees fit" and that calls for a convention to focus on only one issue "may not be valid", according to this view.<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW33_24-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW33-24">[24]</a></sup> According to Paulsen's count, 33 states have called for a general convention, although some of these calls have been pending "since the 19th century."<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW33_24-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW33-24">[24]</a></sup>

According to a _[New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times "New York Times")_ report, different groups would be nervous that a convention summoned to address only one issue might propose a wholesale revision of the entire Constitution, possibly limiting "provisions they hold dear."<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW24_25-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW24-25">[25]</a></sup> Such groups include the [American Civil Liberties Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union "American Civil Liberties Union"), the [John Birch Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society "John Birch Society"), the [National Organization for Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Women "National Organization for Women"), the Gun Owners Clubs of America and conservative advocate [Phyllis Schlafly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Schlafly "Phyllis Schlafly").<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW24_25-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW24-25">[25]</a></sup> Accordingly, they are opposed to the idea of a second convention.<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW24_25-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW24-25">[25]</a></sup> [Lawrence Lessig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig "Lawrence Lessig") countered that the requirement of having 38 states ratify any proposed revisionâ€”three-quarters of all state legislaturesâ€”meant that any extreme proposals would be blocked, since either [13 red or 13 blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states "Red states and blue states") states could block such a measure.<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW33_24-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW33-24">[24]</a></sup>

### Language\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Language")\]

Constitutional law scholar [Laurence Tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Tribe "Laurence Tribe") noted that the language in the current Constitution about how to implement a second one is "dangerously vague", and that there is a possibility that the same interests that have corrupted Washington's politics may have a hand in efforts to rewrite it.<sup id="cite_ref-twsDecM3435_2-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsDecM3435-2">[2]</a></sup> Politicians and scholars who are reluctant to have a second constitutional convention may insist that all 34 state petitions to Congress must have an identical wording or otherwise the petitions would be considered invalid.<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW14_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW14-8">[8]</a></sup>

Lawrence Lessig

[Harvard Law School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Law_School "Harvard Law School") professor [Lawrence Lessig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig "Lawrence Lessig") has argued that a movement to urge state legislatures to call for a Constitutional Convention<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW33_24-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW33-24">[24]</a></sup> was the best possibility to achieve substantive reform:

> But somebody at the convention said that "what if Congress is the problemâ€”what do we do then?" So they set up an alternative path ... that states can call on Congress to call a Convention. The convention, then, proposes the amendments, and those amendments have to pass by three fourths of the states. So, either way, thirty eight states have to ratify an amendment, but the sources of those amendments are different. One is _inside_, one is _outside_.

Lessig argued that the ordinary means of politics were not feasible to solve the problem affecting the United States government because the incentives corrupting politicians are so powerful.<sup id="cite_ref-twsDecMupoi_28-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsDecMupoi-28">[28]</a></sup> Lessig believes a convention is needed in view of Supreme Court decisions to eliminate most limits on [campaign contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_contribution "Campaign contribution").<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW13_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW13-29">[29]</a></sup> He quoted [congressperson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") [Jim Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cooper "Jim Cooper") from [Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee "Tennessee") who remarked that Congress had become a "Farm League for [K Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_Street_(Washington,_D.C.) "K Street (Washington, D.C.)")" in the sense that congresspersons were focused on lucrative careers as [lobbyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States "Lobbying in the United States") after serving in the Congress, and not on serving the public interest.<sup id="cite_ref-twsDecM9009_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsDecM9009-30">[30]</a></sup> He proposed that such a convention be constrained by the decisions of state-based "citizen assemblies," assemblies composed of a random and representative selection of citizens, as a way to keep special interests out of the process.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

Constitutional scholar and [University of Texas Law School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_Law_School "University of Texas Law School") professor [Sanford Levinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_Levinson "Sanford Levinson") wrote _Our Undemocratic Constitution: Where the Constitution Goes Wrong_ and called for a "wholesale revision of our nation's founding document."<sup id="cite_ref-tws10oct_32-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws10oct-32">[32]</a></sup> Levinson wrote:

> We ought to think about it almost literally every day, and then ask, 'Well, to what extent is government organized to realize the noble visions of the preamble?' That the preamble begins, 'We the people.' It's a notion of a people that can engage in self-determination.

[Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee "Tennessee") law professor [Glenn Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Reynolds "Glenn Reynolds"), in a keynote speech at [Harvard Law School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Law_School "Harvard Law School"), said the movement for a new convention was a reflection of having in many ways "the worst political class in our country's history."<sup id="cite_ref-twsDecM3435_2-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsDecM3435-2">[2]</a></sup>

[Political scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_scientist "Political scientist") [Larry Sabato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sabato "Larry Sabato") believes a second convention is necessary since "piecemeal amendments" have not been working.<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW22_15-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW22-15">[15]</a></sup> Sabato argued that America needs a "grand meeting of clever and high-minded people to draw up a new, improved constitution better suited to the 21st century."<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW22_15-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW22-15">[15]</a></sup>

Author [Scott Turow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Turow "Scott Turow") sees risks with a possible convention but believes it may be the only possible way to undo how campaign money has undermined the "one-man one-vote" premise.<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovW13_29-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsNovW13-29">[29]</a></sup>

Few new constitutions are modeled along the lines of the U.S. one, according to a study by David Law of [Washington University in St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis "Washington University in St. Louis").<sup id="cite_ref-MassDailyCollegian_34-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-MassDailyCollegian-34">[34]</a></sup> Supreme Court Justice [Ruth Bader Ginsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg "Ruth Bader Ginsburg") viewed the United States Constitution as more of a relic of the 18th century rather than as a model for new constitutions. She suggested in 2012 that a nation seeking a new constitution might find a better model by examining the [Constitution of South Africa (1997)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_South_Africa "Constitution of South Africa"), the [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms "Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms") and the [European Convention on Human Rights (1950)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights "European Convention on Human Rights").<sup id="cite_ref-MassDailyCollegian_34-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States#cite_note-MassDailyCollegian-34">[34]</a></sup>

> I would not look to the United States Constitution if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012.
