	\> and I am extremely fascinated by his philosophy

	Now, Kant is one of the most important thinkers in history of philosophy, one who changed – well I'm not going to say everything, but a lot – but I've never heard anyone say that out loud. I'm going to bookmark this thread and use it as a weapon:)

	Three ideas.

	First of all, I wouldn't dismiss "introductory texts". Delving deeper into very particular arguments is absolutely necessary, but so is getting a wider view – and even going back to absolute basics (or even questioning them), it always helps. Once you've read the source material by yourself, perhaps getting some introductory ones and arguing with them when your interpretation differs a bit and agreeing when you're on the same side would help? I've often read and reread introductory books on thinkers I've read properly and they've always helped me in some way.

	Secondly, entire German idealism was based on Kant. Looking at how he was read in his own era is a brilliant way to "delve a little deeper", so Fichte – Schelling – Hegel (– and perhaps late Schelling?) would make a great reading list.

	Thirdly, perhaps some weird Kantians, neo-Kantians and non-Kantians would do? There was a resurrection of Kant in Germany with Neo-Kantianism, and then there was a brilliant debate between Cassirer and Heidegger on Kant in 1929 (you can also look for Heidegger's Kantbuch as well, which is a very violent \[re\]interpretation of Kant in Heideggerian terms). Recently, Maurizio Ferraris published "Goodbye, Kant! What Still Stands of the Critique of Pure Reason", now it wasn't as brilliant as the title suggest but worth reading. 

	And – I just bloody love *Cambridge companions*, it's a brilliant series. There's a *Cambridge Companion to Kant*, *Cambridge Companion to Kand and Modern Philosophy* and *Cambridge Companion to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason*. Now I'm not a Kantian scholar in any way, but no volume of that series has ever let me down; they begin with very approachable introductions but end up as pretty serious examination of the subject.

		Thank you for all the suggestions. I was interested of grabbing a copy of The Cambridge Companion to Kant and Modern Philosophy by Paul Guyer, but I was under the impression it was more of an introductory text. I think you’ve sold me on it though!

			* 🟦 **[paulstevanovic](https://www.reddit.com/user/paulstevanovic) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-06-05 04:57:55)_

				There is no issue. I just find that they tend to be more-accessible substitutes for the primary texts. This is just what I have seen from looking through a couple of them- I could be wrong. 
				
				I just assume that I would be less likely to find what I am looking for in one.

					Okay, yeah that makes sense. I've always found some use at least for introductory texts in giving me an interpretation of the author by somebody else. But I definitely see your point

			Seriously? A pretty established branch of thought, SEP or not SEP, even Wikipedia has a more than decent info on that.
			
			Edit: okay, sorry for being rude. Wikipedia does give you the basic historical info and positions of German idealists – [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German\_idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_idealism) – and SEP, which is Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, a great resource but with a tilt towards the analytical side, which values German idealism very low, has entries on all of the main thinkers I mentioned: [https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/hegel/](https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/hegel/) – and there you'll find links to Fichte (who's getting more and more noisy in philosophy, not bad for a thinker who's been dead for 200 years) and Schelling. Again, sorry for being rude, I forgot myself.

	You could always keep reading more Kant. In terms of applying his ethics and metaphysics, his political philosophy is really interesting. Cambridge’s *Kant Political Writings* is a really great collection of his most significant political thought.

	You could also read some contemporary philosophers who were hugely inspired by Kant. Rawls’ *Theory of Justice* and Korsgaard’s *Fellow Creatures* both try to apply Kant’s ethics in new ways towards addressing some of today’s most important ethical and political problems.

	* 🟨 **[paulstevanovic](https://www.reddit.com/user/paulstevanovic) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-06-04 22:24:42)_

		I have actually never read any political philosophy, but I think Kant would be a great way to get me into it. Thanks for the recommendation!

	Are there any particular issues you want to look into more, or approaches to the text you'd like to explore?

	* 🟨 **[paulstevanovic](https://www.reddit.com/user/paulstevanovic) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-06-04 22:42:34)_

		I am quite interested in his idea of the Kingdom of Ends, perhaps using it to critique certain political systems? I would also like to get a sense of people with contrasting views, so maybe something critical of his ideas? I feel as though for some of his ideas, such as the categorical imperative, arguments against them could have some merit.

		* 🟧 **[wokeupabug](https://www.reddit.com/user/wokeupabug)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-06-06 13:48:57)_

			If you're interested in Kant's political philosophy, I would say first of all that you should read his *What is Enlightenment?* and *Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose*. Consider also his *Perpetual Peace* and the first part (the Doctrine of Right) of his *Metaphysics of Morals*, if you haven't read that yet.
			
			While you're doing that, have a look at the contents of Beiner and Booth's (eds.) *Kant and Political Philosophy: The Contemporary Legacy* and Ellis' (ed.) *Kant’s Political Theory: Interpretations and Applications* to see if anything in them catches your interest.

	Allison has several books on Kant. Beiser is very good to have an idea of the whole period of german idealism. I've often heard Guyer as an important Kantian scholar.

	* 🟨 **[paulstevanovic](https://www.reddit.com/user/paulstevanovic) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-06-04 22:26:48)_

		I think I will look into all of these. I’ve also heard that Guyer is arguably a compulsory read for anyone interested in Kant.

	'Categories of the Temporal: An Inquiry into the Forms of the Finite Understanding' by Sebastian Rödl

	Might be of interest. It's not *exclusively* focused on Kant but I think if you're interested in extensions and applications of Kant that aren't just explanations and interpretations, this meets your criteria.

	> The publication of Frege’s Begriffsschrift in 1879 forever altered the landscape for many Western philosophers. Here, Sebastian Rödl traces how the Fregean influence, written all over the development and present state of analytic philosophy, led into an unholy alliance of an empiricist conception of sensibility with an inferentialist conception of thought. According to Rödl, Wittgenstein responded to the implosion of Frege’s principle that the nature of thought consists in its inferential order, but his Philosophical Investigations shied away from offering an alternative. Rödl takes up the challenge by turning to Kant and Aristotle as ancestors of this tradition, and in doing so identifies its unacknowledged question: the relation of judgment and truth to time. Rödl finds in the thought of these two men the answer he urges us to consider: the temporal and the sensible, and the atemporal and the intelligible, are aspects of one reality and cannot be understood independently of one another. In demonstrating that an investigation into the categories of the temporal can be undertaken as a contribution to logic, Rödl seeks to transform simultaneously our philosophical understanding of both logic and time.

	If you're interested in transcendental idealism specifically, you could look at some of the texts listed under the "two-objects interpretation" and the "two-aspects interpretation" headings here:

	[https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/kant/#TwoObjInt](https://plato.stanford.ed[u/entries](https://www.reddit.com/user/entries)/kant/#TwoObjInt)

	This is essentially the difference between a metaphysical and epistemological interpretation of Kant's transcendental idealism. Allison's Kant\`s Transcendental Idealism – An Interpretation and Defense is often recommended. I read a good chunk of it years ago, and thought it was good.

	You could also check out Strawson's *The Bounds of Sense* if you want something a little outside the box. Don't think that this is Kant, though--it's Strawson's own (quite insular but interesting) take on Kant's Critique.

	Alternatively, you could explore some post-Kantian philosophy. I always recommend Fichte, but he's my main philosopher, so I am biased in that regard. 

	Fichte would be interesting for someone interested in Kant for (IMO) two reasons: (1) He calls himself a Kantian and yet denies the existence of things-in-themselves. He thinks Kant believes this, too! Check out subsection 6 of Fichte's *Second Introduction to the Wissenschaftslehre: For Readers Who Already Have a Philosophical System of Their Own.* This interpretation of Kant is interesting, and Fichte gives reasons for thinking it to be correct, by Kant's own words. Whether it's a correct interpretation or not, it might provide new ways of thinking about transcendental idealism. (2) He think that Kant's explanation of morality is too objective and does not account for true freedom. How can one remain truly free if moral commands of duty are found in a rationalised and objective form of the categorical imperative? Fichte argues that this is only the objectified form of the moral impetus, and its true locus is in subjectively felt moral duty and conscience, which is a manifestation of the drive for drive's sake, the self-positing of the I, or infinite will.

		Thanks for the great response. You’ve made a great case for Fichte, I will definitely be looking into his work :)

		* 🟧 **[J-Fox-Writing](https://www.reddit.com/user/J-Fox-Writing)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-06-04 23:00:44)_

			Awesome!
			
			For secondary introductory reading, there's obviously his SEP page. But Beiser's chapter on Fichte in his *German Idealism* is good. If you're more into practical/moral philosophy Allen Wood's *Fichte's Ethical Thought* is good. For primary texts, personally I'd start with Fichte's *The Vocation of Man* (Peter Preuss translation), and for some biography mixed with a great overview of Fichte's overall system, Robert Adamson's *Fichte* is good (it's old, but still holds up great IMO).
			
			\[edit\]
			
			Also anything by Daniel Breazeale on Fichte is fantastic.

				I appreciate all the help. This seems like a natural direction to go in post-Kant.

				* 🟪 **[J-Fox-Writing](https://www.reddit.com/user/J-Fox-Writing)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-06-05 07:17:57)_

					No probs!
					
					One final recommendation (and I don't know how I didn't think of this right away). Wayne M. Martin's chapter/essay *From Kant to Fichte* in the Cambridge Companion to Fichte is great for anyone interested in Kant and Fichte:
					
					[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-companion-to-fichte/from-kant-to-fichte/4722C0CDD83D4FAEB558326BA1DC2846#access-block](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/cambridge-companion-to-fichte/from-kant-to-fichte/4722C0CDD83D4FAEB558326BA1DC2846#access-block)
					
					The shortened version is something like: Reinhold (a Kantian at the time) tried to explain Kant's system in terms of a single first principle of knowledge, this being the principle of representation. Schulz criticised Reinhold and Kant by saying that the mind must have a more basic acqaintance with subject, object, and representation, before representation can take place (so Kant hasn't got to the 'bottom' of transcendental enquiry yet). Fichte agreed, but thought that our basic acquaintance with these things must come from the self--acts of the self through which the self relates itself to itself and distinguishes itself from objects. In other words, he thought it must be explained by a transcendentally foundational self-consciousness that distinguishes subject and object.

	Christine Korsgard (mentioned above) also has a book called Creating the Kingdom of Ends that's good - a collection of her essays on Kant (she's a philosophy professor at Harvard)

	Also really liked Sebastian Gardner's Routledge Guidebook to the first critique.
