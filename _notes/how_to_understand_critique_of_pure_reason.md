## How to understand Critique of Pure Reason?

What I’m asking here is what all do you recommend I read, or watch (like lectures) to help me fully understand this book? Thanks.

	Leaving the thread up for now because it's gotten answers/there is some back and forth in the comments but, /[u/vomit_blues](https://www.reddit.com/user/vomit_blues), for future reference please include more in the OP for people to respond to; clarification/source questions are fine but should include at least some degree of specificity in order to foster discussion. Thank you.

	This is perhaps one of the best lecture series that I’ve ever listened to explaining Kant. It’s a bit long (but reading the Critique is longer anyway), but it is very informative and digestible: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo0o3xtOPNLgnl2CtaxNHzie1TUWt_bp4&amp;si=l-OPzbIc6uvCRx1w

	I'm of the opinion that it's usually a waste of time to do preparatory readings in advance of tackling one of the major canonised texts. You don’t know what you don’t know and will likely fall into a rabbit hole that ends up confusing and/or delaying you more. If anything, do the preparatory readings after you’ve read the thing they prepare for. And instead go straight into it armed with some secondary literature – which the first critique has tonnes of. These secondaries will at the very least make explicit the gaps in your knowledge, and more often than not will just outright fill the gaps for you.

	Two titans of secondary lit for the first critique are:

	Peter Strawson – *Bounds of Sense*

	Henry Allison – *Kant’s Transcendental Idealism*

	I heavily recommend Allison. He seems far more interested in understanding Kant as Kant would’ve understood himself, and I simply take his reading to be more correct than Strawson’s. Although Strawson has had an undeniably massive impact on Kant’s reception in the Anglosphere. Regardless, they offer radically different readings of Kant, so pick one and run with it.

	Alternatively, there’s:

	Sebastian Gardner – *Kant and the Critique of Pure Reason*

	I haven’t read Gardner, but I know professors like introducing undergrads to Kant through him. So he might be worthwhile if you neither mesh well with Allison nor Strawson. All three secondaries should be easy to find online.

	Jump straight into the first critique. Read it slowly. Refer to the secondary when stuck. Or read the secondary a section ahead of the primary. Do whatever works for you. But just don’t fall into the trap of thinking you need to be well prepared before jumping in – Kant and the Kantians do all the legwork for you.

	In the development of modern philosophy, Kant comes at a critical point when empiricism and rationalism epistemologies are competing against one another and exhaust their creative space. Kant attempts to merge the two epistemologies by showing the short comings of both pure rationalism and pure empiricism. He essentially showcases that neither have a foundation of certainty as much as we would like in epistemology. 

	In some sense, he closes the book on a lot of speculative metaphysics. On the other hand, the German idealist take it in the exact opposite direction - it inspires a great flourishing of metaphysics for the German idealists.

	I spent spring break of my freshman year holed up in a studio apartment with a 3 liter bottle(s) of Gallo burgundy and everyone out of town and burned through it, finishing it that month.   Not really worth it.  While I can pat myself on the back and say I looked at all the pages and underlined a lot, understanding Kant and reading that particular book are two separate tasks.  To read critique of pure reason cold like I did is mostly meaningless.    The important part is understanding that western philosophy is a conversation being had across time.    Kant is directly responding to Hume, and others of his time who is in turn are responding to several out of fashion Christian theologians (acquinas or Augustine or something) who were trying to shoehorn Roman and Greek philosophy into Christian theology.   As a result, people were wantonly misinterpreting both Aristotle and Plato, who in turn was simply trying to wrap structure around that hippie Socrates’ brilliant drunken rants.   Now what’s cool is that Socrates and  siddharta Gautama and Confucius were approximately contemporary and using largely the same oral tradition based, dialectical method of examination, so it could be argued that western philosophy is one branch of what was originally a Pangeaic original oral tradition about fucking with people who ask stupid questions for clout.  Buddha was all about deconstructing the question, as was Socrates, and rather than answering a question that is poorly worded to present a false dichotomy, these tricksters hijack the question and take it in a completely different direction.  Maybe more Lao Tzu than confuscious come to think of it but all these characters are largely fictional constructs.   Anyway, if you don’t understand all of that context first, and you read the critique cold, you will have no framework for understanding what the hell he is talking about and it will all seem empty, which ultimately it is, according to Socrates, and Buddha.   The  attempt to definitively structure reason is flawed because it’s simply not how brains or reasoning work.   What it does do is launch off Hegel and others who create the foundation for modern law, jurisprudence, finance, insurance, computer science quantum mechanics and basically everything else.

		With my OP being vague on or I guess totally lacking on my current knowing I get where you’re coming from asking all of this. I have read all of Plato and Aristotle, the Analects of Confucius, the Daodejing and the Zhuangzi. Basically I know about this older dialectical method you’re talking about.
		
		The interest in Kant I’m showing here is misleading because my OP doesn’t say why I’m reading Kant. I actually am even more interested in Hegel. About a year ago I started on a long binge of Marxist literature and eventually when confronted by enough of this you start to wonder what Hegel was all about. But even then I know Hegel is as you said jumping off from Kant and since Kant was important for Materialism and Empirio-criticism and a subject of Marx’s critique why not start with Kant?
		
		So all this stuff about the conversation and dialectics I totally understand and I think I already have the mindset you’re trying to get at. I never wanted to just jump into the Critique of Pure Reason for its own sake, I’m actually trying to backtrack through the conversation and get the bigger picture.

			Then the only piece your missing is the Aquinas/Augustine stuff.   Very uncool but very important for understanding. Why “a thing in itself” and an ideal or platonic Idea of a thing gets mapped to the ineffable Holy Spirit and the god-made-flesh held as a thing distinct.   Trying to rationalize the Trinity which any rational person would clearly see to be bullshit, is basically what propelled Kant, a Christian, to try to definitively establish “Reason” within that Christian framework, which is why things get so fucked.    TLDR,  Plato misunderstood Socrates when he speculated on a realm of noumena and a realm of phenomena.  Socrates was drunk.    He was spitballing concepts, but Aristotle and others who studied under  them missed the poetry, they missed the irony, they missed the joke and took it all literally, a trend that continues to this day with Derrida trying to be the trickster poet philosopher and what’s his name who can’t get over Lacan, Freudianism and superficial Marxism to come up with an original idea of his own.

			* 🟦 **[vomit_blues](https://www.reddit.com/user/vomit_blues) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-26 19:29:39)_

				I’d read Aquinas’ Five Ways at the suggestion of a friend’s purely out of curiosity but didn’t revisit it. Is there a specific thing from him you think is worth reading?
				
				Funny quip about Zizek. Totally unrelated then but ignoring the “new” philosophers which of the PM/post-structuralist thinkers do you view as on the mark with dialectics.

				* 🟪 **[hudsoncress](https://www.reddit.com/user/hudsoncress)** ⬆️ 5 _(2024-04-26 19:54:16)_

					My heart is with Derrida.   I think Glas was a brilliant fuck you to basically everything.   And Plato’s Pharmacy genuinely changed the way I think today, so, missions accomplished.    I believe Socrates and siddharta among others but specifically those two are unique in that they wrote nothing down on their own, and purely by rhetorical method launched movements that spanned a couple thousand of years and basically defined the channels along which philosophy has travelled ever since.   The difference was Buddha had a solid 50 years to build a brand, and only a couple hundred years later Ashoka canonized everything.   Socrates is known only through anecdotes by comparison.  Funny stories you’d tell around dinner about really clever comebacks.   But Aristotle is more on par with what you find in the Tripatika, which essentially tells you all you need to know about both of them.   The spirit is behind the canon somewhere.    Derrida is the only philosopher I’ve found who has that same sort of radical break with tradition, and truly unique spin on things.  Glas took balls of chrome-vanadium hardened steel to produce.  Even in France.   Nobody talks about it.  Ever.   It’s that good.  The best fuck you to the man in my opinion since the Trojan Horse.

	You might find the Early Modern Texts version helpful. Kant is a great thinker, but a terrible writer, so the "translation" into modern and straightforward English can be very helpful especially when starting out with him

		Thanks! I used their version of the Groundwork because my physical copy is pretty antiquated, but I was slightly worried that there might be a confusion in terminology. I assume since you’re recommending this, that shouldn’t be a problem.

	The subreddit's reading list starts pretty late in time.  You'll be very much lost without reading Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. Aristotle's Physics and Metaphysics would also probably be helpful. As someone said above the Prolegomena to All Future Metaphysics is also helpful. Descartes Method and Meditation on first Philosophy is also generally helpful when reading a lot of later philosophy.    

	    

	If you read nothing else read Hume though. COPR is almost literally a response to Hume

	* 🟨 **[vomit_blues](https://www.reddit.com/user/vomit_blues) (OP)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-04-26 11:40:02)_

		I’ve read both from Aristotle. I’d actually considered reading Hume because of the connection but wasn’t sure if the reading list was an indication it wasn’t necessary for Kant. If I go that route, is Hume any clearer than Kant? I’m willing to read/watch whatever you think will make it clearest.

		* 🟧 **[redditaccount001](https://www.reddit.com/user/redditaccount001)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-04-26 17:04:05)_

			Hume is clearer than Kant but it’s not necessary to actually read Hume’s books to understand Kant. There are points where it’s useful to know what Hume thinks about things like causality and knowledge but it really depends on the level of understanding that you’re trying to attain. 
			
			Kant generally tells you what he’s arguing against, he doesn’t really use names or terminology with the assumption that his reader gets the reference (like you might see in more modern critical theory)

			* 🟦 **[vomit_blues](https://www.reddit.com/user/vomit_blues) (OP)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-26 18:35:46)_

				A lot of the names being mentioned in the thread are all people I’d wanted to read at some point anyway, and Hume was a big one. The way I see it for now, and you can tell me if you think it’s not worth it, I’d be fine with treating unpacking the Critique of Pure Reason as a project and I’m willing to read and take the time to build a framework or toolset to do that.
				
				Really I’m considering this approach because it’s how I understood Capital. I read about ten chapters of it and got a lot out of it, but ended up never following through. After that, though, I read a ton of later Marxist writers who gave me a stronger sense of the terminology and what dialectical thinking actually is. Once I returned to Capital, I tore through it extremely quickly and found it a lot more rewarding and it affected my thought process profoundly.
				
				Having that experience is what drew me to this subreddit’s reading list, so I can find another book to treat this way.

		* 🟧 **[just4PAD](https://www.reddit.com/user/just4PAD)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-26 13:38:36)_

			I would recommend Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding as someone's first philosophy book if they had an interest in the subject. It's very clear, it can be read in a vacuum, and also one of the most important works of philosophy period. 
			
			The subs reading list is made for someone with a background in philosophy, it doesn't cover the "prerequisites". Not that you need to read philosophy in chronological order, but its super helpful when you're engaging in the more notoriously difficult works like COPR. I read a lot of stuff way out of order and went back later to fill in the gaps. It won't help with Kant per se, but the other older works I would strongly recommend are Spinoza's Ethics and Theologico-Political Treatise.

		It’s definitely not necessary to actually read Hume’s Enquiry or Treatise to understand Kant. You can just use secondary sources that more concisely get to the main points. It’s too easy to get sucked down the rabbit hole of background reading.

	This book got me through Hegel class, and more recently (years later) completely revolutionized my life. I’d recommend it up through chapter 7, which completes the main parts of Critique of Pure Reason! The next two books are fanfics, his first book was his opus for sure — it’s the part he thought would preclude any other kind of metaphysics ever, after all. 

	http://staffweb.hkbu.edu.hk/ppp/ksp1/toc.html

	If the whole thing is too much, I at least recommend bookmarking the [glossary of technical terms](http://staffweb.hkbu.edu.hk/ppp/ksp1/KSPglos.html) and the page on [Kant’s 6 object terms](http://staffweb.hkbu.edu.hk/ppp/ksp1/KSP6.html).

	Enjoy Kant, either way! It’s my strongly held belief that Hegel and Schopy agreed with him basically 100% on the stuff in the first critique, at least on the approach and general findings. Hell, while I’m thinking about it, Schopenhauer’s *Fourfold Root of Sufficient Reason* is a great summary in and of itself of Kant’s first critique.

		I love the enthusiasm, it’s always contagious. Since you used this during a class, how do you recommend applying the literature to the text? Is it best to read them
		simultaneously or go through the secondary as an introduction? I don’t have any academic experience or know how these things generally work so sorry if that’s daft to ask but I’d appreciate knowing how you did it.

		* 🟧 **[Ultimarr](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ultimarr)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-27 01:31:03)_

			Hmm, great question. Personally the hardest part is staying motivated and focused in the first place, so I would recommend getting all the resources you want together then trying them out until you find a flow that you like the best. Personally, I like to follow tertiary sources for quite a while (https://plato.stanford.edu, https://iep.utm.edu, even Wikipedia is shockingly good for popular anglophones), and then go straight to primary sources when I’ve found relevant tidbits to my personal philosophical projects/goals. 
			
			For this specifically I definitely recommend starting with the online textbook, but I’m also *super* biased towards it by its very graphical cognitive-science approach. So take that with a grain of salt! Kant is definitely readable without commentary if you’re patient and maybe jot down some notes on recurring elements, so don’t feel afraid to start right in, either. It’s very long and has lots of different content in it because he was perfecting it for a decade or something crazy like that. 
			
			For epistemology stuff (which IMO is mostly what built toward Hegel, and thus Marx), I would focus on: A) Part I up to Book I Section III, B) the schematism chapter, and C) the architectonic chapter. The rest of the book has a lot of polemics and metaphysical implications, which doesn’t interest me but might interest you depending on why you like Marx!

		That’s a terrible introduction to Kant. Great book, but it assumes you already have some background, and it’s a very unorthodox reading (meaning that it won’t prepare you for how anyone uses Kant other than Deleuze).

			And maybe here is why?
			
			
			“I saw myself as taking an author from behind and giving him a child that would be his own offspring, yet monstrous. It was really important for it to be his own child, because the author had to actually say all I had him saying. But the child was bound to be monstrous too, because it resulted from all sorts of shifting, slipping, dislocations and hidden emissions that I really enjoyed.”
			
			Giles Deleuze

			* 🟦 **[thefleshisaprison](https://www.reddit.com/user/thefleshisaprison)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-27 10:54:56)_

				Yeah, that’s true of all of his readings of philosophers to varying extents (much more noticeable with Bergson than Spinoza, for example).
				
				Kant is in a bit of a weird place with regard to that because Deleuze isn’t making some sort of monster baby. Instead, he’s really trying to figure out how Kant works from the inside. What is unorthodox is less the details of how he understands Kantian concepts; rather, what makes it unorthodox is the fact that he’s really emphasizing the way the Critiques work together rather than focusing on the morality, epistemology, or metaphysics (as people tend to).

		I'm not sure I follow. Most or all of the Greek philosophers were racist and slave owners?

		* 🟧 **[Ok_Rest5521](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Rest5521)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-26 03:39:25)_

			Slave owners, yes. We can not call them racist, in a proper way, because racism as we know it is a modern construct - and I'm thinking with Achile Mbembe here - after the 15th century with the Navigations and the transatlantic slavery of Africans to the Americas. 
			
			In the time period of Greek philosophers, "race", or skin color, was not the factor to determinate slavery. Most slaves came from conquered land and lost battles, irregardless of ethnicity.

			* 🟦 **[jliat](https://www.reddit.com/user/jliat)** ⬆️ 0 _(2024-04-26 03:48:47)_

				* 🟪 **[Ok_Rest5521](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Rest5521)** ⬆️ 7 _(2024-04-26 04:01:56)_

					No. I'm saying: One thing is Eurasians battling Eurasians in Eurasian territory with the goal of conquering land. The slaves were strangers or foreigners, even if they were of the same phenotype.
					
					Other thing is Europeans capturing Africans in African territory for profit *because* they were Africans, from the 15th century onwards. In this case, the phenotype was the only criteria for slavery.
					
					Edit: Adding, "Greek" was not an identity back then. There were from Sparta, Athens, Crete, etc.

						I thought the 15thC Europeans were using an already existing slave trade?
						
						Re Sparta etc. Sure - but the wiki mentions 'foreigners' as slaves.
						
						But the point is that Plato and Aristotle had slaves.

							They are actually correct about this point. Slavery in the ancient world was very different and could not properly be called racist.
							
							Greek and Roman slaves were taken as the plunder of War, or else they were captured and sold by pirates. Additionally, my understanding is that Friedman were at least somewhat common in ancient Greece and Rome, but I'm not an expert.
							
							While people have always noticed phenotypic differences between populations, race as the modern concept only comes into being with modern science. As far as I understand, before that, the word "race" meant something like "nation."

							They were using an already existing trade. One where Africans captured Africans (same phenotype, race not a criteria), to sell them mostly to the Arab world (which already had slaves of their same phenotype in Asia, race not a criteria).
							
							What was new in the 15th century was phenotype becoming the only criteria. There were no European slaves at the time when African slaves where being sold in the Americas. Only Africans, because they were Africans and a specific phenotype. 
							
							Also, foreigners in the Greek world mostly had the same phenotype, race was not the criteria, "alienness" was.
							
							Plato and Arisrotle surely had slaves, but they were not captired and chosen by the difference in the color of their skin or other physical features. This is a modern "invention", after the invasion of the New World.

								But skin color is just an accidential attribute of these slaves. I don't understand the fixation on skin color.
								
								Africans basically enslaved themself and sold their own people to the white man - and now white people get the exclusive blame for the existence of the whole historical constellation. It's incoherent to me.

									By your reply, I am absolutelly sure of it is incoherenr to you, no doubt about that.

										Where is the evidence that white europeans bought and enslaved africans ONLY BECAUSE OF their skin color? How do you single out this specific motive from a lot of possible motives?
										
										Africans did have had a slave trade, enslaved their own people, sold them to Arabs and Whites, but Whites are the one that gets the whole blame for it all.
										
										That's absurd.
										
										This way of thinking - setting up the white man as the mythical enemy - could be a shame-based compensation for the hurtful truth that Africans enslaved themself long time before a white man set his foot on the african continent. Africa wasnt exactly utopia before it got colonized.

			Not a "direct" line, but of course one of the lines of thought that sprouted from Idealism influenced the history of past centuries, and had a climax in the 20th century. For good or bad. Marx is another "branch" of Idealist root, growing in the opposite side of Nazism. And I do not think in compartiments like you suggested, because I believe history, philosophy, narrative, politics all inform each other simultaneously.

	I took an entire course on this as an undergraduate at the University of Virginia. I’m pretty sure it can be distilled down to a priori versus a posteriori knowledge and time and space and are the manifold (the matrix) of the entire universe.
