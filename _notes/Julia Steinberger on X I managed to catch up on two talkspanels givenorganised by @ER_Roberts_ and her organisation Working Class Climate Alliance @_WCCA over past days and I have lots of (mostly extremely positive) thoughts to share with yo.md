I managed to catch up on two talks/panels given/organised by

and her organisation Working Class Climate Alliance

over past days and I have lots of (mostly extremely positive) thoughts to share with you all. A . 1/

Please watch both, they are well worth it. What follows are just my additional thoughts and notes. To start with, I am a middle class twit and very clueless about class in exactly the ways that Emma explains are so harmful, so I learned a lot, and found lots to think about. 3/

If you're on twitter and follow me, chances are you might be in the same boat, so I really recommend to take the opportunity to listen and learn more. The first thing I learned is that indeed class is NOT just an income gradient or a labour relation. Class is much more. 4/

It's about power, it's about dignity, it's about culture, it's about fundamental life chances and conditions. What struck me most was when Emma explained that working class people experience degradation and dismissive attitudes in their daily lives of work, at the hand of ... 5/

middle classes, and hence don't want to spend their precious time outside that experiencing the same in leftist or environmental movements. That working class people want to socialise and organise in spaces that respect their dignity & contributions. 6/

\[darn. just realising this is going to be a long thread. Crap. Sorry. Worth it.\] 7/

Michael Albert, in the 2nd talk, went even further, and explained that working class (WC) people have even MORE antagonism against the "coordinator" or "professional/managerial" class (that middle class people belong to) than to upper classes. And that this makes sense. 8/

Because the WC know and understand the upper classes to be predatory & exploitative. That's normal. But the "coordinator" class betray them by ... coordinating the exploitation. And having conditions of work that are in MA's words "empowering", involving skills & thought. 9/

All of this is news to me but also makes total sense.Another critique of Emma and several speakers was that middle class environmentalism is rooted, or at least expressed, in guilt, resulting in consumer-oriented "voluntary simplicity" exhortations. \[Note: I was never a fan.\] 10/

This creates multiple problems: it lets producers and investors off the hook, it antagonises those that never had enough to start with, and it creates problems for that self-same middle class when they try to interact with anyone else. 11/

This is where I have to come to my own mea culpa, which is going to take a little while, sorry. I have had a few 'working class' experience, summer jobs as a janitor aide, supermarket worker and machinist aide. I am beyond thankful for these experiences, without which ... 12/

I would be even \*more\* of a middle class twit. Despite these experiences, I never fully grasped what Emma talks about so clearly, that working classes have their own culture, their own aspirations, their own dignity, their own modes of creativity and organising. 13/

I basically thought that class was a continuum of income and job coolness, where it was unfair but clear that the more money one made, the more flexible and interesting ones' work became (Michael Albert's "empowering" conditions). And that the ambition of working class ppl... 14/

was to make more $$ & have better working conditions, both of which I thoroughly agreed with and supported. Btw, I spent as much time as I could wrangle on picket lines with striking workers during my PhD days, so this is not just idle talk. Many good memories, not many wins. 15/

But through all of it, I kept my useless middle (coordinator) class guilt. The same guilt that makes it so difficult to talk to working class people about climate and left-environmentalism. Because I assumed FOR THEM that all they wanted was more $$, more of the pie. 16/

But that is a paternalising & patronising oversimplification. By assuming that working class people have grievances (true) but that these grievances centre around consumer culture, and the universal desire for status goods (big cars, long haul flights, fast fashion ...) 17/

we are actually projecting our OWN culture and assumptions, or even worse, the culture of the owner-investor class, onto working class people, and that is uncool, to put it mildly. This was probably my biggest a-ha moment, as Emma and Payal were talking. 18/

That we should be talking with and listening to each other. What do WC people really want? According to Emma, it is much more about dignity, autonomy, POWER SHARING, emancipation, economic security, than consumerism. 19/

So one way to stop being a middle class twit is to stop guiltily assuming that all working class people want is more of the crap (whose production we help coordinate, btw), and start treating them as equal partners in freely debating a very different common future. 20/

Another point I thought was super important, from Emma, was that WC culture, at least in some iterations (everyone was at great pains to avoid treating WC as monolith, lots of variations based on geography, race, gender, sexual orientation, migration, disability, and ...) 21/
