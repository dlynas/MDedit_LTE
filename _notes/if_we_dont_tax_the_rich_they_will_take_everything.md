	The depressing part is that the rich are fully aware of all of this and they are doing their best to stop the people from uniting. And it's working. To quote Warren Buffett : “There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”

			Yup. Racism, Sexism, Transgender stuff, Generational Strife, Border bullshit, Israel Palestine; it's all amped up to make us distracted that all the wealth keeps funneling upwards.
			
			It's intended for everyone to build their identity around this stuff. People who take issue with wealth inequity are funnelled down the communism rabbit hole so they sound  'illegitimate"
			
			Billionaires should pay tax and useful jobs should be paid more.

		I feel like a an overlooked strategy is to tax the rich without demonizing them for being rich and treating them like they are performing a doing a public good and helping others with their wealth. Sure some rich people have made their wealth from being exploitative and those people should be scrutinized, but what about those that became rich by hard work and/or by taking care of their workers? I just feel like we are going about it the wrong way by being like “hey f**k you for being rich”  and we should be like: “hey you are in a position to help other people in a way that none of us are, you can really make a difference in this world, can we count on you to be a force for positive change?” I know the temptation is strong to assume ALL rich folks are unwilling to help and I know I may get eaten alive for this comment but I’m just  just trying to spitball a new way of looking at this problem.

			You also have to figure out the goal:   if you want to tax them high enough so they are no longer rich, they will stop producing that tax revenue.  If you want the tax revenue, you need to tax them at a rate where they still produce that income you want.

			Nobody has **ever** got stupidly rich from being really nice and fair. These guys are then advised on how to be inhuman with their wealth once they become rich. That's to say that they're told to be pricks because that's how they stay rich. "Move your money to this country", "If inflation is %2 then give raises of %1", "You're the ultimate insider since you own the company. Make use of that knowledge."
			
			What that means is that you're not really trying to convince just the super rich: you **have to** legislate fairness because there's a system set up that forces them to be selfish even if they're not naturally inclined to be that way.

		What they also don’t tell you is that just saying “tax the rich” is also just a fucking opp to make you think you have the power to change anything.   News flash,  no matter who you vote
		For, no one’s ever going to tax the rich enough for it to matter.  And it’s not just the billionaires it’s the millionaires too who are, as he said, taking everything.    We need a real class uprising, not some corny campaign  to get out and vote or a dopey protest.   I mean some real actual revolution shit.

		There is no scientifcy prove that keeping tax low actually improves over all quality of life.

		It’s accelrationism. They are knowingly disconnected, living on a different planet than normal humans and workers. 
		
		By inducing human accelerationism the ultra rich would turn those “workers” they are detached from into nothing but *literal* cogs, whose well-being *means nothing*, or *is beside the point*. 
		
		All human resource, energy, labor would put toward technological progression, at ALL costs of general meaning and quality of the average human life. 
		
		The state of living for those laboring would be *only* as passable as *absolutely* necessary to literally keep them alive and producing/laboring— “If they die, and it helps the few of who matter progress, they die. So be it.” Would be the bezos/musk outlook.

		Who services the robots or makes the products they buy with their wealth? 
		
		Do other billionaires still run companies making things but it’s just a robot labor force? So the billionaires all make products for other billionaires to buy? They are all making products for each other? What do those cost when there are only a handful of buyers? They aren’t making them for non wealthy because those folks don’t have money.
		
		Do all of the wealthy become kings and they rule over society with a robot army? Do these wealthy take over the government?
		
		The robots become the police state and are more powerful than the military? Or the governments and their robot military are cahoots with the wealthy and their private robot armies? Or do they fight it out first?

			Makes me imagine a sci-fi dystopian timeline. 
			
			I imagine it would happen slowly. 
			
			More and more jobs get automated, less and less salaries need to be paid, more and more revenue pocketed by shareholders. 
			
			Unemployment creeps up, more social unrest, those who still have their jobs think it won’t happen to them so they will continue to be indifferent. Like the saying about frogs in a boiling pot. 
			
			Unemployment reaches record levels. 30-50% of jobs replaced by automation. A destitute underclass forms. Riots are common place, but the police and military are in the shrinking “employed” class and dare not disobey orders. 
			
			The problem gets more severe, shanty towns house the jobless who barely scrape by from whatever underground or menial jobs they can perform for the employed class. Opportunities become scarce. Work for the government or work for the rich doing physical work that still can’t be automated. Otherwise scrape by with whatever black market opportunity you can find.
			
			Automation increases, Only those who own corporate shares have any sort of significant income anymore as goods are traded mainly between the owning class. 
			
			It gets worse before it eventually gets “better”, the population shoots down as society no longer needs them to operate and leaves them by the wayside. Eventually however with enough automation scarcity is no longer a thing.
			
			There is an ultra rich post scarcity class who own the factories, machines and ai that produce all of the good in society. They will have automated security forces to maintain their position of power.
			
			Now in this post scarcity world they no longer sell goods for money but rather provide them for free in exchange for power. All you can own is what is given to you by the owning class. Upwards mobility no longer exists. You will be provided a decent life so long as you obey. 
			
			
			/end of my fiction 
			
			Alternate option: boiling point forces us to heavily tax any automated work to provide universal basic income to those who get replaced.

			You're asking a lot of questions, so I'll engage with as many as I can. These are purely speculative answers on my part.
			
			
			"How are they rich in that scenario where there is no longer consumers to buy their products or participate in an economy?"
			
			
			An economy is just a collection of transactions and exchanges. If a small few control all the capital, the economy will morph to fit their desires. There doesn't need to be distributed buying power for an economy to function. It just does that way right because capital has traditionally been distributed across the population. In the extreme, if the world were completely automated and 10 people "owned" everything, the system would produce whatever those people wanted at whatever price they agreed between each other.
			
			
			"Who services the robots...?"
			
			
			In a post AGI world, there's no reason the robots can't service themselves. You service yourself as an intelligent human.
			
			
			"Do billionaires still run companies...?"
			
			
			Yes to all questions in this bunch.
			
			
			"Do they become kings...?"
			
			
			This is a semantic question which nobody has an answer to yet. What that looks like exactly nobody knows. But fundamentally a government is just a shared entity that looks after the collective interest of those with power and influence. Historically, when economic power was distributed throughout the population, democracy was the most efficient system to maximize collective economic output. As power becomes more and more concentrated, I assume governmental influence and control will also become more concentrated.
			
			
			"The robots become the police state...?"
			
			
			Yes, controlled by a few with money. But anybody that's studied AI at all will wonder how long that system will last. Once superAGI enters the game, I'm not sure why it would remain under the control of those humans with power. However, it's worth mentioning that none of my hypothetical answers above require humans to be the ones with the power. Any intelligent agent can (and likely will eventually) become the one with power driving the show.
			
			
			Everything I've said is extremely pessimistic and speculative. I hope to be wrong on everything, but these are the answers that come to mind when you and others ask the questions you did.

		I'm going to assume you are an american. Since america's inception, those rich white men made sure to craft a country that would uphold and protect their interests over all. This is foundational.   
		America will never give a damn about the working class or poor. It will bleed them because that is what america is.... to find a new resource and commodify it, squeeze it for all its worth and then move on. And now the last resource is us. If you ran a slaughterhouse, would you give the animals you were about to turn into product more rights?

	Biggest problem right now is that with the modern tech, those in power have the best tools they ever had to evaluate the mood, and divide us.

	Say, 200 years ago, it was incredibly easy for a wealthy person to miss or misread the signs. And the next thing they know, peasants kick their door down and drag them outside and string them up in front of their family, and that's that.

	But now? Privacy doesn't really exist. I'm already on camera literally the moment I open my door, even before I set foot outside. Everything is tracked. Social media is tracked. The shopping algorithms know me better than I know myself. It is incredibly easy to evaluate the peoples' mood now. So when peasants start to get unruly, this buildup is detected and pinpointed before it can build momentum. There's also a constant onslaught of divisive messages and misinformation. Like look, it's them illegal immigrants stealing your jobs! When in reality the business owners voluntarily moved those jobs out of the country to get the same work done for pennies on a dollar in Bangladesh or wherever. While we're arguing over where the 0.1% of the population that is visibly trans can or cannot pee, we're being robbed blind. We don't have the tools to unite, but those in power have an absurd amount of tools and access to data they can use to divide us over a myriad of bullshit issues. As long as we're busy fighting each other, we're alone, and can be fleeced.

	What's worse, again, 200 years ago some peasants with pitchforks were a force to be reckoned with. When things boiled over, they boiled over. Today, that's not a thing any more. We have drones, etc. Did you guys know Samsung doesn't just make phones, they make everything from tanks to automated sentry turrets. Peasants with pitchforks won't even scratch that. Peasants with pitchforks (AR-15s) will die to things they never even saw, striking them from outside of visual range, or from beyond the horizon. A drone cruising 8-15km up and not even visible can flatten a city block. Peasants with pitchforks aren't a threat any more.

	I think this is incredibly interesting because he seems uniquely placed to have very educated views on this subject from a multitude of angles.

	He grew up quite poor but through him being very good at maths he went to one of the top economic schools, London School of Economics. He got a job as a trader earning millions where most of his success was based around bets he placed by understanding wealth inequality.

	With that deep understanding he feels things are tipping in one direction and the path looks very bleak if we allow it to continue.

	How about we start by cutting out all the loopholes and cuts and breaks for taxes? Y'know, the ones that were put in place by all the politicians that also benefit from them? 

	The rich are already taxed, but they legally skirt a lot of taxes, so the rest of that tax burden is placed on the middle and lower class, but the lower class gets breaks of their own so even more falls on the middle class. 

	The problem won't be fixed by applying more taxes to the rich, there are so many different ways for them to legally avoid paying taxes that it would make no difference in the end. The problem *could* be solved by just having a set percentage of taxes, no breaks, no cuts, no deductions, just a flat percentage that everyone pays, individuals and businesses alike. One fixed amount for federal, another for state, each state can pick their own percentage. But tromping around all high and mighty and pompous saying " just tax the rich, that'll solve all the issues!" is an incredibly stupid, arrogant, and naïve thing to do and believe.

	These guys pop up every now and then speaking the truth. The problem is that they all don’t pop up at the same time. Us comfortable people thinking it’s not worth the time to fight don’t hear it consistently enough to actually create a change in our world. It gets washed out until someone does something to prove it’s work making a change. Until then, it’s just words in everyone’s eyes.

	Yeah I know the rich got us, we're fucked, and the environment is fucked and there are school shootings and the justice system is fucked and human rights are going backwards and a bunch of other things. I vote and pay taxes but it doesn't matter, so I'm going back to looking at memes and playing video games.

	It’s the oldest trick in the book, divide and conquer, let the poor fight for crumbs and go to war, anyone who disapproves is a traitor. It’s really in our face in the US but so many millions are encouraging a downfall in democracy and freedoms. It’s getting sad and weird, people don’t want to pay taxes but hand over cash so the heathens don’t get any handouts. Just tax the billionaires and churches, they’re parasites.

	One thing that gets overlooked is that taxes on corporations and wealth encourage spending over hoarding. If the holders of the wealth face higher taxes, they will use that capital to lower that burden instead of sitting on it like a dragon.

	One of the biggest issues impacting this, is the legalisation of bribery in the US through corporate lobbying. 

	The advent of the digital age handed the super rich an apparatus that has enabled them to double down on systems and processes that make them richer at the expense of everything else, whilst making it mechanically impossible to challenge this.

	The only means through which to mitigate, constrain and harness corporate excess for the betterment of all is effective government and governance.

	Lobbying enables corporate interests to threaten elected officials with oblesecence by withholding campaign funds if they don't act in the lobby's interest. Localised lobbying has created a political system in the US in which senators/congressmen are elected and retained based on how many jobs they bring in, and how effectively they manipulate their election/retainment campaign. 

	This system suits the super rich, who are building their fortunes from short term prospecting, because it enables the corporate apparatus to fully subvert the systems of governance designed in principal to control it. 

	Meanwhile the US population tears itself apart over Big vs Small government, which has become a contrived issue to distract from the real problem: a lack of effective government, be it an IRS that is upgunned and re focused on the rich instead of salvaging the struggling middle classes, or an aggressive federal push to punish corporate entities engaged in illegal and harmful activities instead of protecting them because 'jobs'.

	Propping up all of this is a Reagnanite religion lionising unrestricted vulture capitalism, pushed hard by the Chicago school of Economics and reinforced in the media by corporate entities that need this to be status quo to shamelessly generate wealth at the expense of capital, fulfilling the requirement of their shareholders.

	This suits the 0.1%, and whilst they didn't invent it in a machiavellian conspiracy, they certainly -whether consciously or inadvertently through their wealth apparatus- reinforce this 'truth' as Truth.

	The market is not a self aware God, it is a hetergenous spreadsheet macro operating at close to the speed of light designed for one purpose: make as much money right now regardless of long term consequences so that capital can be transitioned to wealth for the small number of invested partners.

	People in the US often equate socialism with Evil, where as in Norway and Sweden social democracy minimises the wealth divide, provides prosperity for all whilst enabling individuals to accrue capital through innovation. Most US citizens are lobsters put in a cold pot that's about to boil over, pushing the believe button and refusing to see the abuse they suffer systematically is anything but a cynical means through which to harvest the sweat of their brow for someone else to have another investment opportunity.

	The Culture War and polarisation distracts from the mechanics of coercion and control we are victims of. All issues that affect the US role downhill and impact the rest of the world.

	There can be no improvement without cutting off the Macros voice; amend the constitution to ban all corporate lobbying beyond very strict parameters and restrict campaign spending to $50k per candidate for any senatorial or congressional race, with harsh measure in place to restrict breaking this system. That's a start; without removing the bribery nothing else is achievable.

	In the meantime demonising socialism as a necessary (and aspirational) element of capitalism, in a country in which Richard Nixon was a hairs breadth from implementing universal based income(!), only benefits the people who are manipulating, whether deliberately or incidentally.

	Just so everyone knows…this guy has made millions trading on the London exchange. He is speaking from a position of extreme wealth but touts himself as an economic guru and voice for the underdog. He talks a lot about the banality of rich people, but offers nothing practical to actually implement the re-distribution of wealth.

	We’re not Americans I don’t care who they have to choose from. I care about the Uk, more specifically I care about my local area. 

	Like I’ve said, don’t vote for the party you like, know you local politicians. Listen to what they suggest for your local area and vote accordingly. This is the way politics is supposed to work, not whether or not you like Rishi Sunak.

	He's halfway there. If you took all of the billionaires "worth," add it up. How long would it fund the government? Estimations range from 6 to 9 months. Then what? Yes, there has been a massive wealth transfer, AND our government has a huge spending problem. And WHO donates to the politicians running the government? If you can't see the actual problem and want to be mad at the "other side," there is no hope.
