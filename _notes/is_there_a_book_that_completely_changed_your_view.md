	“Win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie” completely changed how I socialised with people and ultimately did exactly what the title said. 

	“A man’s search for meaning - Victor Frankl” - this book will put into perspective how good your life is and how purpose is easily the most important thing in a man’s life.

		Two classics that will forever stand the test the time. Great selections!
		
		*A Man's Search for Meaning* is as powerful as it gets. For sure it puts your own life into perspective.

	Dune.

	This book helped to start turning my life back around after I developed panic attacks and anxiety. It then progressed and turned into agoraphobia and insomnia, medication was only numbing it and not helping. I couldn't sleep at night and so I started reading Dune and reading this book enabled my mind to turn off from my mental health issues for the first time in two years since it started (that was 5 years ago). 

	Then I read the famous line 'fear is the mindkiller' that whole thing perfectly describes anxiety and how to cope with it. Fear IS the mindkiller when you have mental health issues.

* 🟩 **[Merophe](https://www.reddit.com/user/Merophe)** ⬆️ 15 _(2024-03-27 21:02:19)_

	Got recommended by my therapist, and still on the first quarter of the book. However, it has dramatically changed me who has been living with trauma for years but never aware of it.

	Being in 20s and now the world is full of social anxiety and dating and being alpha and what not... I say "models" by Mark manson COMPLETELY change my outlook on dating, relationships etc. not only it helped me how to talk to people...  Yes I said people because that book is about relationship advice to men but it changed how to see communication as whole to person to person. No BS tricks and techniques in how to get laid. Just some psychology insights and his experiences with women. But it changed my perspective alot.

	I never say this and I just hate the wanna be gurus on social media right now... And they are so many but I think especially for gen z mark manson right now is closest to giving you really good advice about improving your life in every aspect.

	There is a book that changed my life! I'm not the type of person who says that kind of thing very often, but it's true: "Learned Optimism," by Martin Seligman. The 3 Ps! 

	I can honestly divide my life into "before that book" and "after that book." 

	I'm at work and I need to leave to catch my train, but... well, look it up. It's tremendous, and it kicked off the whole "Positive Psychology" kick we saw about 15 years ago.

	I have a few (yes I’m breaking the rule of only 1):

	1. Who Moved My Cheese by Dr. Spencer Johnson - it’s about change being inevitable but how we deal with it shapes our life. It helped me to realize how much our reaction to change really does impact our lives. It gave me motivation to change how I was reacting to certain situations at that time in my life. 

	2. The Radical Awakening by Dr. Shefali - it focuses on teaching women how to harness their power by letting go of what society has said we should be. This book has been eye opening especially coming from a toxic marriage. It helped me understand myself as a mother. Helped me understand my own mother more. I also connected deeply with how much pressure the patriarch and society as a whole has put on women. I don’t think I’ve ever underlined and noted so many items while reading a book.   

	3. The Giver by Lois Lowry - This is a classic. I read it the first time as a young teen. It really drove home how boring life would be if we were all the same, never allowed to imagine and dream or have emotions. Humans aren’t meant to be robotic.

	Atomic Habits. I was already deep into trying to change my habits one piece at a time, so it wasn't that big of a perspective change, but it really helped me increase efficiency with my habit changes.

	Rich Dad Poor Dad. Gave me a new perspective on how capitalism works. I'm too deep in the 'rat race' to really be able to do anything big with the knowledge, but the perspective it gave me follows me daily. 

	Indistractable. Basically helped me realize how distracted I was and gave me good ways to improve. I am a completely different person today from various changes to my environment (mostly various phone and laptop settings) that means I get to focus more when I work.

	Dune. Didn't like it by page 150, and it pretty much taught me that reading through the remaining 900 pages will not make me like it more. I no longer need to read all chapters of a book to be finished reading it.

	I want to say "Ultra-Processed People", but I'm currently reading that, so I can't really tell how it'll stand up over time as a perspective shifter. I've read a lot of books that I thought were perspective changers at the time of reading them, but looking back, those changes were not significant, or just didn't stick around.

	The book changed my Perception of how to use money to get more money, instead of not letting it work, as a concept.

	The book is imo very overhyped, because not all the examples in the book actually happened and it was made up, but it did tell the concepts nicely.

	Using money to get assets instead of liabilities, its amazing.

The book talks about common (and serious) misconceptions mostly westerners (me included) have about the world, and tries to change that view with a more realistic and suprisingly very positive view, all backed up by measureable numbers. Also talks about how data can be presented in a way that it suggests a wrong conclusion for example

	After years and years of owning it, and really only reading the beginning and the end of it out of mild curiosity... once I really sat down with it:

	The Bible.

	Ever since it's probably been the most influential book I've ever read. I still get a lot of good stuff out of it. I see why it's been a "best-seller" since.. well, since books were printed.

	Not here to convert anyone, what you do with it is up to you. S'just my two cents.

		Can't argue with you on that. There's a reason it's the number one all time best seller. It's gotta be providing some kind of value to people's lives.

		I'm just an atheist who fucks w some cultural anthropology heavy and even I love the Bible. Absolutely brilliant. Completely fascinating. So illustrative of the human struggle and our attempt to transcend it. It's just fucking cool as hell in its own right. I had to completely forget all the dogma and fundamentalism that other people bring it down with but once it clicked it's one of my favorites.

			Mad respect for ya.
			
			As a Christian I spend a lot of time investigating other philosophies and religions. I'd've gone to higher schooling for philosophy if I thought I could find a decent job with it. Alaa, I did not. Still probably one My all-time favorite fields of academia.
			
			..actually it probably is my favorite. I love CompSci, science in general, and psychology a lot too but the all the different philosophies and histories/myths really grab my attention

	Zen by Shunmyo Masuno. It's a self help book but it's the only one I will vouch for. My perception of other people's way of thinking changed, my own way of handling things changed. You will feel like you are in a garden, with calmness surrounding you.

	Never. I've always thought that if any book can change your full perspective of life, then you aren't being critical enough. I can understand that there will be some interesting points and things to learn but only that. 

	Or may be your life philosophy, foundations (or whichever you want to call it) were not solid enough.

		I like this answer alot and I agree to an extent. I still think there are circumstances where a book can completely transform ones ideologies. It's good to be firm in your stances, philosophy, or whatever else along those lines, but I don't think anyone should ever be so rigid that they aren't open to new ideas. And I definitely think there are books out out there with ideas powerful enough to transform just about anyone. But let me go a bit further on that, a book can only provide the info/idea, a person will need that said idea/belief to be confirmed in their actual life (living proof) for it to be truly adopted.

			This goes perfectly with my choice! 'Outlines of Pyrrhonism' by Sextus Empiricus. There are 10 modes to Pyrrhonism and they all relate to being able to assume what could be true, but because of this or that, none of us can know absolute truths. It isn't too long of a read. I recommend reading the 10 modes, or arguments, at least.
