## Palestine Action’s direct action campaign has forced the logistics giant, Kuehne + Nagel, to drop all ties with Elbit Systems.

This was won by actionists shattering their sites in Leicester, London and Milton Keynes - where they also left messages calling for the transportation company to “cut ties with Elbit” and “WE WILL WIN”.

This victory makes the transportation company the fourth firm to drop all ties with Elbit after similar actions were taken against them.

Each company wrote to us to confirm the news and asked us to cease the campaign against them, essentially admitting to the reason behind their decision to cut Elbit. 

These results make it harder for Elbit to find the suppliers, transporters, property managers and other services they need to continue their genocide operations. 

One by one, all those who enable Elbit will fall and WE WILL WIN. 

To take similar action against those who are still linked with Elbit check out elbitsites.uk and our guide on taking covert action at palestineaction.org/pal_manual_2
