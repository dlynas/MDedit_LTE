South Africa is a [biodiversity hotspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_hotspot "Biodiversity hotspot"), with unique [biomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomes "Biomes"), plant and animal life. With over [62 million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Africa "Demographics of South Africa"), the country is the world's [23rd-most populous nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population "List of countries and dependencies by population") and covers an area of 1,221,037 square kilometres (471,445 square miles). [Pretoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria "Pretoria") is the administrative capital, while [Cape Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town "Cape Town"), as the seat of Parliament, is the legislative capital. [Bloemfontein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloemfontein "Bloemfontein") has traditionally been regarded as the judicial capital.<sup id="cite_ref-Marais_Twala_2020_pp._49–62_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Marais_Twala_2020_pp._49%E2%80%9362-21">[21]</a></sup> The [Constitutional Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_South_Africa "Constitutional Court of South Africa"), the country's highest court, is located in Johannesburg.

About 80% of the population are [Black South Africans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_South_Africa "Ethnic groups in South Africa").<sup id="cite_ref-auto2_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-auto2-6">[6]</a></sup> The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European ([White South Africans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_South_Africans "White South Africans")), Asian ([Indian South Africans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_South_Africans "Indian South Africans") and [Chinese South Africans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_South_Africans "Chinese South Africans")), and multiracial ([Coloured South Africans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coloureds "Coloureds")) ancestry. South Africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide [variety of cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_South_Africa "Culture of South Africa"), [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_South_Africa "Languages of South Africa"), and [religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_South_Africa "Religion in South Africa"). Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_South_Africa "Constitution of South Africa")'s recognition of 12 official languages, the fourth-highest number in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-safacts_19-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-safacts-19">[19]</a></sup> According to the 2011 census, the two most spoken first languages are [Zulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_language "Zulu language") (22.7%) and [Xhosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhosa_language "Xhosa language") (16.0%).<sup id="cite_ref-cib11_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-cib11-22">[22]</a></sup> The next two are of European origin: [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans "Afrikaans") (13.5%) developed from [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language") and serves as the first language of most Coloured and White South Africans; [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_English "South African English") (9.6%) is commonly used in public and commercial life, both reflecting the legacy of Dutch and British colonialism, respectively.

[Regular elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_South_Africa "Elections in South Africa") have been held for almost a century in the country. However, the vast majority of Black South Africans were not [enfranchised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage "Suffrage") until [1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_South_African_general_election "1994 South African general election"). During the 20th century, the black majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority, which played a large role in the country's recent [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_South_Africa "History of South Africa") and politics. The [National Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_(South_Africa) "National Party (South Africa)") imposed [apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid "Apartheid") in 1948, institutionalising previous [racial segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation "Racial segregation"). After a [largely non-violent struggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_resistance_to_apartheid "Internal resistance to apartheid") by the [African National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress "African National Congress") and other anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country, the repeal of discriminatory laws began in the mid-1980s. Since 1994, all ethnic and linguistic groups have held political representation in the country's [liberal democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy "Liberal democracy"), which comprises a [parliamentary republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic "Parliamentary republic") and [nine provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_South_Africa "Provinces of South Africa"). South Africa is often referred to as the "[rainbow nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_nation "Rainbow nation")" to describe the country's multicultural diversity, especially in the wake of apartheid.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> According to the 2023 [V-Dem Democracy indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Dem_Democracy_indices "V-Dem Democracy indices"), South Africa is ranked the 51st electoral democracy worldwide and the 3rd [electoral democracy in Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_Africa "Democracy in Africa").<sup id="cite_ref-vdem_dataset_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-vdem_dataset-24">[24]</a></sup>

## Etymology

The name "South Africa" is derived from the country's geographic location at the southern tip of Africa. Upon formation, the country was named the [Union of South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa "Union of South Africa") in English and _Unie van Zuid-Afrika_ in [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language "Dutch language"), reflecting its origin from the unification of four British colonies. Since 1961, the long formal name in English has been the "Republic of South Africa" and _Republiek van Suid-Afrika_ in [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans "Afrikaans"). The country has an official name in [12 official languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_South_Africa "Languages of South Africa").<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>

**Mzansi**, derived from the [Xhosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhosa_language "Xhosa language") noun _uMzantsi_ meaning "south", is a [colloquial name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialism "Colloquialism") for South Africa,<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> while some [Pan-Africanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Africanism "Pan-Africanism") political parties prefer the term "[Azania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azania "Azania")".<sup id="cite_ref-Azania_42-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Azania-42">[42]</a></sup>

Settlements of [Bantu-speaking peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_peoples_of_South_Africa "Bantu peoples of South Africa"), who were iron-using agriculturists and [herdsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herder "Herder"), were present south of the [Limpopo River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpopo_River "Limpopo River") (now the northern border with [Botswana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana "Botswana") and [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe "Zimbabwe")) by the 4th or 5th century CE. They displaced, conquered, and absorbed the original [Khoisan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoisan "Khoisan"), [Khoikhoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoekhoe "Khoekhoe") and [San](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_people "San people") peoples. The Bantu slowly moved south. The earliest [ironworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironworks "Ironworks") in modern-day [KwaZulu-Natal Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal "KwaZulu-Natal") are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the [Xhosa people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhosa_people "Xhosa people"), whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan people. The Xhosa reached the [Great Fish River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fish_River "Great Fish River"), in today's Eastern Cape Province. As they migrated, these larger [Iron Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age "Iron Age") populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples.

In 1487, the Portuguese explorer [Bartolomeu Dias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeu_Dias "Bartolomeu Dias") led the first European voyage to land in southern Africa.<sup id="cite_ref-domville-25_52-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-domville-25-52">[52]</a></sup> On 4 December, he landed at Walfisch Bay (now known as [Walvis Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walvis_Bay "Walvis Bay") in present-day Namibia). This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor, the Portuguese navigator [Diogo Cão](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_C%C3%A3o "Diogo Cão") ([Cape Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cross "Cape Cross"), north of the bay). Dias continued down the western coast of southern Africa. After 8 January 1488, prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast, he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it. He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as, what he called, _Rio do Infante_, probably the present-day [Groot River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groot_River_(Eastern_Cape) "Groot River (Eastern Cape)"), in May 1488. On his return he saw the cape, which he named _Cabo das Tormentas_ ('Cape of Storms'). King [John II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II_of_Portugal "John II of Portugal") renamed the point _Cabo da Boa Esperança_, or [Cape of Good Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope "Cape of Good Hope"), as it led to the riches of the [East Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Indies "East Indies").<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> Dias' feat of navigation was immortalised in [Luís de Camões](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu%C3%ADs_de_Cam%C3%B5es "Luís de Camões")' 1572 epic poem _[Os Lusíadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os_Lus%C3%ADadas "Os Lusíadas")_.

By the early 17th century, Portugal's maritime power was starting to decline, and English and Dutch merchants competed to oust Portugal from its lucrative monopoly on the [spice trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_trade "Spice trade").<sup id="cite_ref-Pakeman_54-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Pakeman-54">[54]</a></sup> Representatives of the British [East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company "East India Company") sporadically called at the cape in search of provisions as early as 1601 but later came to favour [Ascension Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_Island "Ascension Island") and [Saint Helena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena "Saint Helena") as alternative ports of refuge.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaap_55-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Kaap-55">[55]</a></sup> Dutch interest was aroused after 1647, when two employees of the [Dutch East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company "Dutch East India Company") were shipwrecked at the cape for several months. The sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaap_55-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Kaap-55">[55]</a></sup> They also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil.<sup id="cite_ref-zastudy_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-zastudy-56">[56]</a></sup> Upon their return to Holland, they reported favourably on the cape's potential as a "warehouse and garden" for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages.<sup id="cite_ref-Kaap_55-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Kaap-55">[55]</a></sup>

The struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between Europeans and the indigenous population and also between the Boers and the British.<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>

1876 map of South Africa

On 16 May 1876, President [Thomas François Burgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Fran%C3%A7ois_Burgers "Thomas François Burgers") of the South African Republic declared war against the [Pedi people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedi_people "Pedi people"). King [Sekhukhune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sekhukhune "Sekhukhune") managed to defeat the army on 1 August 1876. Another attack by the Lydenburg Volunteer Corps was also repulsed. On 16 February 1877, the two parties signed a peace treaty at [Botshabelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botshabelo,_Mpumalanga "Botshabelo, Mpumalanga").<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> The Boers' inability to subdue the Pedi led to the departure of Burgers in favour of [Paul Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kruger "Paul Kruger") and the British annexation of the South African Republic. In 1878 and 1879 three British attacks were successfully repelled until [Garnet Wolseley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garnet_Wolseley,_1st_Viscount_Wolseley "Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley") defeated Sekhukhune in November 1879 with an army of 2,000 British soldiers, Boers and 10,000 Swazis.

The [Anglo-Zulu War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Zulu_War "Anglo-Zulu War") was fought in 1879 between the British and the [Zulu Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_Kingdom "Zulu Kingdom"). Following [Lord Carnarvon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Herbert,_4th_Earl_of_Carnarvon "Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon")'s successful introduction of [federation in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Confederation "Canadian Confederation"), it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa. In 1874, [Henry Bartle Frere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Bartle_Frere "Henry Bartle Frere") was sent to South Africa as the British [High Commissioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner_for_Southern_Africa "High Commissioner for Southern Africa") to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the Boers, and the Zululand army. The Zulu nation defeated the British at the [Battle of Isandlwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Isandlwana "Battle of Isandlwana"). Eventually Zululand lost the war, resulting in the termination of the Zulu nation's independence.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup>

The [Battle of Majuba Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Majuba_Hill "Battle of Majuba Hill") was the last decisive battle during the [First Boer War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Boer_War "First Boer War"), and saw the British defeated by the Boers after 2 hours of fighting.

The Boer republics successfully resisted British encroachments during the [First Boer War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Boer_War "First Boer War") (1880–1881) using [guerrilla warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare "Guerrilla warfare") tactics, which were well-suited to local conditions. The British returned with greater numbers, more experience, and new strategy in the [Second Boer War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War "Second Boer War") (1899–1902) and, although they suffered heavy casualties through [attrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attrition_warfare "Attrition warfare"), they were ultimately successful. Over 27,000 Boer women and children died in the [British concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War_concentration_camps "Second Boer War concentration camps").<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup>

South Africa's urban population grew rapidly from the end of the 19th century onward. After the devastation of the wars, Dutch-descendant Boer farmers fled into cities from the devastated [Transvaal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvaal_Colony "Transvaal Colony") and Orange Free State territories to become the class of the white urban poor.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_72-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-:0-72">[72]</a></sup>

### Independence

Anti-British policies among white South Africans focused on independence. During the Dutch and British colonial years, [racial segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation "Racial segregation") was mostly informal, though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of indigenous people, including the [Native Location Act of 1879](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Location_Act_of_1879 "Native Location Act of 1879") and the system of [pass laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_laws "Pass laws").<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup>

Eight years after the end of the Second Boer War and after four years of negotiation, the [South Africa Act 1909](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_Act_1909 "South Africa Act 1909") granted nominal independence while creating the [Union of South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_Africa "Union of South Africa") on 31 May 1910. The union was a [dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion "Dominion") that included the former territories of the Cape, Transvaal and Natal colonies, as well as the Orange Free State republic.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> The [Natives' Land Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natives_Land_Act,_1913 "Natives Land Act, 1913") of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks; at that stage they controlled only 7% of the country. The amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased.<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup>

In 1931, the union became fully sovereign from the United Kingdom with the passage of the [Statute of Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931 "Statute of Westminster 1931"), which abolished the last powers of the [Parliament of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom "Parliament of the United Kingdom") to legislate in the country. Only three other African countries—Liberia, Ethiopia, and Egypt—had been independent prior to that point. In 1934, the [South African Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Party "South African Party") and [National Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_(South_Africa) "National Party (South Africa)") merged to form the [United Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Party_(South_Africa) "United Party (South Africa)"), seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking whites. In 1939, the party split over the entry of the union into World War II, as an ally of the United Kingdom, a move which National Party followers opposed.<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup>

### Apartheid era

"For use by white persons" – apartheid sign in English and Afrikaans

In 1948, the National Party was elected to power. It strengthened the racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule. Taking Canada's [Indian Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Act "Indian Act") as a framework,<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> the [nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism "Nationalism") government classified all peoples into three races (_Whites, Blacks, Indians and Coloured people (people of mixed race)_) and developed rights and limitations for each. The white minority (less than 20%)<sup id="cite_ref-82"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> controlled the vastly larger black majority. The legally institutionalised segregation became known as _[apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid "Apartheid")_. While whites enjoyed the highest [standard of living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living "Standard of living") in all of Africa, comparable to [First World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World "First World") Western nations, the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy.<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> The [Freedom Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Charter "Freedom Charter"), adopted in 1955 by the [Congress Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_Alliance "Congress Alliance"), demanded a non-racial society and an end to discrimination.

On 31 May 1961, the country became a republic following [a referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_South_African_republic_referendum "1960 South African republic referendum") (only open to white voters) which narrowly passed;<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> the British-dominated Natal province largely voted against the proposal. [Elizabeth II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II "Elizabeth II") lost the title [Queen of South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_South_Africa "Monarchy of South Africa"), and the last [Governor-General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_South_Africa "Governor-General of South Africa"), [Charles Robberts Swart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._R._Swart "C. R. Swart"), became [state president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_President_of_South_Africa "State President of South Africa"). As a concession to the [Westminster system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system "Westminster system"), the appointment of the president remained an appointment by parliament and was virtually powerless until [P. W. Botha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._W._Botha "P. W. Botha")'s [Constitution Act of 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Constitution_of_1983 "South African Constitution of 1983"), which eliminated the office of [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_South_Africa "Prime Minister of South Africa") and instated a unique "strong presidency" [responsible to parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system "Parliamentary system"). Pressured by other [Commonwealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations") countries, South Africa withdrew from the organisation in 1961 and rejoined it in 1994.

Despite [opposition to apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_resistance_to_apartheid "Internal resistance to apartheid") both within and outside the country, the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid. The security forces cracked down on internal dissent, and violence became widespread, with anti-apartheid organisations such as the [African National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress "African National Congress") (ANC), the [Azanian People's Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azanian_People%27s_Organisation "Azanian People's Organisation"), and the [Pan-Africanist Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Africanist_Congress_of_Azania "Pan Africanist Congress of Azania") carrying out guerrilla warfare<sup id="cite_ref-Biko1_85-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Biko1-85">[85]</a></sup> and urban sabotage.<sup id="cite_ref-Switzer_86-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Switzer-86">[86]</a></sup> The three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional inter-factional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence.<sup id="cite_ref-Mitchell_87-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Mitchell-87">[87]</a></sup> Apartheid became increasingly controversial, and several countries began to boycott business with the South African government because of its racial policies. These measures were later extended to international sanctions and the [divestment of holdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinvestment_from_South_Africa "Disinvestment from South Africa") by foreign investors.<sup id="cite_ref-Bridgland_88-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Bridgland-88">[88]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Landgren_89-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Landgren-89">[89]</a></sup>

### Post-apartheid

[F.W. de Klerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._de_Klerk "F. W. de Klerk") and [Nelson Mandela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela "Nelson Mandela") shake hands in January 1992

The [Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahlabatini_Declaration_of_Faith "Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith"), signed by [Mangosuthu Buthelezi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangosuthu_Buthelezi "Mangosuthu Buthelezi") and [Harry Schwarz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Schwarz "Harry Schwarz") in 1974, enshrined the principles of [peaceful transition of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_transition_of_power "Peaceful transition of power") and equality for all, the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa. Ultimately, [F.W. de Klerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._de_Klerk "F. W. de Klerk") opened bilateral discussions with [Nelson Mandela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela "Nelson Mandela") in 1993 for a transition of policies and government.

In 1990, the National Party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the ANC and other political organisations. It released Nelson Mandela from prison after 27 years of serving a sentence for sabotage. A [negotiation process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiations_to_end_apartheid_in_South_Africa "Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa") followed. With approval from the white electorate in a [1992 referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_South_African_apartheid_referendum "1992 South African apartheid referendum"), the government continued negotiations to end apartheid. South Africa held its first universal [elections in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_South_African_general_election "1994 South African general election"), which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since. The country rejoined the [Commonwealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations") and became a member of the [Southern African Development Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_African_Development_Community "Southern African Development Community").<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

In post-apartheid South Africa, unemployment remained high. While many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes, the overall unemployment rate of black people worsened between 1994 and 2003 by official metrics but declined significantly using expanded definitions.<sup id="cite_ref-sach3_91-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-sach3-91">[91]</a></sup> Poverty among whites, which was previously rare, increased.<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup> The government struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth. The United Nations [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index "Human Development Index") rose steadily until the mid-1990s<sup id="cite_ref-93"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> then fell from 1995 to 2005 before recovering its 1995 peak in 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-94"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup> The fall is in large part attributable to the [South African HIV/AIDS pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_South_Africa "HIV/AIDS in South Africa") which saw South African life expectancy fall from a high point of 62 years in 1992 to a low of 53 in 2005,<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> and the failure of the government to take steps to address the pandemic in its early years.<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>

[Satellite image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_image "Satellite image") of South Africa

South Africa is in southernmost Africa, with a coastline that stretches more than 2,500 km (1,553 mi) and along two oceans (the South Atlantic and the Indian). At 1,219,912 km<sup>2</sup> (471,011 sq mi),<sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup> South Africa is the 24th-largest country in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup> Excluding the [Prince Edward Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Islands "Prince Edward Islands"), the country lies between latitudes [22°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/22nd_parallel_south "22nd parallel south") and [35°S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35th_parallel_south "35th parallel south"), and longitudes [16°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_meridian_east "16th meridian east") and [33°E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33rd_meridian_east "33rd meridian east"). The interior of South Africa consists of a large, in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between 1,000 m (3,300 ft) and 2,100 m (6,900 ft), highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north, and slightly so to the south and south-west.<sup id="cite_ref-117"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> This plateau is surrounded by the [Great Escarpment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Escarpment,_Southern_Africa "Great Escarpment, Southern Africa")<sup id="cite_ref-Altas_118-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Altas-118">[118]</a></sup> whose eastern, and highest, stretch is known as the [Drakensberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drakensberg "Drakensberg").<sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> [Mafadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafadi "Mafadi") in the Drakensberg at 3,450 m (11,320 ft) is the highest peak. The KwaZulu-Natal–Lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the Great Escarpment which reaches an altitude of over 3,000 m (9,800 ft).<sup id="cite_ref-120"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup>

The south and south-western parts of the plateau (at approximately 1,100–1,800 m above sea level) and the adjoining plain below (at approximately 700–800 m above sea level – see map on the right) is known as the [Great Karoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoo "Karoo"), which consists of sparsely populated [shrubland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrubland "Shrubland"). To the north, the Great Karoo fades into the more arid Bushmanland, which eventually becomes the [Kalahari Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalahari_Desert "Kalahari Desert") in the north-west of the country. The mid-eastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the [Highveld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highveld "Highveld"). This relatively well-watered area is home to a great proportion of the country's commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation (Gauteng). To the north of Highveld, from about the 25° 30' S line of latitude, the plateau slopes downwards into the [Bushveld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushveld "Bushveld"), which ultimately gives way to the Limpopo River lowlands or [Lowveld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veld#Highveld_and_Lowveld "Veld").<sup id="cite_ref-Altas_118-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Altas-118">[118]</a></sup>

The coastal belt, below the Great Escarpment, moving clockwise from the northeast, consists of the Limpopo Lowveld, which merges into the Mpumalanga Lowveld, below the Mpumalanga Drakensberg (the eastern portion of the Great Escarpment).<sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup> This is hotter, drier and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld above the escarpment.<sup id="cite_ref-Altas_118-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Altas-118">[118]</a></sup> The [Kruger National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruger_National_Park "Kruger National Park"), located in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in north-eastern South Africa, occupies a large portion of the Lowveld covering 19,633 square kilometres (7,580 sq mi)<sup id="cite_ref-Kruger_National_Park_122-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Kruger_National_Park-122">[122]</a></sup>

The coastal belt below the south and south-western stretches of the Great Escarpment contains several ranges of [Cape Fold Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Fold_Belt "Cape Fold Belt") which run parallel to the coast, separating the Great Escarpment from the ocean.<sup id="cite_ref-123"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-geological_map_124-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-geological_map-124">[124]</a></sup> (These parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map, above left. Note the course of the Great Escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges.) The land between the [Outeniqua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outeniqua_Mountains "Outeniqua Mountains") and [Langeberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langeberg "Langeberg") ranges to the south and the [Swartberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swartberg "Swartberg") range to the north is known as the [Little Karoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoo "Karoo"),<sup id="cite_ref-Altas_118-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Altas-118">[118]</a></sup> which consists of semi-desert shrubland similar to that of the Great Karoo, except that its northern strip along the foothills of the Swartberg Mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is, therefore, more cultivated than the Great Karoo. The Little Karoo is famous for its ostrich farming around [Oudtshoorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oudtshoorn "Oudtshoorn"). The lowland area to the north of the Swartberg range up to the Great Escarpment is the lowland part of the Great Karoo, which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the Karoo above the Great Escarpment. The narrow coastal strip between the Outeniqua and Langeberg ranges and the ocean has a moderately high year-round rainfall, which is known as the [Garden Route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Route "Garden Route"). It is famous for the most extensive areas of forests in South Africa (a generally forest-poor country).

In the south-west corner of the country, the [Cape Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Peninsula "Cape Peninsula") forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the Atlantic Ocean and ultimately terminates at the country's border with Namibia at the [Orange River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_River "Orange River"). The Cape Peninsula has a [Mediterranean climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate "Mediterranean climate"), making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of [Sub-Saharan Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa "Sub-Saharan Africa") which receives most of its rainfall in winter.<sup id="cite_ref-125"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Altas1_126-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Altas1-126">[126]</a></sup> The coastal belt to the north of the Cape Peninsula is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean and the first row of north–south running Cape Fold Mountains to the east. The Cape Fold Mountains peter out at about the 32° S line of latitude,<sup id="cite_ref-geological_map_124-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-geological_map-124">[124]</a></sup> after which the Great Escarpment bounds the coastal plain. The most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the [Swartland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swartland "Swartland") and Malmesbury Plain, which is an important wheat growing region, relying on winter rains. The region further north is known as [Namaqualand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namaqualand "Namaqualand"),<sup id="cite_ref-127"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup> which becomes more arid near the Orange River. The little rain that falls tends to fall in winter,<sup id="cite_ref-Altas1_126-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Altas1-126">[126]</a></sup> which results in one of the world's most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of [veld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veld "Veld") in spring (August–September).

South Africa also has one offshore possession, the small [sub-Antarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic "Subantarctic") [archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago "Archipelago") of the Prince Edward Islands, consisting of [Marion Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Island "Marion Island") (290 km<sup>2</sup> or 110 sq mi) and Prince Edward Island (45 km<sup>2</sup> or 17 sq mi) (not to be confused with the [Canadian province of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island "Prince Edward Island")).

### Climate

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/South_Africa_K%C3%B6ppen.svg/220px-South_Africa_K%C3%B6ppen.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:South_Africa_K%C3%B6ppen.svg)

[Köppen climate types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification "Köppen climate classification") of South Africa

South Africa has a generally [temperate climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate "Temperate climate") because it is surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, because it is located in the climatically milder [Southern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere "Southern Hemisphere"), and because its average elevation rises steadily toward the north (toward the equator) and further inland. This varied topography and oceanic influence result in a great variety of climatic zones. The climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern [Namib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namib "Namib") in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with Mozambique and the Indian Ocean. Winters in South Africa occur between June and August. The extreme southwest has a climate similar to that of the [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate "Mediterranean climate") with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous [fynbos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fynbos "Fynbos") [biome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome "Biome") of shrubland and [thicket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_thickets "Albany thickets"). This area produces much of the wine in South Africa and is known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the Cape of Good Hope particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many shipwrecks. Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. The annual rainfall increases south of the Lowveld, especially near the coast, which is [subtropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics "Subtropics"). The Free State is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the [Vaal River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaal_River "Vaal River"), the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat. Johannesburg, in the centre of the Highveld, is at 1,740 m (5,709 ft) above sea level and receives an annual rainfall of 760 mm (29.9 in). Winters in this region are cold, although snow is rare.<sup id="cite_ref-128"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>

The coldest place on mainland South Africa is Buffelsfontein in the [Eastern Cape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Cape "Eastern Cape"), where a temperature of −20.1 °C (−4.2 °F) was recorded in 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-129"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup> The Prince Edward Islands have colder average annual temperatures, but Buffelsfontein has colder extremes. The deep interior of mainland South Africa has the hottest temperatures: a temperature of 51.7 °C (125.06 °F) was recorded in 1948 in the Northern Cape Kalahari near [Upington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upington "Upington"),<sup id="cite_ref-130"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup> but this temperature is unofficial and was not recorded with standard equipment; the official highest temperature is 48.8 °C (119.84 °F) at [Vioolsdrif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vioolsdrif "Vioolsdrif") in January 1993.<sup id="cite_ref-131"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup>

[Climate change in South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_South_Africa "Climate change in South Africa") is leading to increased temperatures and rainfall variability. [Extreme weather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather "Extreme weather") events are becoming more prominent.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_132-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-:4-132">[132]</a></sup> This is a critical concern for South Africans as climate change will affect the overall status and wellbeing of the country, for example with regards to [water resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources "Water resources"). Speedy environmental changes are resulting in clear effects on the community and environmental level in different ways and aspects, starting with air quality, to temperature and weather patterns, reaching out to food security and disease burden.<sup id="cite_ref-133"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-133">[133]</a></sup> According to computer-generated climate modelling produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute,<sup id="cite_ref-SANBI_134-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-SANBI-134">[134]</a></sup> parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about 1 °C (1.8 °F) along the coast to more than 4 °C (7.2 °F) in the already hot [hinterland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinterland "Hinterland") such as the Northern Cape in late spring and summertime by 2050. The Cape Floral Region is predicted to be hit very hard by climate change. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire, and climbing temperatures are expected to push many rare species towards extinction. South Africa has published two national climate change reports in 2011 and 2016.<sup id="cite_ref-135"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-135">[135]</a></sup> South Africa contributes considerable [carbon dioxide emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions "Greenhouse gas emissions"), being the 14th largest emitter of carbon dioxide,<sup id="cite_ref-:32_136-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-:32-136">[136]</a></sup> primarily from its heavy reliance on coal and oil for [energy production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development "Energy development").<sup id="cite_ref-:32_136-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-:32-136">[136]</a></sup> As part of its international commitments, South Africa has pledged to peak emissions between 2020 and 2025.<sup id="cite_ref-:32_136-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-:32-136">[136]</a></sup>

South Africa signed the Rio [Convention on Biological Diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity "Convention on Biological Diversity") on 4 June 1994 and became a party to the convention on 2 November 1995.<sup id="cite_ref-137"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-137">[137]</a></sup> It has subsequently produced a [National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_action_plan "Biodiversity action plan"), which was received by the convention on 7 June 2006.<sup id="cite_ref-cbd.int_138-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-cbd.int-138">[138]</a></sup> The country is ranked sixth out of the world's seventeen [megadiverse countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadiverse_countries "Megadiverse countries").<sup id="cite_ref-139"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-139">[139]</a></sup> [Ecotourism in South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotourism_in_South_Africa "Ecotourism in South Africa") has become more prevalent in recent years, as a possible method of maintaining and improving biodiversity.

Numerous mammals are found in the Bushveld including lions, [African leopards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_leopard "African leopard"), [South African cheetahs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_African_cheetah "Southeast African cheetah"), [southern white rhinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_white_rhinoceros "Southern white rhinoceros"), [blue wildebeest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_wildebeest "Blue wildebeest"), [kudus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudu "Kudu"), [impalas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impala "Impala"), [hyenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyena "Hyena"), [hippopotamuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus "Hippopotamus") and [South African giraffes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_giraffe "South African giraffe"). A significant extent of the Bushveld exists in the north-east including Kruger National Park and the [Sabi Sand Game Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabi_Sand_Game_Reserve "Sabi Sand Game Reserve"), as well as in the far north in the [Waterberg Biosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterberg_Biosphere "Waterberg Biosphere"). South Africa houses many [endemic species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism "Endemism"), among them the critically endangered [riverine rabbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverine_rabbit "Riverine rabbit") (_Bunolagus monticullaris_) in the Karoo.

Up to 1945, more than 4,900 species of [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus "Fungus") (including [lichen-forming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen#Fungi "Lichen") species) had been recorded.<sup id="cite_ref-140"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-140">[140]</a></sup> In 2006, the number of fungi in South Africa was estimated at 200,000 species but did not take into account fungi associated with insects.<sup id="cite_ref-141"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-141">[141]</a></sup> If correct, then the number of South African fungi dwarfs that of its plants. In at least some major South African ecosystems, an exceptionally high percentage of fungi are highly specific in terms of the plants with which they occur.<sup id="cite_ref-142"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-142">[142]</a></sup> The country's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan does not mention fungi (including lichen-forming fungi).<sup id="cite_ref-cbd.int_138-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-cbd.int-138">[138]</a></sup>

With more than 22,000 different [vascular plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_plant "Vascular plant"), or about 9% of all the known species of plants on Earth,<sup id="cite_ref-143"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-143">[143]</a></sup> South Africa is particularly rich in plant diversity. The most prevalent biome is the [grassland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland "Grassland"), particularly on the Highveld, where the plant cover is dominated by different [grasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae "Poaceae"), low shrubs, and [acacia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia "Acacia"), mainly camel-thorn (_[Vachellia erioloba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vachellia_erioloba "Vachellia erioloba")_). Vegetation is sparse towards the north-west because of low rainfall. There are numerous species of water-storing succulents, like [aloes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe "Aloe") and [euphorbias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphorbia "Euphorbia"), in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area. And according to the [World Wildlife Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature "World Wide Fund for Nature"), South Africa is home to around a third of all succulent species.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_144-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-:1-144">[144]</a></sup> The grass and thorn [savanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna "Savanna") turns slowly into a bush savanna towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of [baobab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia "Adansonia") trees in this area, near the northern end of Kruger National Park.<sup id="cite_ref-145"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-145">[145]</a></sup>

The fynbos biome, which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the [Cape Floristic Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Floristic_Region "Cape Floristic Region"), is located in a small region of the Western Cape and contains more than 9,000 of those species, or three times more plant species than found in the [Amazon rainforest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest "Amazon rainforest"),<sup id="cite_ref-146"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-146">[146]</a></sup> making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of plant diversity. Most of the plants are [evergreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen "Evergreen") hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like leaves, such as the [sclerophyllous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerophyll "Sclerophyll") plants. Another uniquely South African flowering plant group is the genus _[Protea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protea "Protea")_, with around 130 different species. While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, only 1% of the land is forest, almost exclusively in the humid [coastal plain of KwaZulu-Natal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu%E2%80%93Cape_coastal_forest_mosaic "KwaZulu–Cape coastal forest mosaic"), where there are also areas of [Southern Africa mangroves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa_mangroves "Southern Africa mangroves") in river mouths. Even smaller reserves of forests are out of the reach of fire, known as [montane forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knysna%E2%80%93Amatole_montane_forests "Knysna–Amatole montane forests"). Plantations of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native [eucalyptus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus "Eucalyptus") and pine.

While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others. According to the 2022 census, the three most spoken first languages are Zulu (24.4%), Xhosa (16.6%), and Afrikaans (10.6%).<sup id="cite_ref-auto1_158-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-auto1-158">[158]</a></sup> Although English is recognised as the language of commerce and science, it is only the fifth most common home language, that of only 8.7% of South Africans in 2022; nevertheless, it has become the de facto [lingua franca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca "Lingua franca") of the nation.<sup id="cite_ref-auto1_158-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-auto1-158">[158]</a></sup> Estimates based on the 1991 census suggest just under half of South Africans could speak English.<sup id="cite_ref-162"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup> It is the second most commonly spoken language outside of the household, after Zulu.<sup id="cite_ref-163"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup>

White South Africans may also speak European languages, including Italian, Portuguese (also spoken by black Angolans and Mozambicans), Dutch, German, and Greek, while some Indian South Africans and more recent migrants from South Asia speak [Indian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India "Languages of India"), such as Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. French is spoken by migrants from [Francophone Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_French "African French").

### Religion

According to the 2001 census, Christians accounted for 79.8% of the population, with a majority of them being members of various [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism "Protestantism") [denominations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination "Christian denomination") (broadly defined to include [syncretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism "Syncretism") [African-initiated churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-initiated_church "African-initiated church")) and a minority of [Roman Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") and other Christians. Christian category includes [Zion Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion_Christian_Church "Zion Christian Church") (11.1%), [Pentecostal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecostalism "Pentecostalism") ([Charismatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charismatic_movement "Charismatic movement")) (8.2%), [Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_South_Africa "Catholic Church in South Africa") (7.1%), [Methodist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist_Church_of_Southern_Africa "Methodist Church of Southern Africa") (6.8%), [Dutch Reformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Reformed_Church_in_South_Africa_(NGK) "Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)") (6.7%), and [Anglican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church_of_Southern_Africa "Anglican Church of Southern Africa") (3.8%). Members of remaining Christian churches accounted for another 36% of the population. [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_South_Africa "Islam in South Africa") accounted for 1.5% of the population, [Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_South_Africa "Hinduism in South Africa") 1.2%,<sup id="cite_ref-state.gov_166-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-state.gov-166">[166]</a></sup> [traditional African religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_African_religions "Traditional African religions") 0.3% and Judaism 0.2%. 15.1% had no religious affiliation, 0.6% were "other" and 1.4% were "unspecified."<sup id="cite_ref-factbook_167-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-factbook-167">[167]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-state.gov_166-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-state.gov-166">[166]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-168"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-169"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup>

African-initiated churches formed the largest of the Christian groups. It was believed that many of the persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to a traditional African religion. There are an estimated 200,000 [traditional healers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_healers_of_Southern_Africa "Traditional healers of Southern Africa"), and up to 60% of South Africans consult these healers,<sup id="cite_ref-170"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup> generally called _sangoma_ ('diviner') or _inyanga_ ('herbalist'). These healers use a combination of [ancestral spiritual beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneration_of_the_dead "Veneration of the dead") and a belief in the spiritual and medicinal properties of local fauna, flora, and funga commonly known as [_muti_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_African_medicine "Traditional African medicine") ('medicine'), to facilitate healing in clients. Many peoples have syncretic religious practices combining Christian and indigenous influences.<sup id="cite_ref-DoS_171-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-DoS-171">[171]</a></sup>

South African Muslims comprise mainly Coloureds and Indians. They have been joined by black or white South African converts as well as those from other parts of Africa.<sup id="cite_ref-csmonitor_172-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-csmonitor-172">[172]</a></sup> South African Muslims describe their faith as the fastest-growing religion of conversion in the country, with the number of black Muslims growing sixfold, from 12,000 in 1991 to 74,700 in 2004.<sup id="cite_ref-csmonitor_172-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-csmonitor-172">[172]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-173"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup>

There is a substantial [Jewish population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_South_Africa "History of the Jews in South Africa"), descended from [European Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Europe "History of the Jews in Europe") who arrived as a minority among other European settlers. This population peaked in the 1970s at 118,000, though only around 75,000 remain today, the rest having emigrated, mostly to Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-174"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup> Even so, these numbers make the Jewish community in South Africa the twelfth largest in the world.

Learners have twelve years of formal schooling, from grade 1 to 12. Grade R, or grade 0, is a pre-primary foundation year.<sup id="cite_ref-edufacts0831_176-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-edufacts0831-176">[176]</a></sup> Primary schools span the first seven years of schooling.<sup id="cite_ref-177"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup> High school education spans a further five years. The [National Senior Certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriculation_in_South_Africa "Matriculation in South Africa") examination takes place at the end of grade 12 and is necessary for tertiary studies at a [South African university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_South_Africa "List of universities in South Africa").<sup id="cite_ref-edufacts0831_176-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-edufacts0831-176">[176]</a></sup> Public universities are divided into three types: traditional universities, which offer theoretically oriented university degrees; [universities of technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_technology "Institute of technology") (formerly called _[technikons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technikon "Technikon")_), which offer vocationally-oriented diplomas and degrees; and comprehensive universities, which offer both types of qualification. There are 23 public universities in South Africa: 11 traditional universities, 6 universities of technology, and 6 comprehensive universities.

Under apartheid, schools for black people were subject to discrimination through inadequate funding and a separate syllabus called _[Bantu Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_Education_Act,_1953 "Bantu Education Act, 1953")_ which only taught skills sufficient to work as labourers.<sup id="cite_ref-178"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup>

In 2004, South Africa started reforming its tertiary education system, merging and incorporating small universities into larger institutions, and renaming all tertiary education institutions "university". By 2015, 1.4 million students in higher education have been aided by a financial aid scheme which was promulgated in 1999.<sup id="cite_ref-Cele_179-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Cele-179">[179]</a></sup>

South Africa is a [parliamentary republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic "Parliamentary republic"), but unlike most such republics, the [president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Africa "President of South Africa") is both [head of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state "Head of state") and [head of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government "Head of government") and depends for their tenure on the [confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_and_supply "Confidence and supply") of [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_South_Africa "Parliament of South Africa"). The executive, legislature, and judiciary are all subject to the supremacy of the [Constitution of South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_South_Africa "Constitution of South Africa"), and the [superior courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_South_Africa "Courts of South Africa") have the power to strike down executive actions and acts of Parliament if they are unconstitutional. The [National Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_South_Africa "National Assembly of South Africa"), the lower house of Parliament, consists of 400 members and is elected every five years by a system of [party-list proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation "Party-list proportional representation"). The [National Council of Provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_Provinces "National Council of Provinces"), the upper house, consists of ninety members, with each of the nine [provincial legislatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provincial_legislature_(South_Africa) "Provincial legislature (South Africa)") electing ten members.

After each parliamentary election, the National Assembly elects one of its members as president; hence the president serves a term of office the same as that of the Assembly, normally five years. No president may serve more than two terms in office.<sup id="cite_ref-196"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup> The president appoints a [deputy president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President_of_South_Africa "Deputy President of South Africa") and [ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government) "Minister (government)") (each representing a [department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department) "Ministry (government department)")) who form the [cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_South_Africa "Cabinet of South Africa"). The National Assembly may remove the president and the cabinet by a [motion of no confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence "Motion of no confidence"). In the [most recent election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_South_African_general_election "2019 South African general election"), held on 8 May 2019, the ANC won 58% of the vote and 230 seats, while the main opposition, the [Democratic Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa) "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"), won 21% of the vote and 84 seats. The [Economic Freedom Fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters "Economic Freedom Fighters"), founded by [Julius Malema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Malema "Julius Malema"), former president of the [ANC Youth League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress_Youth_League "African National Congress Youth League") who was later expelled from the ANC, won 11% of the vote and 44 seats.

The Constitution of South Africa is the supreme rule of law in the country. The primary sources of [South African law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_South_Africa "Law of South Africa") are [Roman-Dutch mercantile law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman-Dutch_law "Roman-Dutch law") and personal law and [English Common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_law "English law"), as imports of Dutch settlements and British colonialism.<sup id="cite_ref-205"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup> The first European-based law in South Africa was brought by the Dutch East India Company and is called Roman-Dutch law. It was imported before the [codification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law) "Codification (law)") of European law into the [Napoleonic Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Code "Napoleonic Code") and is comparable in many ways to [Scots law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law "Scots law"). This was followed in the 19th century by English law, both [common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law "Common law") and [statutory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_law "Statutory law"). After unification in 1910, South Africa had its own parliament which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies. The judicial system consists of the [magistrates' courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate%27s_court_(South_Africa) "Magistrate's court (South Africa)"), which hear lesser criminal cases and smaller civil cases; the [High Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_South_Africa "High Court of South Africa"), which has divisions that serve as the courts of [general jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_jurisdiction "General jurisdiction") for specific areas; the Supreme Court of Appeal; and the Constitutional Court, which is the highest court.

Provinces are responsible for 222 951 kilometres while, according to the DoT, the municipal network is estimated at 275 661 kilometres of the proclaimed network. The rest are unproclaimed gravel roads (mainly serving rural communities) and are therefore not owned or maintained by any road authority. The country has more than 12 million motor vehicles with an average density of 16 motor vehicles per kilometre. The provincial road network is about 222 951 kilometres in length, consisting of 170 837 kilometres of unpaved and 52 114 kilometres of paved roads.<sup id="cite_ref-279"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-279">[279]</a></sup>

Around 77% of South Africa's energy needs are directly derived from coal and 92% of coal consumed on the African continent is mined in South Africa. South Africa is also the world's 14th largest emitter of [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas "Greenhouse gas").<sup id="cite_ref-291"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-291">[291]</a></sup>

The country's primary electricity generator is Eskom, the utility is the largest producer of electricity in [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa "Africa"), and is among the top seven utilities in the world in terms of generation capacity and among the top nine in terms of sales.<sup id="cite_ref-as_292-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-as-292">[292]</a></sup> It is the largest of [South Africa's state owned enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprises_of_South_Africa "State-owned enterprises of South Africa").

Due to severe mismanagement and [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_South_Africa "Corruption in South Africa") at Eskom, the company is R392bn ($22bn) in debt and is unable to meet the demands of the South African power grid.<sup id="cite_ref-296"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-296">[296]</a></sup> Due to this, Eskom implemented [loadshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadshedding "Loadshedding"), which is periodically switching off electricity to specific power grids in specific time frames. In South Africa, load shedding is done to prevent a failure of the entire system when the demand for electricity strains the capacity of Eskom's power generating system. Load shedding is characterized by periods of widespread national-level rolling blackouts.<sup id="cite_ref-297"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-297">[297]</a></sup> Eskom's latest energy availability factor (EAF) data reveals that mismanagement, corruption, poor maintenance, and sabotage caused power station breakdowns.<sup id="cite_ref-298"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-298">[298]</a></sup> In 2023 the [South African Military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_National_Defence_Force "South African National Defence Force") was deployed to protect Eskom's power stations from sabotage and theft.<sup id="cite_ref-299"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-299">[299]</a></sup>

### Water supply and sanitation

Two distinctive features of the South African water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of [water boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Board_(South_Africa) "Water Board (South Africa)"), which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities. These features have led to significant problems concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading to a lack of attention to maintenance. Following the end of apartheid, the country had made improvements in the levels of access to water as those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-JMP_307-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-JMP-307">[307]</a></sup> Sanitation access increased from 71% to 79% during the same period.<sup id="cite_ref-JMP_307-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-JMP-307">[307]</a></sup> However, water supply and sanitation has come under increasing pressure in recent years despite a commitment made by the government to improve service standards and provide investment subsidies to the water industry.<sup id="cite_ref-308"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-308">[308]</a></sup>

The eastern parts of South Africa suffer from periodic droughts linked to the [El Niño](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o "El Niño") weather phenomenon.<sup id="cite_ref-whyCapeTownDroughtConversation_309-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-whyCapeTownDroughtConversation-309">[309]</a></sup> In early 2018, Cape Town, which has different weather patterns to the rest of the country,<sup id="cite_ref-whyCapeTownDroughtConversation_309-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-whyCapeTownDroughtConversation-309">[309]</a></sup> faced a water crisis as the city's water supply was predicted to run dry before the end of June. Water-saving measures were in effect that required each citizen to use less than 50 litres (13 US gal) per day.<sup id="cite_ref-310"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-310">[310]</a></sup> Cape Town rejected an offer from Israel to help it build [desalination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desalination "Desalination") plants.<sup id="cite_ref-311"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-311">[311]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-312"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-312">[312]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-313"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-313">[313]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-314"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-314">[314]</a></sup>

## Culture

The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly urbanised and [Westernised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world"), aspects of traditional culture have declined. Members of the middle class, who have historically been predominantly white but whose ranks include growing numbers of Black, Coloured and Indian people,<sup id="cite_ref-315"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-315">[315]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-316"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-316">[316]</a></sup> have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe, North America and [Australasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australasia "Australasia").

### Arts

[South African art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_art "South African art") includes the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered in a South African cave and dated from roughly 75,000 years ago.<sup id="cite_ref-317"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-317">[317]</a></sup> The scattered tribes of the Khoisan peoples moving into South Africa from around 10,000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings. They were superseded by the Bantu/Nguni peoples with their own vocabularies of art forms. Forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. The Dutch-influenced folk art of the Afrikaner [_trekboers_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekboer "Trekboer") and the urban white artists, earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, also contributed to this eclectic mix which continues to evolve to this day.

### Popular culture

The [South African media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media_in_South_Africa "Mass media in South Africa") sector is large, and South Africa is one of Africa's major media centres. While the many broadcasters and publications reflect the diversity of the population as a whole, the most commonly used language is English. However, all ten other official languages are represented to some extent or another.

Although few [South African film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_South_Africa "Cinema of South Africa") productions are known outside South Africa, many foreign films have been produced about South Africa. Arguably, the most high-profile film portraying South Africa in recent years was _[District 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_9 "District 9")_ and its upcoming sequel, as well as _[Chappie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappie_(film) "Chappie (film)")_.

### Literature

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Alan_Paton.jpg/170px-Alan_Paton.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Alan_Paton.jpg)

[Alan Paton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Paton "Alan Paton"), [anti-apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_resistance_to_apartheid "Internal resistance to apartheid") activist and writer

[South African literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_literature "South African literature") emerged from a unique social and political history. One of the first well known novels written by a black author in an African language was [Solomon Thekiso Plaatje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Plaatje "Sol Plaatje")'s _[Mhudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mhudi "Mhudi")_, written in 1930. During the 1950s, _[Drum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_(South_African_magazine) "Drum (South African magazine)")_ magazine became a hotbed of political satire, fiction, and essays, giving a voice to the urban black culture.

Notable white South African authors include [Alan Paton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Paton "Alan Paton"), who published the novel _[Cry, the Beloved Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cry,_the_Beloved_Country "Cry, the Beloved Country")_ in 1948. [Nadine Gordimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_Gordimer "Nadine Gordimer") became the first South African to be awarded the [Nobel Prize in Literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature "Nobel Prize in Literature"), in 1991. [J.M. Coetzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Coetzee "J. M. Coetzee") won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003. When awarding the prize, the [Swedish Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Academy "Swedish Academy") stated that Coetzee "in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider."<sup id="cite_ref-Swedish_Academy_319-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-Swedish_Academy-319">[319]</a></sup>

[Breyten Breytenbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breyten_Breytenbach "Breyten Breytenbach") was jailed for his involvement with the guerrilla movement against apartheid. [André Brink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Brink "André Brink") was the first Afrikaner writer to be [banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banned_book "Banned book") by the government after he released the novel _[A Dry White Season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dry_White_Season_(novel) "A Dry White Season (novel)")_.

### Cuisine

The cuisine of South Africa is diverse, and foods from many different cultures and backgrounds are enjoyed by all communities, and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety available. The cuisine is mostly meat-based and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as the _[braai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braai "Braai")_, a variation of the [barbecue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbecue "Barbecue"). South Africa has also developed into a major [wine producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_wine "South African wine"), with some of the best [vineyards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard "Vineyard") lying in valleys around [Stellenbosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellenbosch "Stellenbosch"), [Franschhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franschhoek "Franschhoek"), [Paarl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paarl "Paarl") and [Barrydale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrydale "Barrydale").<sup id="cite_ref-320"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa#cite_note-320">[320]</a></sup>

Others pointed out that the repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored. This was the reasoning that led to a 'self-identifying' question about 'race' or 'population group' in both the 1996 and 2001 population censuses, and in Statistics SA's household survey programme.
