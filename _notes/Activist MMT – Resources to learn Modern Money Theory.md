**What is MMT?** Modern Money Theory, or MMT, is an [accurate map](https://activistmmt.org/map) of the economy, as it _already_ is. Using an accurate map makes it clear where things are and what to expect along the way. Where to go and how to get there, however, is up to you.

This post contains links to hundreds of academic works to learn more about MMT â€“ primarily from those who developed it over the past quarter century. It also contains layperson tutorials, addresses common concerns and misconceptions, and lists of many reliable people, organizations, websites, and podcasts to follow in order to ask questions and learn more.

_These resources were created by Activist #MMT, the podcast ([Twitter](http://twitter.com/ActivistMMT), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/ActivistMMT), [web](https://activistmmt.libsyn.com/), please consider becoming [a monthly patron](https://www.patreon.com/activistmmt)).

_**Disclaimer**: I have studied MMT since February of 2018. I'm not an economist or academic and I don't speak for the MMT project. The information in this post is my best understanding but in order to ensure accuracy, you should rely on the expert sources linked throughout.

(UPDATE 4/1/2024: I downgraded my Wordpress plan to save some money, which resulted in the website suddenly looking a bit more clunky than it did before. Sorry!)
