The [Lorenz attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_attractor "Lorenz attractor") arises in the study of the [Lorenz oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system "Lorenz system"), a dynamical system.

In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **dynamical system** is a system in which a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") describes the [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") dependence of a [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry) "Point (geometry)") in an [ambient space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_space "Ambient space"), such as in a [parametric curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_curve "Parametric curve"). Examples include the [mathematical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model") that describe the swinging of a clock [pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum "Pendulum"), [the flow of water in a pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"), the [random motion of particles in the air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion "Brownian motion"), and [the number of fish each springtime in a lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics "Population dynamics"). The most general definition unifies several concepts in mathematics such as [ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation") and [ergodic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory "Ergodic theory") by allowing different choices of the space and how time is measured.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Time can be measured by integers, by [real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") or [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number "Complex number") or can be a more general algebraic object, losing the memory of its physical origin, and the space may be a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") or simply a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)"), without the need of a [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiability "Differentiability") space-time structure defined on it.

At any given time, a dynamical system has a [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(controls) "State (controls)") representing a point in an appropriate [state space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_(controls) "State space (controls)"). This state is often given by a [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") of [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_numbers "Real numbers") or by a [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space "Vector space") in a geometrical manifold. The _evolution rule_ of the dynamical system is a function that describes what future states follow from the current state. Often the function is [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system_(mathematics) "Deterministic system (mathematics)"), that is, for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> However, some systems are [stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_system "Stochastic system"), in that random events also affect the evolution of the state variables.

In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics"), a **dynamical system** is described as a "particle or ensemble of particles whose state varies over time and thus obeys [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") involving time derivatives".<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> In order to make a prediction about the system's future behavior, an analytical solution of such equations or their integration over time through computer simulation is realized.

The study of dynamical systems is the focus of [dynamical systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_systems_theory "Dynamical systems theory"), which has applications to a wide variety of fields such as mathematics, physics,<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology "Biology"),<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry "Chemistry"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"),<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"),<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliodynamics "Cliodynamics"), and [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine"). Dynamical systems are a fundamental part of [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory"), [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map "Logistic map") dynamics, [bifurcation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory "Bifurcation theory"), the [self-assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-assembly "Self-assembly") and [self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization "Self-organization") processes, and the [edge of chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_of_chaos "Edge of chaos") concept.

## Overview\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Overview")\]

The concept of a dynamical system has its origins in [Newtonian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics "Newtonian mechanics"). There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is an implicit relation that gives the state of the system for only a short time into the future. (The relation is either a [differential equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation"), [difference equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation "Recurrence relation") or other [time scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_scale_calculus "Time scale calculus").) To determine the state for all future times requires iterating the relation many times—each advancing time a small step. The iteration procedure is referred to as _solving the system_ or _integrating the system_. If the system can be solved, then, given an initial point, it is possible to determine all its future positions, a collection of points known as a _[trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory")_ or _[orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(dynamics) "Orbit (dynamics)")_.

Before the advent of [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers "Computers"), finding an orbit required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could be accomplished only for a small class of dynamical systems. Numerical methods implemented on electronic computing machines have simplified the task of determining the orbits of a dynamical system.

For simple dynamical systems, knowing the trajectory is often sufficient, but most dynamical systems are too complicated to be understood in terms of individual trajectories. The difficulties arise because:

-   The systems studied may only be known approximately—the parameters of the system may not be known precisely or terms may be missing from the equations. The approximations used bring into question the validity or relevance of numerical solutions. To address these questions several notions of stability have been introduced in the study of dynamical systems, such as [Lyapunov stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_stability "Lyapunov stability") or [structural stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_stability "Structural stability"). The stability of the dynamical system implies that there is a class of models or initial conditions for which the trajectories would be equivalent. The operation for comparing orbits to establish their [equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation "Equivalence relation") changes with the different notions of stability.
-   The type of trajectory may be more important than one particular trajectory. Some trajectories may be periodic, whereas others may wander through many different states of the system. Applications often require enumerating these classes or maintaining the system within one class. Classifying all possible trajectories has led to the qualitative study of dynamical systems, that is, properties that do not change under coordinate changes. [Linear dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_dynamical_system "Linear dynamical system") and [systems that have two numbers describing a state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9%E2%80%93Bendixson_theorem "Poincaré–Bendixson theorem") are examples of dynamical systems where the possible classes of orbits are understood.
-   The behavior of trajectories as a function of a parameter may be what is needed for an application. As a parameter is varied, the dynamical systems may have [bifurcation points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory "Bifurcation theory") where the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system changes. For example, it may go from having only periodic motions to apparently erratic behavior, as in the [transition to turbulence of a fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulence "Turbulence").
-   The trajectories of the system may appear erratic, as if random. In these cases it may be necessary to compute averages using one very long trajectory or many different trajectories. The averages are well defined for [ergodic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory "Ergodic theory") and a more detailed understanding has been worked out for [hyperbolic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosov_diffeomorphism "Anosov diffeomorphism"). Understanding the probabilistic aspects of dynamical systems has helped establish the foundations of [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") and of [chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory").

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History")\]

Many people regard French mathematician [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") as the founder of dynamical systems.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Poincaré published two now classical monographs, "New Methods of Celestial Mechanics" (1892–1899) and "Lectures on Celestial Mechanics" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). These papers included the [Poincaré recurrence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_recurrence_theorem "Poincaré recurrence theorem"), which states that certain systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state very close to the initial state.

[Aleksandr Lyapunov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Lyapunov "Aleksandr Lyapunov") developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a dynamical system.

In 1913, [George David Birkhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_David_Birkhoff "George David Birkhoff") proved Poincaré's "[Last Geometric Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9%E2%80%93Birkhoff_theorem "Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem")", a special case of the [three-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem "Three-body problem"), a result that made him world-famous. In 1927, he published his _[Dynamical Systems](https://www.ams.org/online_bks/coll9/)_. Birkhoff's most durable result has been his 1931 discovery of what is now called the [ergodic theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theorem "Ergodic theorem"). Combining insights from [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") on the [ergodic hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis "Ergodic hypothesis") with [measure theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory "Measure theory"), this theorem solved, at least in principle, a fundamental problem of [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"). The ergodic theorem has also had repercussions for dynamics.

[Stephen Smale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Smale "Stephen Smale") made significant advances as well. His first contribution was the [Smale horseshoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_map "Horseshoe map") that jumpstarted significant research in dynamical systems. He also outlined a research program carried out by many others.

[Oleksandr Mykolaiovych Sharkovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Mykolaiovych_Sharkovsky "Oleksandr Mykolaiovych Sharkovsky") developed [Sharkovsky's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharkovsky%27s_theorem "Sharkovsky's theorem") on the periods of [discrete dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_dynamical_system "Discrete dynamical system") in 1964. One of the implications of the theorem is that if a discrete dynamical system on the [real line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line "Real line") has a [periodic point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_point "Periodic point") of period 3, then it must have periodic points of every other period.

In the late 20th century the dynamical system perspective to partial differential equations started gaining popularity. Palestinian mechanical engineer [Ali H. Nayfeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_H._Nayfeh "Ali H. Nayfeh") applied [nonlinear dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dynamics "Nonlinear dynamics") in [mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics") and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering") systems.<sup id="cite_ref-Rega_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-Rega-10">[10]</a></sup> His pioneering work in applied nonlinear dynamics has been influential in the construction and maintenance of [machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machines "Machines") and [structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structures "Structures") that are common in daily life, such as [ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ships "Ships"), [cranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(machine) "Crane (machine)"), [bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridges "Bridges"), [buildings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buildings "Buildings"), [skyscrapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscrapers "Skyscrapers"), [jet engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engines "Jet engines"), [rocket engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engines "Rocket engines"), [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft "Aircraft") and [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft "Spacecraft").<sup id="cite_ref-fi_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-fi-11">[11]</a></sup>

## Formal definition\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Formal definition")\]

In the most general sense,<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> a **dynamical system** is a [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple "Tuple") (_T_, _X_, Φ) where _T_ is a [monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid "Monoid"), written additively, _X_ is a non-empty [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)") and Φ is a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)")

![{\displaystyle \Phi :U\subseteq (T\times X)\to X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/732eb5be439c409f5d0ce5be723066e594884e95)

with

![{\displaystyle \mathrm {proj} _{2}(U)=X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc4c1da3d9a1d8f0d65baf05c3f01166011a1680) (where ![{\displaystyle \mathrm {proj} _{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2919c1f052c657116192b06356d8f981b37accda) is the 2nd [projection map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(set_theory) "Projection (set theory)"))

and for any _x_ in _X_:

![{\displaystyle \Phi (0,x)=x}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3d9e28a8cff06417aaade77a86a849dd787747dd)

![{\displaystyle \Phi (t_{2},\Phi (t_{1},x))=\Phi (t_{2}+t_{1},x),}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/651726633cd281ebfdba0136711c7d17de096d99)

for ![{\displaystyle \,t_{1},\,t_{2}+t_{1}\in I(x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/84acbe7b6ebcce85a48629c1868d996694918766) and ![{\displaystyle \ t_{2}\in I(\Phi (t_{1},x))}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e17f67a2ef8a2474dddaf35661e8f9e4e7395d09), where we have defined the set ![{\displaystyle I(x):=\{t\in T:(t,x)\in U\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bbd29eccb991fe8dda96b609b610c8540bad1410) for any _x_ in _X_.

In particular, in the case that ![{\displaystyle U=T\times X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b54a5da30f132fe5663513da84669f6f5aaade79) we have for every _x_ in _X_ that ![{\displaystyle I(x)=T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/53ec9d98eb426eb6deec2b66aeaa8ad32bab1fb5) and thus that Φ defines a [monoid action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup_action "Semigroup action") of _T_ on _X_.

The function Φ(_t_,_x_) is called the **evolution function** of the dynamical system: it associates to every point _x_ in the set _X_ a unique image, depending on the variable _t_, called the **evolution parameter**. _X_ is called **[phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space "Phase space")** or **state space**, while the variable _x_ represents an **initial state** of the system.

We often write

![{\displaystyle \Phi _{x}(t)\equiv \Phi (t,x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/de52b04df90526084d44a8d5e6c83305c5883233)

![{\displaystyle \Phi ^{t}(x)\equiv \Phi (t,x)}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5628d746f45c377395f6e14817e0ecfcd87eb989)

if we take one of the variables as constant. The function

![{\displaystyle \Phi _{x}:I(x)\to X}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/af8bcdb2390e5cb5c35d792eb024edc9889c42fb)

is called the **flow** through _x_ and its [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(function) "Graph (function)") is called the **[trajectory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory "Trajectory")** through _x_. The set

![{\displaystyle \gamma _{x}\equiv \{\Phi (t,x):t\in I(x)\}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a045112abfddc396ffd69e19d3d6ab6b24e61037)

is called the **[orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(dynamics) "Orbit (dynamics)")** through _x_. The orbit through _x_ is the [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_(mathematics) "Image (mathematics)") of the flow through _x_. A subset _S_ of the state space _X_ is called Φ-**invariant** if for all _x_ in _S_ and all _t_ in _T_

![{\displaystyle \Phi (t,x)\in S.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1c9d9a81a06e1c9badc03b812ac535ae81d0bc2b)

Thus, in particular, if _S_ is Φ-**invariant**, ![{\displaystyle I(x)=T}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/53ec9d98eb426eb6deec2b66aeaa8ad32bab1fb5) for all _x_ in _S_. That is, the flow through _x_ must be defined for all time for every element of _S_.

More commonly there are two classes of definitions for a dynamical system: one is motivated by [ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation") and is geometrical in flavor; and the other is motivated by [ergodic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory "Ergodic theory") and is [measure theoretical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)#Measure_theory "Measure (mathematics)") in flavor.

### Geometrical definition\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Geometrical definition")\]

In the geometrical definition, a dynamical system is the tuple ![{\displaystyle \langle {\mathcal {T}},{\mathcal {M}},f\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ae280ece9a08ab14dcc4c84ce3b4597a6f1c047c). ![{\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8236d074e42310f5dc24d1d2b5b8f5981c3e87ba) is the domain for time – there are many choices, usually the reals or the integers, possibly restricted to be non-negative. ![{\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2cc2abebd45ec020509a0ec548b67c9a2cb7cecd) is a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold"), i.e. locally a Banach space or Euclidean space, or in the discrete case a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics) "Graph (discrete mathematics)"). _f_ is an evolution rule _t_ → _f_ <sup>&nbsp;<i>t</i></sup> (with ![{\displaystyle t\in {\mathcal {T}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/96b8b08dd997064818370e5546e240e53155d8a4)) such that _f <sup>&nbsp;t</sup>_ is a [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism "Diffeomorphism") of the manifold to itself. So, f is a "smooth" mapping of the time-domain ![{\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8236d074e42310f5dc24d1d2b5b8f5981c3e87ba) into the space of diffeomorphisms of the manifold to itself. In other terms, _f_(_t_) is a diffeomorphism, for every time _t_ in the domain ![{\displaystyle {\mathcal {T}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8236d074e42310f5dc24d1d2b5b8f5981c3e87ba) .

#### Real dynamical system\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Real dynamical system")\]

A _real dynamical system_, _real-time dynamical system_, _[continuous time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_time "Continuous time") dynamical system_, or _[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(mathematics) "Flow (mathematics)")_ is a tuple (_T_, _M_, Φ) with _T_ an [open interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_interval "Open interval") in the [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "Real number") **R**, _M_ a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") locally [diffeomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphic "Diffeomorphic") to a [Banach space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space "Banach space"), and Φ a [continuous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function"). If Φ is [continuously differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_differentiable "Continuously differentiable") we say the system is a _differentiable dynamical system_. If the manifold _M_ is locally diffeomorphic to **R**<sup><i>n</i></sup>, the dynamical system is _finite-dimensional_; if not, the dynamical system is _infinite-dimensional_. This does not assume a [symplectic structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_manifold "Symplectic manifold"). When _T_ is taken to be the reals, the dynamical system is called _global_ or a _[flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(mathematics) "Flow (mathematics)")_; and if _T_ is restricted to the non-negative reals, then the dynamical system is a _semi-flow_.

#### Discrete dynamical system\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Discrete dynamical system")\]

A _discrete dynamical system_, _[discrete-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time "Discrete-time") dynamical system_ is a tuple (_T_, _M_, Φ), where _M_ is a [manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold "Manifold") locally diffeomorphic to a [Banach space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space "Banach space"), and Φ is a function. When _T_ is taken to be the integers, it is a _cascade_ or a _map_. If _T_ is restricted to the non-negative integers we call the system a _semi-cascade_.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

#### Cellular automaton\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Cellular automaton")\]

A _cellular automaton_ is a tuple (_T_, _M_, Φ), with _T_ a [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(group) "Lattice (group)") such as the [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "Integer") or a higher-dimensional [integer grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_lattice "Integer lattice"), _M_ is a set of functions from an integer lattice (again, with one or more dimensions) to a finite set, and Φ a (locally defined) evolution function. As such [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automata "Cellular automata") are dynamical systems. The lattice in _M_ represents the "space" lattice, while the one in _T_ represents the "time" lattice.

#### Multidimensional generalization\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Multidimensional generalization")\]

Dynamical systems are usually defined over a single independent variable, thought of as time. A more general class of systems are defined over multiple independent variables and are therefore called [multidimensional systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_systems "Multidimensional systems"). Such systems are useful for modeling, for example, [image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing "Image processing").

#### Compactification of a dynamical system\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Compactification of a dynamical system")\]

Given a global dynamical system (**R**, _X_, Φ) on a [locally compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact "Locally compact") and [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space "Hausdorff space") [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space "Topological space") _X_, it is often useful to study the continuous extension Φ\* of Φ to the [one-point compactification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-point_compactification "One-point compactification") _X\*_ of _X_. Although we lose the differential structure of the original system we can now use compactness arguments to analyze the new system (**R**, _X\*_, Φ\*).

In compact dynamical systems the [limit set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_set "Limit set") of any orbit is [non-empty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-empty "Non-empty"), [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space") and [simply connected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_connected "Simply connected").

### Measure theoretical definition\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Measure theoretical definition")\]

A dynamical system may be defined formally as a measure-preserving transformation of a [measure space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_space "Measure space"), the triplet (_T_, (_X_, Σ, _μ_), Φ). Here, _T_ is a monoid (usually the non-negative integers), _X_ is a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) "Set (mathematics)"), and (_X_, Σ, _μ_) is a [probability space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_space "Measure space"), meaning that Σ is a [sigma-algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma-algebra "Sigma-algebra") on _X_ and μ is a finite [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics) "Measure (mathematics)") on (_X_, Σ). A map Φ: _X_ → _X_ is said to be [Σ-measurable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function "Measurable function") if and only if, for every σ in Σ, one has ![{\displaystyle \Phi ^{-1}\sigma \in \Sigma }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/607d3fe252fc139072a0d91d8dbb09daeaf2eac5). A map Φ is said to **preserve the measure** if and only if, for every _σ_ in Σ, one has ![{\displaystyle \mu (\Phi ^{-1}\sigma )=\mu (\sigma )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f86aabd5c91404b2c1ba4ddbbc0b1e721f6b78a5). Combining the above, a map Φ is said to be a **measure-preserving transformation of _X_** , if it is a map from _X_ to itself, it is Σ-measurable, and is measure-preserving. The triplet (_T_, (_X_, Σ, _μ_), Φ), for such a Φ, is then defined to be a **dynamical system**.

The map Φ embodies the time evolution of the dynamical system. Thus, for discrete dynamical systems the [iterates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function "Iterated function") ![{\displaystyle \Phi ^{n}=\Phi \circ \Phi \circ \dots \circ \Phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/681995985709ecf80a8dfce5bc91b9bb3be67579) for every integer _n_ are studied. For continuous dynamical systems, the map Φ is understood to be a finite time evolution map and the construction is more complicated.

#### Relation to geometric definition\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Relation to geometric definition")\]

The measure theoretical definition assumes the existence of a measure-preserving transformation. Many different invariant measures can be associated to any one evolution rule. If the dynamical system is given by a system of differential equations the appropriate measure must be determined. This makes it difficult to develop ergodic theory starting from differential equations, so it becomes convenient to have a dynamical systems-motivated definition within ergodic theory that side-steps the choice of measure and assumes the choice has been made. A simple construction (sometimes called the [Krylov–Bogolyubov theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krylov%E2%80%93Bogolyubov_theorem "Krylov–Bogolyubov theorem")) shows that for a large class of systems it is always possible to construct a measure so as to make the evolution rule of the dynamical system a measure-preserving transformation. In the construction a given measure of the state space is summed for all future points of a trajectory, assuring the invariance.

Some systems have a natural measure, such as the [Liouville measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(Hamiltonian) "Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)") in [Hamiltonian systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_system "Hamiltonian system"), chosen over other invariant measures, such as the measures supported on periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian system. For chaotic [dissipative systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipative_system "Dissipative system") the choice of invariant measure is technically more challenging. The measure needs to be supported on the [attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor "Attractor"), but attractors have zero [Lebesgue measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure "Lebesgue measure") and the invariant measures must be singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure. A small region of phase space shrinks under time evolution.

For hyperbolic dynamical systems, the [Sinai–Ruelle–Bowen measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai%E2%80%93Ruelle%E2%80%93Bowen_measure "Sinai–Ruelle–Bowen measure") appear to be the natural choice. They are constructed on the geometrical structure of [stable and unstable manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_manifold "Stable manifold") of the dynamical system; they behave physically under small perturbations; and they explain many of the observed statistics of hyperbolic systems.

## Construction of dynamical systems\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Construction of dynamical systems")\]

The concept of _evolution in time_ is central to the theory of dynamical systems as seen in the previous sections: the basic reason for this fact is that the starting motivation of the theory was the study of time behavior of [classical mechanical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"). But a system of [ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation "Ordinary differential equation") must be solved before it becomes a dynamic system. For example consider an [initial value problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem "Initial value problem") such as the following:

![{\displaystyle {\dot {\boldsymbol {x}}}={\boldsymbol {v}}(t,{\boldsymbol {x}})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5dd5bba9d6211abb566cc94c1578ceac08acc821)

![{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {x}}|_{t=0}={\boldsymbol {x}}_{0}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f5e15680d9f6f907f61cc6eb664d1f3287646120)

where

-   ![{\displaystyle {\dot {\boldsymbol {x}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/29815af430ef19272d18d70c289e0073e50ff381) represents the [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") of the material point **x**
-   _M_ is a finite dimensional manifold
-   **v**: _T_ × _M_ → _TM_ is a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") in **R**<sup><i>n</i></sup> or **C**<sup><i>n</i></sup> and represents the change of [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity") induced by the known [forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") acting on the given material point in the phase space _M_. The change is not a vector in the phase space _M_, but is instead in the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space "Tangent space") _TM_.

There is no need for higher order derivatives in the equation, nor for the parameter _t_ in _v_(_t_,_x_), because these can be eliminated by considering systems of higher dimensions.

Depending on the properties of this vector field, the mechanical system is called

-   **autonomous**, when **v**(_t_, **x**) = **v**(**x**)
-   **homogeneous** when **v**(_t_, **0**) = 0 for all _t_

The solution can be found using standard ODE techniques and is denoted as the evolution function already introduced above

![{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {x}}(t)=\Phi (t,{\boldsymbol {x}}_{0})}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ec6f1dc90a51280a25f803eac25bf3cfe23399ec)

The dynamical system is then (_T_, _M_, Φ).

Some formal manipulation of the system of [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") shown above gives a more general form of equations a dynamical system must satisfy

![{\displaystyle {\dot {\boldsymbol {x}}}-{\boldsymbol {v}}(t,{\boldsymbol {x}})=0\qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad {\mathfrak {G}}\left(t,\Phi (t,{\boldsymbol {x}}_{0})\right)=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9b7ee0e21b3c136c0871919a453af320d47de7c3)

where ![{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {G}}:{{(T\times M)}^{M}}\to \mathbf {C} }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/48826ea63d11f9d36ae5b1583780ba65329d2df3) is a [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics) "Functional (mathematics)") from the set of evolution functions to the field of the complex numbers.

This equation is useful when modeling mechanical systems with complicated constraints.

Many of the concepts in dynamical systems can be extended to infinite-dimensional manifolds—those that are locally [Banach spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space "Banach space")—in which case the differential equations are [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation").

## Linear dynamical systems\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Linear dynamical systems")\]

Linear dynamical systems can be solved in terms of simple functions and the behavior of all orbits classified. In a linear system the phase space is the _N_\-dimensional Euclidean space, so any point in phase space can be represented by a vector with _N_ numbers. The analysis of linear systems is possible because they satisfy a [superposition principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle "Superposition principle"): if _u_(_t_) and _w_(_t_) satisfy the differential equation for the vector field (but not necessarily the initial condition), then so will _u_(_t_) + _w_(_t_).

### Flows\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Flows")\]

For a [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(mathematics) "Flow (mathematics)"), the vector field v(_x_) is an [affine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation") function of the position in the phase space, that is,

![{\displaystyle {\dot {x}}=v(x)=Ax+b,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e50c441245a312d954d597bc01e96d758859bdf4)

with _A_ a matrix, _b_ a vector of numbers and _x_ the position vector. The solution to this system can be found by using the superposition principle (linearity). The case _b_ ≠ 0 with _A_ = 0 is just a straight line in the direction of _b_:

![{\displaystyle \Phi ^{t}(x_{1})=x_{1}+bt.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/486686b3377dc08ad0e8c44b9f214ebdd4dd283d)

When _b_ is zero and _A_ ≠ 0 the origin is an equilibrium (or singular) point of the flow, that is, if _x_<sub>0</sub> = 0, then the orbit remains there. For other initial conditions, the equation of motion is given by the [exponential of a matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_exponential "Matrix exponential"): for an initial point _x_<sub>0</sub>,

![{\displaystyle \Phi ^{t}(x_{0})=e^{tA}x_{0}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/85622e724fee765e7c698b28acb556fba8cad097)

When _b_ = 0, the [eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue "Eigenvalue") of _A_ determine the structure of the phase space. From the eigenvalues and the [eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector "Eigenvector") of _A_ it is possible to determine if an initial point will converge or diverge to the equilibrium point at the origin.

The distance between two different initial conditions in the case _A_ ≠ 0 will change exponentially in most cases, either converging exponentially fast towards a point, or diverging exponentially fast. Linear systems display sensitive dependence on initial conditions in the case of divergence. For nonlinear systems this is one of the (necessary but not sufficient) conditions for [chaotic behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory").

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/LinearFields.png/500px-LinearFields.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LinearFields.png)

Linear vector fields and a few trajectories.

### Maps\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Maps")\]

A [discrete-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-time_dynamical_system "Discrete-time dynamical system"), [affine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation "Affine transformation") dynamical system has the form of a [matrix difference equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_difference_equation "Matrix difference equation"):

![{\displaystyle x_{n+1}=Ax_{n}+b,}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc592220436380e1bfa99c2d3984a39ad2f1cadb)

with _A_ a matrix and _b_ a vector. As in the continuous case, the change of coordinates _x_ → _x_ + (1 − _A_) <sup>&nbsp;–1</sup>_b_ removes the term _b_ from the equation. In the new [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system"), the origin is a fixed point of the map and the solutions are of the linear system _A_ <sup>&nbsp;<i>n</i></sup>_x_<sub>0</sub>. The solutions for the map are no longer curves, but points that hop in the phase space. The orbits are organized in curves, or fibers, which are collections of points that map into themselves under the action of the map.

As in the continuous case, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of _A_ determine the structure of phase space. For example, if _u_<sub>1</sub> is an eigenvector of _A_, with a real eigenvalue smaller than one, then the straight lines given by the points along _α_ _u_<sub>1</sub>, with _α_ ∈ **R**, is an invariant curve of the map. Points in this straight line run into the fixed point.

There are also many [other discrete dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chaotic_maps "List of chaotic maps").

## Local dynamics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Local dynamics")\]

The qualitative properties of dynamical systems do not change under a smooth change of coordinates (this is sometimes taken as a definition of qualitative): a _singular point_ of the vector field (a point where _v_(_x_) = 0) will remain a singular point under smooth transformations; a _periodic orbit_ is a loop in phase space and smooth deformations of the phase space cannot alter it being a loop. It is in the neighborhood of singular points and periodic orbits that the structure of a phase space of a dynamical system can be well understood. In the qualitative study of dynamical systems, the approach is to show that there is a change of coordinates (usually unspecified, but computable) that makes the dynamical system as simple as possible.

### Rectification\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Rectification")\]

A flow in most small patches of the phase space can be made very simple. If _y_ is a point where the vector field _v_(_y_) ≠ 0, then there is a change of coordinates for a region around _y_ where the vector field becomes a series of parallel vectors of the same magnitude. This is known as the rectification theorem.

The _rectification theorem_ says that away from [singular points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_singularity "Mathematical singularity") the dynamics of a point in a small patch is a straight line. The patch can sometimes be enlarged by stitching several patches together, and when this works out in the whole phase space _M_ the dynamical system is _integrable_. In most cases the patch cannot be extended to the entire phase space. There may be singular points in the vector field (where _v_(_x_) = 0); or the patches may become smaller and smaller as some point is approached. The more subtle reason is a global constraint, where the trajectory starts out in a patch, and after visiting a series of other patches comes back to the original one. If the next time the orbit loops around phase space in a different way, then it is impossible to rectify the vector field in the whole series of patches.

### Near periodic orbits\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Near periodic orbits")\]

In general, in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit the rectification theorem cannot be used. Poincaré developed an approach that transforms the analysis near a periodic orbit to the analysis of a map. Pick a point _x_<sub>0</sub> in the orbit γ and consider the points in phase space in that neighborhood that are perpendicular to _v_(_x_<sub>0</sub>). These points are a [Poincaré section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_section "Poincaré section") _S_(_γ_, _x_<sub>0</sub>), of the orbit. The flow now defines a map, the [Poincaré map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_map "Poincaré map") _F_ : _S_ → _S_, for points starting in _S_ and returning to _S_. Not all these points will take the same amount of time to come back, but the times will be close to the time it takes _x_<sub>0</sub>.

The intersection of the periodic orbit with the Poincaré section is a fixed point of the Poincaré map _F_. By a translation, the point can be assumed to be at _x_ = 0. The Taylor series of the map is _F_(_x_) = _J_ · _x_ + O(_x_<sup>2</sup>), so a change of coordinates _h_ can only be expected to simplify _F_ to its linear part

![{\displaystyle h^{-1}\circ F\circ h(x)=J\cdot x.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a412195d022a54f6f29f5e038bb6ee2b1227cf3e)

This is known as the conjugation equation. Finding conditions for this equation to hold has been one of the major tasks of research in dynamical systems. Poincaré first approached it assuming all functions to be analytic and in the process discovered the non-resonant condition. If _λ_<sub>1</sub>, ..., _λ_<sub><i>ν</i></sub> are the eigenvalues of _J_ they will be resonant if one eigenvalue is an integer linear combination of two or more of the others. As terms of the form _λ_<sub><i>i</i></sub> – Σ (multiples of other eigenvalues) occurs in the denominator of the terms for the function _h_, the non-resonant condition is also known as the small divisor problem.

### Conjugation results\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Conjugation results")\]

The results on the existence of a solution to the conjugation equation depend on the eigenvalues of _J_ and the degree of smoothness required from _h_. As _J_ does not need to have any special symmetries, its eigenvalues will typically be complex numbers. When the eigenvalues of _J_ are not in the unit circle, the dynamics near the fixed point _x_<sub>0</sub> of _F_ is called _[hyperbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_fixed_point "Hyperbolic fixed point")_ and when the eigenvalues are on the unit circle and complex, the dynamics is called _elliptic_.

In the hyperbolic case, the [Hartman–Grobman theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartman%E2%80%93Grobman_theorem "Hartman–Grobman theorem") gives the conditions for the existence of a continuous function that maps the neighborhood of the fixed point of the map to the linear map _J_ · _x_. The hyperbolic case is also _structurally stable_. Small changes in the vector field will only produce small changes in the Poincaré map and these small changes will reflect in small changes in the position of the eigenvalues of _J_ in the complex plane, implying that the map is still hyperbolic.

The [Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Arnold%E2%80%93Moser_theorem "Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem") theorem gives the behavior near an elliptic point.

## Bifurcation theory\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Bifurcation theory")\]

When the evolution map Φ<sup><i>t</i></sup> (or the [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field "Vector field") it is derived from) depends on a parameter μ, the structure of the phase space will also depend on this parameter. Small changes may produce no qualitative changes in the [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space "Phase space") until a special value _μ_<sub>0</sub> is reached. At this point the phase space changes qualitatively and the dynamical system is said to have gone through a bifurcation.

Bifurcation theory considers a structure in phase space (typically a [fixed point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_(mathematics) "Fixed point (mathematics)"), a periodic orbit, or an invariant [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus "Torus")) and studies its behavior as a function of the parameter _μ_. At the bifurcation point the structure may change its stability, split into new structures, or merge with other structures. By using Taylor series approximations of the maps and an understanding of the differences that may be eliminated by a change of coordinates, it is possible to catalog the bifurcations of dynamical systems.

The bifurcations of a hyperbolic fixed point _x_<sub>0</sub> of a system family _F<sub>μ</sub>_ can be characterized by the [eigenvalues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues "Eigenvalues") of the first derivative of the system _DF_<sub><i>μ</i></sub>(_x_<sub>0</sub>) computed at the bifurcation point. For a map, the bifurcation will occur when there are eigenvalues of _DF<sub>μ</sub>_ on the unit circle. For a flow, it will occur when there are eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. For more information, see the main article on [Bifurcation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_theory "Bifurcation theory").

Some bifurcations can lead to very complicated structures in phase space. For example, the [Ruelle–Takens scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ruelle%E2%80%93Takens_scenario&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ruelle–Takens scenario (page does not exist)") describes how a periodic orbit bifurcates into a torus and the torus into a [strange attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_attractor "Strange attractor"). In another example, [Feigenbaum period-doubling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifurcation_diagram "Bifurcation diagram") describes how a stable periodic orbit goes through a series of [period-doubling bifurcations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period-doubling_bifurcation "Period-doubling bifurcation").

## Ergodic systems\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Ergodic systems")\]

In many dynamical systems, it is possible to choose the coordinates of the system so that the volume (really a ν-dimensional volume) in phase space is invariant. This happens for mechanical systems derived from Newton's laws as long as the coordinates are the position and the momentum and the volume is measured in units of (position) × (momentum). The flow takes points of a subset _A_ into the points Φ <sup>&nbsp;<i>t</i></sup>(_A_) and invariance of the phase space means that

![{\displaystyle \mathrm {vol} (A)=\mathrm {vol} (\Phi ^{t}(A)).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ceec97d7ac3c4fe273369dc1dabd430bb2ee4d3d)

In the [Hamiltonian formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics "Hamiltonian mechanics"), given a coordinate it is possible to derive the appropriate (generalized) momentum such that the associated volume is preserved by the flow. The volume is said to be computed by the [Liouville measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(Hamiltonian) "Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)").

In a Hamiltonian system, not all possible configurations of position and momentum can be reached from an initial condition. Because of energy conservation, only the states with the same energy as the initial condition are accessible. The states with the same energy form an energy shell Ω, a sub-manifold of the phase space. The volume of the energy shell, computed using the Liouville measure, is preserved under evolution.

For systems where the volume is preserved by the flow, Poincaré discovered the [recurrence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_recurrence_theorem "Poincaré recurrence theorem"): Assume the phase space has a finite Liouville volume and let _F_ be a phase space volume-preserving map and _A_ a subset of the phase space. Then almost every point of _A_ returns to _A_ infinitely often. The Poincaré recurrence theorem was used by [Zermelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Zermelo "Ernst Zermelo") to object to [Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann")'s derivation of the increase in entropy in a dynamical system of colliding atoms.

One of the questions raised by Boltzmann's work was the possible equality between time averages and space averages, what he called the [ergodic hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis "Ergodic hypothesis"). The hypothesis states that the length of time a typical trajectory spends in a region _A_ is vol(_A_)/vol(Ω).

The ergodic hypothesis turned out not to be the essential property needed for the development of [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics") and a series of other ergodic-like properties were introduced to capture the relevant aspects of physical systems. [Koopman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Koopman "Bernard Koopman") approached the study of ergodic systems by the use of [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis "Functional analysis"). An observable _a_ is a function that to each point of the phase space associates a number (say instantaneous pressure, or average height). The value of an observable can be computed at another time by using the evolution function φ <sup>&nbsp;t</sup>. This introduces an operator _U_ <sup>&nbsp;<i>t</i></sup>, the [transfer operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_operator "Transfer operator"),

![{\displaystyle (U^{t}a)(x)=a(\Phi ^{-t}(x)).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bf5b230fec2f0df937c48b7e9c01b1e6cdc3b2ae)

By studying the spectral properties of the linear operator _U_ it becomes possible to classify the ergodic properties of Φ <sup>&nbsp;<i>t</i></sup>. In using the Koopman approach of considering the action of the flow on an observable function, the finite-dimensional nonlinear problem involving Φ <sup>&nbsp;<i>t</i></sup> gets mapped into an infinite-dimensional linear problem involving _U_.

The Liouville measure restricted to the energy surface Ω is the basis for the averages computed in [equilibrium statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics "Statistical mechanics"). An average in time along a trajectory is equivalent to an average in space computed with the [Boltzmann factor exp(−β_H_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics#Canonical_ensemble "Statistical mechanics"). This idea has been generalized by Sinai, Bowen, and Ruelle (SRB) to a larger class of dynamical systems that includes dissipative systems. [SRB measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRB_measure "SRB measure") replace the Boltzmann factor and they are defined on attractors of chaotic systems.

### Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos")\]

Simple nonlinear dynamical systems and even piecewise linear systems can exhibit a completely unpredictable behavior, which might seem to be random, despite the fact that they are fundamentally deterministic. This seemingly unpredictable behavior has been called _[chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory")_. [Hyperbolic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosov_diffeomorphism "Anosov diffeomorphism") are precisely defined dynamical systems that exhibit the properties ascribed to chaotic systems. In hyperbolic systems the tangent space perpendicular to a trajectory can be well separated into two parts: one with the points that converge towards the orbit (the _stable manifold_) and another of the points that diverge from the orbit (the _unstable manifold_).

This branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") deals with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like "Will the system settle down to a [steady state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state "Steady state") in the long term, and if so, what are the possible [attractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor "Attractor")?" or "Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?"

The chaotic behavior of complex systems is not the issue. [Meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology") has been known for years to involve complex—even chaotic—behavior. Chaos theory has been so surprising because chaos can be found within almost trivial systems. The [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map "Logistic map") is only a second-degree polynomial; the [horseshoe map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_map "Horseshoe map") is piecewise linear.

### Solutions of Finite Duration\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dynamical_system&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Solutions of Finite Duration")\]

For non-linear autonomous ODEs it is possible under some conditions to develop solutions of finite duration,<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> meaning here that from its own dynamics, the system will reach the value zero at an ending time and stays there in zero forever after. These finite-duration solutions cannot be analytical functions on the whole real line, and because they are non-Lipschitz functions at their ending time, they are not unique solutions of Lipschitz differential equations.

As example, the equation:

![{\displaystyle y'=-{\text{sgn}}(y){\sqrt {|y|}},\,\,y(0)=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68b45194c3307d9990aad8650196feb49814b370)

Admits the finite duration solution:

![{\displaystyle y(x)={\frac {1}{4}}\left(1-{\frac {x}{2}}+\left|1-{\frac {x}{2}}\right|\right)^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/665b5de4aab627476048f5598a8a8f41a0861a27)
