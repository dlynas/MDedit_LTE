## I think Michael and Peter downplayed how common misapplication of identity politics is in leftist circles

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IfBooksCouldKill/comments/18lhgvr/i_think_michael_and_peter_downplayed_how_common/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IfBooksCouldKill/comments/18lhgvr/i_think_michael_and_peter_downplayed_how_common/)

> Edit: The responses here have been mixed. Thanks to the people who genuinely engaged with me. These discussions inspired me to read Elite Capture which is amazing so far and I suggest it.
> 
> Quick points to some of the reactions I've received: 
> 
> 1) Some people dismissed this as a bunch of young college students. These anecdotes involved cases in university and outside of it. The ones in universities all involved grad students and professors who ranged widely in age.
> 
> 2) It is the case that one thing can be a bigger problem and another thing is still a problem even if it is smaller. I tried to make it clear multiple times in this post that I think problems of discrimination and structural inequalities are bigger problems. That's not the debate here.
> 
> 3) Some people think we shouldn't talk about this in public spaces because the right will take advantage of that. I disagree but it is a legitimate discussion to be had.
>

> 
> Overall, I really liked the episode and agreed with most of what they said. My main problem though is that I believe the extreme examples of identity politics gone wrong are more common than they give credit for. The idea that we’ve now gone too far with diversity is dumb. It is also true that most people on the left do not believe in the extremes/misapplication of identity politics. However, I’d argue that they are very common in most academic institutions and leftist organizations. It’s not just teenagers on the Internet. They’re not as powerful as elected politicians or radical right wingers, but they do influence certain policies/programs as well as alienate other people. Mounk may not have had many good examples, but I can name some from my years being in grad school and activist circles.
> 
> 1. My department creating segregated racial justice groups. A grad student wanted to create a racial justice group devoted to analyzing whether our department policies were affecting POC disproportionately. People signed up and then we receive an email that most people who signed up were white and that is a problem because POC need to be centered in the conversation. The solution is for white people to not speak at all during meetings. The group then just kind of lost steam. A few months later someone else decides to start another racial justice group. They argue that it is unfair to expect POC to do all the work of dismantling racism so instead we need a white people racial justice group (the White Accountability group). We have a mostly all white meeting and it turns into a book club where white people read books on racism.
> 2. People expecting in multiple classrooms that discussions on certain topics should only be limited to people that are part of said group. One example was someone saying that only queer people should talk about sexuality during group discussions in the Society and Sexuality class (yes class participation was required.)
> 3. People saying that no one should conduct a research project on a group they are not a part of and being generally unhelpful when people try to do so (this one is touchy because people do need to establish trust with groups but the issue here is many people fundamentally believe you cannot do research on a group you aren't a part of).
> 4. I signed up to speak at an protest against overturning Roe v. Wade. I was going to speak about the area I conducted my research on which is directly related to abortion rights. An organizer emailed me that they were really sorry but they kicked me off the speaker list because they realized there were no women of color signed up. This was still true at the event, but we did get two men of color speaking so they tried I guess (yes all the organizers were white).
> 5. Local socialist club implemented a rule that is a bit convoluted but basically makes it to where if a woman or POC runs for election at the chapter then they will automatically win at least one position.
> 6. Local feminists freaking out when the university elected a man to run the gender studies program. I helped with that search and everyone agreed he was the best applicant. Also he was an openly gay man who was a professor of theater that had years of experience in feminist and queer circles.
> 
> I could list other things but I’ll stop here. My general experience is that leftist circles are filled with this exact kind of essentialist identity politics that misapplies intersectional theory and alienates people. All of these things are minor when compared to the discrimination and structural inequality that exists today. I am not arguing white people actually have it worse. They don’t. What I’m arguing is that these instances aren’t just limited to a couple of people or to irrelevant Internet discourse. It’s been like this in most groups I’ve gone to that’s left-leaning.
> 
> This post is already too long, but here's a quick aside. These experiences have generally frustrated me especially as someone who does not tell everyone every aspect of my identity. I’m mostly white but my racial/ethnic background is complicated due to family trauma. I’m bisexual and in a polyamorous relationship but my girlfriend is in the closet. I am passionate about drug laws and reproductive rights due to more family trauma/past experiences that I generally don’t want to talk about unless it’s with close friends and family. I’ve both talked to other people who have quit groups/lowered their involvement because of these attitudes and I’ve been that person myself.
> 
> Tl;dr Misapplication of identity politics is more an issue than IBDK gives credit to. It’s less of an issue than structural racism but is still more of a problem than a few random people saying silly things.

	I think a consistent through line with a lot of Michael's work has been the *materiality* of social concerns. You see this throughout his three podcasts: his attitude towards stranger danger in YWA, his thoughts on obesity comorbidities in Maintenance Phase, and now here in IBCK. Michael's consistent position has been, "These things happen on some scale, but the scale on which they happen isn't significant to the day-to-day lives of most people."

	So yeah, your experience - on what sounds like a college campus - sounds like it involves a lot of identity politics every day. But there aren't a lot of Americans preoccupied with college culture, in the same way that you don't see a lot of national outcries over underaged drinking or skipping class. What is meaningful in that insular bubble isn't necessarily meaningful to everyone else.

	And I think critically, what you're describing is leftists policing themselves. They aren't passing laws to limit free speech, or voting rights, or religious freedom. They aren't buying Twitter to shut down political opponents. They aren't electing leftist dictators. The biggest manifestation of leftist power in the last decade has been unionizing Starbucks.

	So what Michael and Peter are getting at is that convoluted internal leftist small-scale politics are real, but not really significant. The hand-wringing about identity politics is really just conservatives being mad that people are asking racial minorities for their opinions now. Everything else is theater.

	* 🟨 **[jamincan](https://www.reddit.com/user/jamincan)** ⬆️ 12 _(2023-12-19 02:27:50)_

		I disagree that criticism of identity politics is just conservatives being mad. There should be a way for the left to engage with itself on issues within the left without parties being dismissed as conservative instigators or being gaslighted that their concerns aren't real.

	* 🟨 **[Banana_Skirt](https://www.reddit.com/user/Banana_Skirt) (OP)** ⬆️ 17 _(2023-12-18 17:11:52)_

		That last part is what I disagree with and is one of the few areas where I find myself generally disagreeing with Michael.
		
		I agree that the scale is much smaller but not that it's insignificant. I think it's true that many conservatives focus too much time complaining about silly examples of identity politics rather than addressing fundamental problems related to safety, housing, daily living etc. However, I also think it's true that this is a problem that continually shows up in leftist circles and has real implications for organizing, effecting political change, and making a difference both in these circles and more broadly.
		
		For example, I mention the segregated racial justice groups in my department. The clumsy handling of identity politics resulted in no actual effort happening toward investigating and addressing racial disparities in the department. Instead, one group disbanded and the other one turned into a reading club.
		
		Mostly I get frustrated feeling like the only people who talk about this are conservatives and grifters or leftists who either deny this ever happens or say it's not a problem because it doesn't happen the way grifters say it happens.

		* 🟧 **[AntiqueSunrise](https://www.reddit.com/user/AntiqueSunrise)** ⬆️ 42 _(2023-12-18 17:42:57)_

			Sure. But what is the impact of that department not addressing racial disparities at the granularity it seeks to affect? Compare whatever that is to, for example, Democratic efforts to increase college access through Pell Grants, or Republican efforts to ban diversity considerations from admissions standards.
			
			Republicans identity politics happen on a national scale. Liberals engage in their social policy efforts at a national scale. Leftists fighting leftists over a book club is real, but not material to a discussion of large-scale political or social trends.

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 16 _(2023-12-19 00:06:08)_

				I'd say that not only is it immaterial, but that focusing on it is just carrying water for Republicans.

				Just because one thing is at a bigger scale doesn't mean the other thing isn't an issue. It wasn't supposed to be a book club and that's the point. 
				
				This is helping me clarify one reason why this bothers me so much.
				
				People say that leftist internal politics doesn't matter because leftists don't have much power. That internal fighting is part of the reason we don't have power.

				* 🟪 **[jeudechambre](https://www.reddit.com/user/jeudechambre)** ⬆️ 16 _(2023-12-19 05:15:11)_

					"That internal fighting is part of the reason we don't have power" &lt;--- agreed! a little bit of self-critique is important, but as someone who is involved with leftist organizing circles, I have also seen it get out of hand at times. 
					
					Similar to your anecdote, I was organizing a speaker's list for a rally, and a straight/cis/white male who I asked to speak (along with many other speakers), told me he "generally tries not to speak at rallies because of his identity". I was genuinely confused at first and asked "wait Topher -- are you on the run from the law or something?? trying to stay incognito??", but he explained that he meant straight white male, LOL. He had some of the most specific expertise on the legislation we were promoting at the rally, so I thought it was pretty silly that he self-censored. 
					
					I think that in these organizing spaces, it's obviously important to have racial diversity, but to me it gets silly when the energy is spent on trying to make things look a certain way at a rally, instead of thinking more strategically about, ok, why is our movement base not as racially diverse as we need it to be, and how can we intentionally reach out to new and different communities.
					
					So yeah, I want to hold the nuance you expressed in your post! Because I don't think you're being reactionary or saying that these activist spaces should not pay attention to identity at all -- just that the circular firing squads can get out of hand sometimes, and genuinely cause activist groups to fall apart/lose momentum when the parties involved should have been able to work through the conflict together. I think as leftists we need to work on staying with each other and keeping our eyes on the larger goal THROUGH conflict, but that's a whole other topic.

					* 🟥 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 4 _(2023-12-20 18:56:38)_

						>ok, why is our movement base not as racially diverse as we need it to be
						
						Oh, that's easy. Because the white guys who put themselves out there as authorities and experts get asked to speak at the rallies and to lead the community. Your friend Topher gets it and is stepping back instead of agreeing every time the default is "hey let's ask Topher, who we think of as a leader in part because he's a straight while dude".

					Some of the reason for the difference of opinion may be audience. Internal leftist conversations about how to best organize are genuinely useful. But, those conversations don’t need to be national and occur within centrist or right circles (a high profile part of the conversation atm). There have always been conversations within activist groups about how to best achieve goals, but I don’t believe those conversations have been as high profile outside of the relevant circles before now which allowed for more complex and useful conversations.

				* 🟪 **[BaseTensMachine](https://www.reddit.com/user/BaseTensMachine)** ⬆️ 11 _(2023-12-18 21:41:32)_

					I agree with your last sentence but surely you can see the difference in scale? And I don't think Michael or the person you're replying to would say it's unimportant, it's just, think of the context. If you wrote an article getting really into the problematic infighting on the left, you know the right would eat it up and broadcast it everywhere. Surely you can see that's informing some of the light handedness or refusal to engage more on the subject.

			I think what you’re describing is the messy experimentation that is the college/graduate education experience. It turns out that inexperienced, partially educated, and hungover students aren’t that effective in organizing. But that’s not a bad thing. Talk to any experienced, effective organizers and they’ll tell you these experiences taught them what not to do, and were necessary to learn how to cooperate.
			
			I’m not saying that these experiences of identity politics dissolving progressive movements isn’t real—just that it’s kind of part of the process. And it’s a fairly safe environment to exercise these ideas—which is the point of an academic institution.
			
			Keep exploring more effective methods! Sit with the discomfort of your efforts falling apart. And recognize that this is nothing new. We don’t hear the stories of failed revolutions the way we hear about the successful ones.

				this was my immediate reaction to all those examples too - our authoritarian institutions have grown overwhelming, we acclimate students to them from before their memory begins, isolate them in these prisons where we yell at them for talking to one another, feed them propagandized history lessons, provide them no useful tools for working against any of these systems....and then when they start learning about a bunch of this stuff  for themselves of *course* they want to do something about it!  so they finally get to college and they try to figure it out.  and there are often zero resources or elders helping them to figure this out, and on top of that college is more isolating and pressurizing than ever, it's just highschool 2.0 now, so they have a bullshit paper due on something they don't care about, and a math test they don't understand, and all these Big Feelings about a world on fire!
				
				there are no serious or depthful seminar courses on effective activism, with papers where you can debated the merits of the theory and workshops where you read each other's work and talk about praxis.  hell, even half the explicit "Gender Studies" courses out there are scarce reviews of outdated anthologies that can't effectively build the kind of comprehension needed to coordinate and grow and work towards meaningful change.
				
				capitalist realism looms more ubiquitous than ever, while leftist discourse is more scattered and obfuscated than ever.  how are we gonna blame a bunch of college kids for trying to figure this shit out on the fly?

					It seems like you’ve been in some harmful educational environments. And from your post history it looks like you’re also a teacher in secondary education. I can imagine you have a lot of thoughts and feelings on this topic.
					
					My higher educational experiences weren’t as bad as you described (but I believe people that did have these issues). My main point is that ideally, higher education coincides with this developmental stage where people are gaining more knowledge about the world around them and trying out new skills. It’s also always been a time of intensity, and that is a formula for organizational breakdowns. I think it’s important to keep in mind that failures like this can be the groundwork for future success, and don’t just mean missed opportunities.

		* 🟧 **[gayandspooky](https://www.reddit.com/user/gayandspooky)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-12-19 07:42:23)_

			Identity politics are a pendulum. Previously, in a time before the proliferation of the internet, we had a monoculture where there was one main identity and the other fringe identities which received only minor notice. If you were any kind of a minority, enjoy watching and consiming only entertainment about white men your entire life with maybe one token person thrown in for comedic effect. Now, we live in a time where everyone can find their people and so the voices of minority groups has been amplified to feel like it is equal in size to the majority group, even if it’s representing a relatively small portion of the population.
			
			The pendulum has now swung to, perhaps, too extreme of “acceptance” which can read as discrimination, especially by those who have never actually experienced that before. I think it’s shocking to experience it for the first time. However, it will correct as the novelty dies down. 
			
			I’m gay and I watch the hetero world hilariously overcorrect and try to be as PC as possible around me. Is it annoying? Sure. Do I prefer the times of open discrimination? Fuck NO. I like not being openly shit on by the world around me (crazy, right?). I know it will settle down and we’ll find a medium eventually, so don’t get your panties in such a twist over it. It’s a relatively minor inconvenience in your life and getting overly upset over it is what conservative groups want, instead if focusing on actual problems in our country that need to be fixed while they pocket bribe money to sell off our democracy.

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-22 07:58:21)_

				Your middle paragraph is totally wrong. I like a lot of the rest of this, but there is no pendulum swing in any material way. Multiple states literally have laws in the works targeting trans people. 
				
				You need to show how that pendulum has swung, or you're just doing the exact thing this book they're criticizing is doing.
				
				People confuse Twitter and anecdotal evidence with actual material power, which is just objectively incorrect. We can imagine a world where that changes, but we aren't even *close* to that yet. The Republican frontrunner for president *literally* tried to ban trans people from being in the military. 
				
				It's just bonkers to say that society has become *too* accepting. Maybe your progressive friends are annoyingly PC, but that means basically nothing.

				* 🟪 **[gayandspooky](https://www.reddit.com/user/gayandspooky)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-12-22 09:08:49)_

					I agree, and as a Floridian, I’m all too familiar with those laws and have done my part to rally against them. What I mean when I say “too accepting” is to speak to the cultural ethos going on right now in our popular culture and talk from the perspective of those who are bothered by it. 
					
					Do -I- believe it’s genuinely too accepting? No. Does it feel obnoxiously cloying to see gay and trans people used as props to virtue signal by large corporations? Incredibly. And I think what a lot of angry people are reacting to is the very sudden over-inundation of this into our culture. 
					
					Believe me, I’d love to see MORE gay content in the mainstream (as long as it’s genuine), but I’m a realist and I understand that the rest of the world does change it’s mind somewhat slowly.

			I think the thing is the institutionality of the problem. Maybe that's better than "material effect". You're right that this behavior can affect things like organizing, but I also think leftists miscalculate the actual effect of this behavior. 
			
			The right is always going to find the blue hair extremist, so mellowing out the blue hair extremist is not going to work. They'll just make one up if it's not there.
			
			You could be the coolest, reaching across the aisle-est people, but a bad faith opponent is a bad faith opponent. 
			
			Of all your concerns my biggest is that the group-Identity thing is discouraging people from outside groups to support. You never really saw any white people on the front lines of BLM but you saw white people everywhere in 50s/60s era protests, and that's a thing I really wondered about.

			College students were saying nutty things when I was in college decades ago. As far as I know, none of those 19-year-old commies turned into 40-year-old commies. College is where young people explore their political beliefs in a small, insulated environment before they become adults with jobs and rent payments and responsibilities that eventually grind them down into run-of-the-mill NIMBY left-leaning centrists.

								From what I remember it was going to be like that at every meeting.
								
								I'm okay with the concept of asking a group of people to just sit and listen for a session or part of a meeting. I'm also okay with bluntly talking about how white people need to be mindful about dominating conversations and taking people aside if they do that.
								
								What bothered me about the concept of white people only coming to the meetings in silent solidarity is logistical and theoretical. Just on the logistics side, if you want someone to understand something then they need space to ask questions and get clarification. I also don't think you can address racial issues by excluding white people from the conversation otherwise it's putting all the work of solving racism onto POC. That was the argument someone else made but then they made it a white accountability group, which was not the best solution to say the least.
								
								Theoretically, I'm also iffy of creating a situation where we have to define whiteness so strictly. It's relevant that this was a sociology department so we're really big on social constructionism. A pale person of British or German decent is clearly white. But what about someone who is from the Middle East. Or if they are Latino and look such a way that whether they are white depends on the country/culture/group they are in. Or what if you are mixed race white (including being white passing)? 
								
								Obligatory remark that race being a social construction has nothing to do with the material effects of racism. Just that I think saying "if you are white then you shouldn't speak" erases this complexity and forces people to clearly state they shouldn't speak or they should. This is the part I relate to because I am mixed yet white passing and have often felt this bind where I don't want to participate in conversations where I don't belong but also don't want to deny my non-whiteness just because of how genetics happened to work out.
								
								I think other ways of formatting the meeting where you focus on experiences, identity and action, while making sure privileged people don't dominate the conversation, can allow for this nuance and open up the conversation in a more productive way.

		I don’t agree with this framing that identity politics is harmless bc it’s only used by people in powerless spaces. You’d have to be living underneath a rock to not be touched by identity politics in one of its many manifestations. That was political correctness in the 2010s to BLM to much of the anti-racist/CRT rhetoric we have now. 
		
		Where I live in NorCal, many of our laws and elected officials are chosen on the basis of their progressive bonafides. So much so that certain DAs (Boudin, Pam Price) have been facing recalls bc of rising crime rates in response to lax new laws around shoplifting and petty crimes. 
		
		These conversations around leftist ideas like decolonization, anti racism, and equity have prompted many corporations to establish DEI boards, companies now have their own policies on issues like abortion, trans rights, and go so far as to create funds for employees to use for travel to pro-choice states or funding for transitioning employees. 
		
		These conversations are happening at scale and influencing culture, ethics, laws etc in a huge way. BLM went from college protests to a global movement that put POC in positions of power in ways we’ve never seen before.

There are a lot of second and third generation immigrants in the US who are Latino/a/x and don’t speak Spanish but I don’t think that should mean they can’t claim a Latino/a/x identity. If you don’t want to use it, it’s fine but it seems silly to not use a term English speakers created for themselves specifically because Spanish speakers don’t use it.

						I feel like none of the variation of words using x that people were trying for a while ever really caught on. They’re just awkward and no one knows how to pronounce them. And then a new word emerges more organically and/or the discourse on the word/topic evolves and we all move on. But somehow a lot of people got stuck in the “stop trying to make fetch happen” stage with Latinx long past anyone actually trying to use the word.

		That said, I think universities will always sway towards the extremes of popular liberal ideas, because young students tend to be passionate, personally engaged, and have the time and incentive to really grapple with new ideas. 
		
		- I’m always wondering how true this is, or whether it’s another right wing talking point about college campuses. There are ample data about how all voters feel about political beliefs on college campuses ([they’re too liberal](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/08/19/the-growing-partisan-divide-in-views-of-higher-education-2/)), but when I’ve looked, there is a surprising lack of data on what political beliefs college students actually hold. [This](https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2021/11/24/some_surprising_facts_about_college_students_politics_804971.amp.html) is the closest thing I’ve found, which is a center-right think tank that suggests that more than 50% of college students consider themselves as independents, around ~30% democrats and ~10% republicans. It’s weird that our political discourse centers college campuses in re: identity politics so often and yet no one has bothered to see what the majority of students think. 
		
		I guess I’m just thinking about the scale out loud here, and I think this is part of Michael and Peter’s point: while there will always be anecdotes about political correctness and identity politics on college campuses, it’s hard to say that that’s the majority of what’s going on there. 
		
		As an extended sidebar, I fear that part of the problem is that it doesn’t matter how tame the left gets about identity politics or whether we go “too far”: the actual amount of identity politics that is acceptable on the right is zero. I don’t know that people on the left would say that having a DEI office is identity politics run amok, and yet the state of Oklahoma has just [banned](https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/14/oklahoma-ban-diversity-dei-program-colleges) state-funded DEI efforts.

				However, it is interesting to me that none of this discussion points out that conservatives have their own “political correctness” on campus too - the reactionary, performative racism, the anti-anti-sexism marches, etc.

	I had similar thoughts, but more around the examples that were in the book! The absolute implosion of the Women’s March as an organization is absolutely the example I would use if I were writing a book on this topic. An event that mobilized hundreds of thousands of women across the country became an organization where identity politics infighting made it a joke.

	I went to a vigil while Baisley-Ford was testifying and it ended with a smaller March from the Capitol to the Supreme Court, or something like that. I left when the organizers said that white women who were sexual assault victims should March behind Black women regardless of whether they’ve been assaulted.

		I pretty much stopped attending political rallies in my city after going to a vigil for Heather Heyer, the white woman who was run over by a car at the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville.  The main speaker spent the entire time yelling about "Becky's", meaning white women activists, and everything they are doing wrong in the activist movement.

I think everyone should be aware of how these ideas can be used in a counterproductive and bad faith manner. I think panic about them is overblown, especially by conservatives, and I don't think they drive many people right, but they do create a lot of obstacles to organizing. I think Walter Benn Michael's Trouble With Diversity is a good read for those of us on the left, as unlike Monk's book it's not aimed at conservatives.

	Not that I don’t broadly agree with them and their worldview, but it has been a pretty big running problem the way they will downplay social problems in leftist circles that really harm group cohesion. Michael’s first video on YouTube talks about why cancel culture isn’t real, and one of his primary examples of something being blown out of proportion is how Amelie Wen Zhao’s career was supposedly ruined, when in his opinion it’s fine actually. He could not have possibly picked a worse example. Her career absolutely was ruined over nothing. That book didn’t come close to earning back its advance. Even ignoring whether the publisher wants to market a sequel (which they did not — I only now just discovered that they’re even was one released and I bought the first book in hardcover), he seems incapable of taking into account the personal damage the sort of campaigns do the people on an individual level that have a chilling effect. I understand why they are the way they are wrt debunking right wing narratives, but they are generally pretty dismissive of this particular Blindspot, and that video still makes me have a hard time taking him seriously.

		Like, saying Chapelle was “cancelled” for being a transphobe is just an outright lie, people just called him out for being an out of touch asshole but he’s doing fine. But saying that like, the author of Love, Simon didn’t face so much harassment that she was forced out of the closet because people were so angry that a woman they perceived as straight wrote a queer romance is also a lie.

	I think I get what you're saying. That the term has been misapplied and watered down by some to where even the term is not used properly by well-meaning folks.

	My issue with the "left" (afaic liberals and even progressives in the United States are left, the latter of the two would be centrist on a global scale imo, but socialists of various persuasions as well) is that it takes what the right bastardizes from leftist or marginalized community spaces, and functionally operates from the bastardized version instead of the original term. Identity politics is probably the most prominent example as almost no one uses it in the context in which (queer socialist) Black women of the Combahee River Collective used it in the 70s. It's commonly seen as Representation Politics=Identity Politics in the mainstream and by many who have a passing or those who claim to have a "deep" familiarity with the term.

	As far as some of the examples you mentioned, I don't necessarily have a problem with. I think it's strategically necessary for (relationally) non-marginalized folks to organize amongst themselves to some extent before helping marginalized ppl. This is contextual, of course, but useful. For example, white allies to organize themselves and other white people before doing mass organizing with Black folks, and this is something that goes back to the 60s and Kwame Ture's observation of a subservient tendency within SNCC spaces that Black folks had to white participants that hampered progess in some regards. "Hillbilly Nationalists, Urban Race Rebels, and Black Power" has chapters that go into great detail about how white folks that were organizing for the Rainbow Coalition 🌈✊🏾  went about it in an organic way that was inspiring.

	If not for Black women being able to organize in their own spaces (largely in part due to the ostracization they faced by white women and Black men in organizing spaces during the 60s and 70s) we wouldn't have the concepts of identity politics and instersectionality at our disposal. That's not to say they weren't operating within those frameworks beforehand (Black women political praxis are inherently invoking the two when working as a collective), but the phrasing, the naming of these realities, wouldn't be as impactful.

	I will say that the sloppiness of the separation between the groups you alluded to, as well as the other examples, such as folks having issues with a gay man running the gender studies space, is indicative of a bastardized version of identity politics, as well as a misuse of strategic essentialism (Spivak) and a telephone game version of standpoint theory (Harding).I've taught gender studies and I usually haven't had much pushback from my femme comrades and colleagues as a queer man, so that an identity precludes one from understanding theory is a bit shortsighted in some regards. Not to mention queer theory is inherently a part of modern gender analysis to where excluding LGBTQ+ folks is pretty damn difficult, including cis men who are that (tho I'm obviously respectful of my lesbian/trans friends who want their own spaces).

	I've been in spaces where these separation of identity groups don't materialize to actual tangible goals because they turn onto cliques, but that isn't unique to leftist circles. Frankly, it comes from folks who don't have much experience organizing, or at least not a good understanding of the histories of these movements, their successes, and failures.

	That being said, I can see Michael and Peter downplaying it because it is not the same tier as harmful as people in power misappropriating concepts like Identity Politics and Intersectionality. Which is true, but I don't think it could hurt to explain why its misuse by the leftist community/ies can be addressed to a degree as well....

	The reason these identity politics issues come up in colleges and universities is that it used to be heavily cis white men. Now by the numbers there is more diversity. But people still found that cis white men had more power through all kinds of tactics, some overt and some unconscious biases. So now in that setting there is a focus on finding policies that can change the balance of power. This makes conservatives lose their shit because they don’t like policies that question their power. I don’t know that the identity politics have gone too far so much as they are well intentioned but not thought through.

	Thank you for sharing these experiences and noticing that they're a little \*off.\* We have a few very identity-forward people in local politics here and they at times do things that I think are a little inappropriate...very #girlboss. I heard a rumor that identity politics was astroturfed to fuck up the Occupy movement, and while I have no evidence, I wouldn't be surprised.

	I really liked how Michael framed the argument surrounding the "black class" anecdote. Nobody is forcing white and black students back into different schools, or talking about doing anything like that. "It's giving segregation," yes, but it's just a genuine attempt to creatively solve for a policy failure.

	As far as people using identity as sort of de facto credentials...no, it's not \*fair\* that it would be easier for a woman or POC to win a leadership position in your socialist example, but this might be needed in order to create a fair \*outcome\* where the group is representative of its membership and welcoming to marginalized people, and focused on issues that affect marginalized people, which is the entire point of being progressive. DSAs are notoriously overpopulated with 22 year old white men, even though most progressives are not. And if someone is \*marginalized,\* by definition it requires active effort to get them to the center of attention. Conservatives don't have this problem at all... I think they can simply fight each other for control and it fits within their framework.

	The elephant in the room is that when anyone identifies with a non-white race, ethnicity, heritage, culture, etc, it's great, but when white people identify with whiteness, it's a nightmare. There needs to be an option for being a good white person, even if you're not poor, so we can stop playing the oppression Olympics. But I really think that has to come from from within and should come from white people talking to other white people. Obviously... who else is going to create a big (pink) Box of Acceptance for me to step into? No straight people ever made one for LGBT, no white people ever made one for Black people...

	I cannot argue with the idea that we really need white progressive men to step up and teach white conservative men that it's okay to be a white man, either. People literally thought the Barbie movie was anti-man. Just... no.

	Two things, one of which is probably going to get me dog-piled, but will be worth it:

	A - what you're talking about, the downplaying of how common it is, really reflects another time I had an issue with that same attitude in Maintenance Phase. They dismissed ever seeing a "militant vegan" who was mean, and attributed it to meat-eaters feeling guilty. Meanwhile, I've seen a black disabled activist get immediately attacked and degraded by vegans when she like....*mentioned* cheese. Just because it's not directed at you, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

	B - completely divorcing disagreement and conflict of the actual conduct of Israel, the IDF, etc going on right now...**identity politics has allowed terrifying amounts of virulent antisemitism and terrorism endorsement into progressive and leftist spaces.** 

	It's "Jews = white, Palestinians=brown. therefore Jews are oppressors and any form of resistance or violence against them is valid." My FYP is full of progressive and leftist tiktokers. After 10/7, it was a flood of celebrating murder and vicious SA of civilians. A week ago I had to unfollow someone if followed for their social justice takes, because they were engaging in rape denialism. 

	IRL Pro-Palestinian activists are attacking and screaming death threats at Jews, and it's all justified in their brains by identity politics.

If we're just comparing anecdotes, I know like 30 vegan people and not a single one has ever been militant to me or anyone else about it. However, almost every time they mention their diet (almost always in regard to going out to a shared meal) someone has something to say. 
		
		B- Again, you need to show data on this. You can't just say, "leftists are now anti-Semitic."
		
		A shit ton of stuff I keep seeing called "anti-Semitic" is just people criticizing Israel engaging in genocide.

	Your anecdotes still consist of extremely minor and nebulous incidents with no material consequences. You say some local feminists “freaked out?” Did they like, publicly dismember a chicken and cover themselves in the blood? Or by “freaked out,” do you mean there was generalized chattering that you found annoying because you were involved in the situation? Meanwhile, actual laws and policies increasingly reflect deeply-rooted reactionary and revanchist sentiments. Books like this are designed and marketed to capture the hearts and minds of people who otherwise consider themselves progressive, but are turned off by the chaos and discomfort that naturally accompany progress, centering their own experience over justice. In other words, you!

	My suggestion would be to put on your big-kid pants. “Leftist” spaces might be annoying and uncomfortable to you, but they are the only safe havens for many, many others, in ways that are invisible and/or unimportant to you. I lived in the rural mountain west until fairly recently. In 2021, I was still getting screamed at in the street by regressive rednecks who hate to see a woman with short hair. Away from “leftist” spaces, racists and bigots are only getting bolder, and are empowered by mainstream discourse. Have you looked at an electoral map or listened to the rhetoric of right-wing and center pundits and politicians? Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health? 303 Creative v. Elenis? SFFA v. Harvard and UNC? As much discomfort as we might experience by being asked to stop centering white (though apparently your whiteness has somehow been diluted through “trauma”? mmkay.) perspectives in academic and political spaces, that discomfort and frustration does not hold a candle to the material consequences of fanning these neoreactionist flames. 

	Your local socialist group has annoying tendencies. Oh noes!! Have you thought about, I don’t know, getting a grip?

	I think Peter and Michael would say that the illiberal left is a problem - especially on college campuses - but that it's not the bugaboo the reactionary centrists (aka, Republicans) think it is. Essentially, they aren't denying the existence of the illiberal left, but saying the attention paid to the illiberal left is oversized, compared to the actual impact it's having on society.

	The illiberal left is a problem, though, and it's the worst on college campuses. I mostly blame admin and, to a lesser extent, faculty for abdicated their roles as trusted adults to college kids. College students are histrionic, absolutist, idealistic, and illiberal. It's just a developmental norm and also encourage in the university environment. There's really nothing wrong with students trying out these ideas. However, students need trusted adults in the room to guide them to more solutions-oriented, liberal thinking. Instead, all of these university admins have chosen instead to hop on the illiberal bandwagon, which leads to cult-like thinking.

	And, so much of illiberal leftist culture is about the performativity of superficial virtue. People love to throw on the veneer of D&amp;I language and apply it to already durable concepts. It's a problem, and it undermines the credibility of true solutions-based discussion of liberal equality. 

	Many of the examples you give have practical reasoning hiding underneath the culty, performative language:

	1. It's not helpful for mostly white people to improve Students' of Color experiences in your department. It's admirable you all wanted to help, but it won't actually help POC for the committee to be all white. They could have asked, perhaps, first generation white students or students with disabilities to participate. They could have solicited more participation from students of color by paying them to do the work. The White Accountability group as an alternative is a weird, performative choice.

	2. Outside of a social justice context, I can see why this informal rule about talking about your own sexuality might exist. Heterosexuality IS a sexuality, and so many hetero people are guilty of seeing it as a default. Gender and sexuality classes function much better when we don't default to examining only the "non-normative" identity and are able to consider heterosexuality as contrived as homosexuality. I think there's more benefit to the student and to society as a whole for straight students to apply the concepts learned in class to one's own identity than to some distant "other". However, framing this discussion in terms of performative social justice gatekeeping is reductive.

	3. Same as #2. Also, you hit on the main issue.

	4. Events can't have too many speakers or no one pays attention. I think this is an example of either performative social justice OR it's conflict avoidance. They didn't want to give you meaningful feedback about their decision, so they used social justice performance as a thought terminating cliche.

	5. This is a REAL strategy for increasing diversity in leadership, but perhaps there's a lesson for how to market it.

	6. This is bullshit and so retrograde.

	Here are some people talking about the illiberal left:

	1. ContraPoints (I'd start with Cancelling and Envy)

	2. John McWhorter

	3. Jay Caspian Kang

	4. The End of Bias by Jessica Nordell

		Really?? John McWhorter is exactly the type of reactionary centrist grifter who could have his own episode on IBCK
		
		Contrapoints isn't as bad, but her thoughts on cancel culture differ significantly from Michael's from what I've seen, (and she's got some weird leftist-reactionary currents under a few of her views, though lots of her stuff is great)
		
		I don't know the other two.
		
		sure, the "illiberal left" may exist in examples here and there, but like you point out in your list, is often just a name for young people applying parts of social justice clumsily in ways that don't actually help. but that seems mostly like a "young people sometimes embrace principles they don't yet deeply understand" thing rather than a  problem with significant political power in the U.S.
		
		and like, from what I've heard on 5-4, I don't think Peter even identifies as liberal; he's seems to pretty plainly be leftist.

			Are we not saying the same thing? I’m not sure what you’re upset about. I literally said it’s college kids being college kids. The problem is the adults in the room who are not guiding college kids against illiberalism. 
			
			I don’t think John McWhorter or ContraPoints are perfect or geniuses, but I think they are some of the few voices on the left who are critiquing the illiberal left in good faith. The illiberal shit can feel like an echo chamber on a college campus, so I wanted to provide OP with a handful of writers who are discussing this. 
			
			Also, I mean liberal in the classical sense, as in the opposite of illiberal. Not the political sense.

	I do think this is fairly an academic thing. I joined a book club pre covid and just happened to be one of the only non-professors in the group from a local university. There were distinct differences in how they spoke about different diversity topics, compared to how I spoke. It all felt so forced and sanitized from their end, and it made me overanalyze every word they said/made me feel like a total outsider.

	Although I myself have not seen things like that in higher ed currently, I think it is common to have a "DEI Office" that promotes this or that event during the year, and some courses are tagged as "DEI" as well.  And maybe it all varies by program and discipline?  Sociology vs. rocket science? 

	But I recall taking a cross-disciplinary grad class that included "break out" discussion groups by race/ethnicity and sex/gender, so it is not a brand new idea or educational practice. 

	That said, although I support DEI in principle, I find it tends to address race/ethnicity and sex/gender, than comes to a half.  In theory, other things like disability and age should be included, but often are not.  And as the OP mentioned, non-monogamy/polyamorous tend not to even make it on the DEI "issues list."  I'd even add neurodivergence and personality type as possible issues to also be added.
