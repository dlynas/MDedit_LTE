## Biography [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C._L._R._James&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")

### Early life in Trinidad [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C._L._R._James&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Early life in Trinidad")

Born in 1901 in [Tunapuna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunapuna "Tunapuna"), [Trinidad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad "Trinidad"), then a [British Crown colony](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"), C. L. R. James was the first child of Ida Elizabeth James (née Rudder)<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> and Robert Alexander James, a schoolteacher.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

In 1910, James won a scholarship to [Queen's Royal College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Royal_College "Queen's Royal College") (QRC), the island's oldest non-Catholic secondary school, in [Port of Spain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Spain "Port of Spain"), where he became a club cricketer and distinguished himself as an athlete (he held the Trinidad high-jump record at 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) from 1918 to 1922), as well as beginning to write fiction.<sup id="cite_ref-IntroARV_10-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-IntroARV-10">[10]</a></sup> After graduating in 1918 from QRC, he worked there as a teacher of English and History in the 1920s;<sup id="cite_ref-IntroARV_10-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-IntroARV-10">[10]</a></sup> among those he taught was the young [Eric Williams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Williams "Eric Williams"), who became the first [Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago "Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago").

Together with [Ralph de Boissière](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_de_Boissi%C3%A8re "Ralph de Boissière"), [Albert Gomes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Gomes "Albert Gomes") and [Alfred Mendes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Mendes "Alfred Mendes"), James was a member of the [anticolonialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-imperialism "Anti-imperialism") "Beacon Group", a circle of writers associated with _[The Beacon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beacon_(magazine) "The Beacon (magazine)")_ magazine, in which he published a series of short stories.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> His short story "La Divina Pastora" was published in October 1927 in the _[Saturday Review of Literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Review_of_Literature "Saturday Review of Literature")_,<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> and was widely reprinted.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

### British years [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C._L._R._James&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: British years")

In 1932, James left Trinidad for the small town of [Nelson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson,_Lancashire "Nelson, Lancashire") in [Lancashire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire "Lancashire"), England, at the invitation of his friend, West Indian cricketer [Learie Constantine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learie_Constantine "Learie Constantine"), who needed his help writing his autobiography _Cricket and I_ (published in 1933).<sup id="cite_ref-Grimshaw_15-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-Grimshaw-15">[15]</a></sup> James had brought with him to England the manuscript of his first full-length non-fiction work, partly based on his interviews with the Trinidad labour leader [Arthur Andrew Cipriani](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Andrew_Cipriani "Arthur Andrew Cipriani"), which was published with financial assistance from Constantine in 1932.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

During this time, James took a job as cricket correspondent with _[The Manchester Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")_.<sup id="cite_ref-Grimshaw_15-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-Grimshaw-15">[15]</a></sup> In 1933, he moved to [London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London"). The following year, he joined a [Trotskyist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyist "Trotskyist") group that met to talk for hours in his rented room. [Louise Cripps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Cripps "Louise Cripps"), one of its members, recalled: "We felt our work could contribute to the time when we would see Socialism spreading."

James had begun to campaign for the independence of the [West Indies](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies "West Indies") while in Trinidad. An abridged version of his _Life of Captain Cipriani_ was issued by [Leonard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Woolf "Leonard Woolf") and [Virginia Woolf](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf "Virginia Woolf")'s [Hogarth Press](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogarth_Press "Hogarth Press") in 1933 as the pamphlet _The Case for West-Indian Self Government_.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> He became a champion of [Pan-Africanism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Africanism "Pan-Africanism"), and was named Chair of the [International African Friends of Abyssinia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_African_Friends_of_Abyssinia "International African Friends of Abyssinia"), later renamed the International African Friends of Ethiopia (IAFE)<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> – a group formed in 1935 in response to the [Italian fascist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fascism "Italian fascism") invasion of [Ethiopia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia "Ethiopia") (the [Second Italo-Ethiopian War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War "Second Italo-Ethiopian War")). Leading members included [Amy Ashwood Garvey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Ashwood_Garvey "Amy Ashwood Garvey"), [Jomo Kenyatta](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jomo_Kenyatta "Jomo Kenyatta") and [Chris Braithwaite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Braithwaite "Chris Braithwaite").

When the IAFE was transformed into the [International African Service Bureau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_African_Service_Bureau "International African Service Bureau") in 1937, James edited its newsletter, _Africa and the World_, and its journal, _International African Opinion_. The Bureau was led by his childhood friend [George Padmore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Padmore "George Padmore"), who became a driving force for socialist Pan-Africanism for several decades. Both Padmore and James wrote for the _New Leader_, published by the [Independent Labour Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Labour_Party "Independent Labour Party") (ILP), which James had joined in 1934 (when [Fenner Brockway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenner_Brockway "Fenner Brockway") was its General Secretary).<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

James in 1938

In 1934, James wrote a three-act play about the Haitian revolutionary [Toussaint Louverture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture "Toussaint Louverture") (entitled _[Toussaint Louverture: The Story of the Only Successful Slave Revolt in History](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture:_The_Story_of_the_Only_Successful_Slave_Revolt_in_History "Toussaint Louverture: The Story of the Only Successful Slave Revolt in History")_), which was staged in London's [West End](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre "West End theatre") in 1936 and starred [Paul Robeson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Robeson "Paul Robeson"), [Orlando Martins](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Martins "Orlando Martins"), [Robert Adams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Adams_(actor) "Robert Adams (actor)") and [Harry Andrews](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Andrews "Harry Andrews").<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> The play had been presumed lost until the rediscovery of a draft copy in 2005, the play has now gone on to be adapted into a graphic novel by Nic Watts and Sakina Karimjee.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> In 1967, James went on to write a second play about the Haitian Revolution, _The Black Jacobins_, which became the first production from [Talawa Theatre Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talawa_Theatre_Company "Talawa Theatre Company") in 1986, coinciding with the overthrow of [Jean-Claude Duvalier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Duvalier "Jean-Claude Duvalier").<sup id="cite_ref-auto_24-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-auto-24">[24]</a></sup> 1936 also saw [Secker & Warburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secker_%26_Warburg "Secker & Warburg") in London publish James's novel, _[Minty Alley](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minty_Alley "Minty Alley")_, which he had brought with him in manuscript form from Trinidad.<sup id="cite_ref-Grimshaw_15-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-Grimshaw-15">[15]</a></sup> (Fenner Brockway had introduced him to [Fredric Warburg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Warburg "Fredric Warburg"), co-owner of the press.)<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> It was the first novel to be published by a black Caribbean author in the UK.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

Amid his frenetic political activity, James wrote what are perhaps his best known works of non-fiction: _[World Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Revolution_(book) "World Revolution (book)")_ (1937), a history of the rise and fall of the [Communist International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_International "Communist International"), which was critically praised by [Leon Trotsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky "Leon Trotsky"), [George Orwell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell "George Orwell"), [E. H. Carr](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._H._Carr "E. H. Carr") and Fenner Brockway;<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> and _[The Black Jacobins: Toussaint L'Ouverture and the San Domingo Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Jacobins "The Black Jacobins")_ (1938), a widely acclaimed history of the [Haitian Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution "Haitian Revolution"), which was later seen as a seminal text in the study of the [African diaspora](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_diaspora "African diaspora"). James went to [Paris](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris "Paris") to research this work, where he met Haitian military historian [Alfred Auguste Nemours](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Auguste_Nemours "Alfred Auguste Nemours"). In a new foreword to the 1980 [Allison & Busby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allison_%26_Busby "Allison & Busby") edition of _The Black Jacobins_, James recalled that "Nemours used coffee cups and books in Paris cafés to bring to life the military skills of revolutionary Haitians."<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

In 1936, James and his Trotskyist [Marxist Group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_Group_(UK) "Marxist Group (UK)") left the ILP to form an open party. In 1938, this new group took part in several mergers to form the [Revolutionary Socialist League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Socialist_League_(UK,_1938) "Revolutionary Socialist League (UK, 1938)") (RSL). The RSL was a highly factionalised organisation.

### Speaking tour in the United States [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C._L._R._James&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Speaking tour in the United States")

At the urging of Trotsky and [James P. Cannon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._Cannon "James P. Cannon"), in October 1938, James was invited to tour the United States by the leadership of the [Socialist Workers' Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Workers%27_Party_(United_States) "Socialist Workers' Party (United States)") (SWP), then the US section of the [Fourth International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_International "Fourth International"), to facilitate its work among black workers.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> Following several meetings in [New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"), which garnered "enthusiastic praise for his oratorical ability and capacity for analysis of world events," James kicked off his national speaking tour on 6 January 1939 in [Philadelphia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia").<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> He gave lectures in cities including [New Haven](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut "New Haven, Connecticut"),<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> [Youngstown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown,_Ohio "Youngstown, Ohio"), [Rochester](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York "Rochester, New York"), and [Boston](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston "Boston"),<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> before finishing the tour with two lectures in [Los Angeles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles") and another in [Pasadena](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California "Pasadena, California") in March 1939.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_33-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-:0-33">[33]</a></sup> He spoke on topics such as "Twilight of the British Empire" and "The Negro and World Imperialism".<sup id="cite_ref-:0_33-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-:0-33">[33]</a></sup>

Constance Webb, who later became James' second wife, attended one of his 1939 lectures in Los Angeles and reflected on it in her memoir, writing: "I had already heard speeches by two great orators, [Winston Churchill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") and [Franklin Delano Roosevelt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt"). Now I was hearing a third. The three men were masters of the English language, a skill that gave them extraordinary power."<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

James's relationship with [Louise Cripps Samoiloff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Cripps_Samoiloff "Louise Cripps Samoiloff") had broken up after her second abortion, so that intimate tie no longer bound him to England.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

## Meeting Trotsky [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C._L._R._James&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Meeting Trotsky")

In April 1939, James visited Trotsky in [Coyoacán](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyoac%C3%A1n "Coyoacán"), [Mexico](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"). James stayed there about a month and also met [Diego Rivera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Rivera "Diego Rivera") and [Frida Kahlo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo "Frida Kahlo"), before returning to the United States in May 1939.<sup id="cite_ref-Jelly-Schapiro_36-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-Jelly-Schapiro-36">[36]</a></sup> A key topic that James and Trotsky discussed was the "Negro Question". Parts of their conversation were transcribed, with James sometimes referred to by his pen-name, J. R. Johnson.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> Whereas Trotsky saw the Trotskyist Party as providing leadership to the black community, in the general manner that the Bolsheviks provided guidance to ethnic minorities in Russia, James suggested that the self-organised struggle of African Americans would precipitate a much broader radical social movement.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

### U.S. and the Johnson–Forest Tendency [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C._L._R._James&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: U.S. and the Johnson–Forest Tendency")

James stayed in the United States until he was deported in 1953. By 1940, he had begun to doubt Trotsky's view of the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") as a [degenerated workers' state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerated_workers%27_state "Degenerated workers' state"). He left the SWP along with [Max Shachtman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Shachtman "Max Shachtman"), who formed the [Workers' Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Workers%27_Party_(United_States)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Workers' Party (United States) (page does not exist)") (WP). Within the WP, James formed the [Johnson–Forest Tendency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Forest_Tendency "Johnson–Forest Tendency") with [Raya Dunayevskaya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raya_Dunayevskaya "Raya Dunayevskaya") (his pseudonym was _Johnson_ and Dunayevskaya's was _Forest_) and Grace Lee (later [Grace Lee Boggs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Lee_Boggs "Grace Lee Boggs")) to spread their views within the new party.

As "J. R. Johnson", James wrote the column "The Negro Question" for _[Socialist Appeal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Appeal_(newspaper) "Socialist Appeal (newspaper)")_ (later renamed _[The Militant](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Militant "The Militant")_), and was also a columnist for _Labor Action_.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>

While within the WP, the views of the Johnson–Forest Tendency underwent considerable development. By the end of the [Second World War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War"), they had definitively rejected Trotsky's theory of Russia as a degenerated workers' state. Instead, they classified it as [state capitalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalist "State capitalist"), a political evolution shared by other Trotskyists of their generation, most notably [Tony Cliff](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Cliff "Tony Cliff"). Unlike Cliff, the Johnson–Forest Tendency was focusing increasingly on the liberation movements of oppressed minorities, a theoretical development already visible in James's thought in his 1939 discussions with Trotsky. Such liberation struggles came to take centre stage for the Johnson–Forest Tendency.

After the Second World War, the WP witnessed a downturn in revolutionary sentiment. The Tendency, on the other hand, was encouraged by the prospects for revolutionary change for oppressed peoples. After a few short months as an independent group, during which they published a great deal of material, in 1947, the Johnson–Forest Tendency joined the SWP, which it regarded as more proletarian than the WP.

James would still describe himself as a [Leninist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninist "Leninist") despite his rejection of [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin")'s conception of the vanguard role of the [revolutionary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary "Revolutionary") party. He argued for socialists to support the emerging [black nationalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_nationalist "Black nationalist") movements. By 1949, James rejected the idea of a [vanguard party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_party "Vanguard party"). This led the Johnson–Forest Tendency to leave the Trotskyist movement and rename itself the [Correspondence Publishing Committee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_Publishing_Committee "Correspondence Publishing Committee").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In 1955 after James had left for Britain, about half the membership of the Committee withdrew, under the leadership of [Raya Dunayevskaya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raya_Dunayevskaya "Raya Dunayevskaya"), to form a separate tendency of [Marxist humanism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_humanism "Marxist humanism") and found the organisation [News and Letters Committees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_and_Letters_Committees "News and Letters Committees"). Whether Dunayevskaya's faction had constituted a majority or a minority in the Correspondence Publishing Committee remains a matter of dispute. Historian [Kent Worcester](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Worcester "Kent Worcester") says that Dunayevskaya's supporters formed a majority, but [Martin Glaberman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Glaberman "Martin Glaberman") says in _[New Politics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Politics_(magazine) "New Politics (magazine)")_ that the faction loyal to James had a majority.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

The Committee split again in 1962, as Grace Lee Boggs and [James Boggs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Boggs_(activist) "James Boggs (activist)"), two key activists, left to pursue a more [Third Worldist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Worldist "Third Worldist") approach. The remaining Johnsonites, including leading member Martin Glaberman, reconstituted themselves as [Facing Reality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facing_Reality "Facing Reality"). James advised the group from Great Britain until it dissolved in 1970, against his urging.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>

James's writings were also influential in the development of [Autonomist Marxism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomist_Marxism "Autonomist Marxism") as a current within Marxist thought. He himself saw his life's work as developing the theory and practice of Leninism.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Return to Britain [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C._L._R._James&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Return to Britain")

In 1953, James was forced to leave the US under threat of deportation for having overstayed his visa. In his attempt to remain in America, he wrote a study of [Herman Melville](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville "Herman Melville"), _Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and the World We Live In_, and had copies of the privately published work sent to every member of the Senate. He wrote the book while being detained at the immigration station on [Ellis Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Island "Ellis Island"). In an impassioned letter to his old friend George Padmore, James said that in _Mariners_ he was using _[Moby-Dick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick "Moby-Dick")_ as a parable for the [anti-communism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-communism "Anti-communism") sweeping the United States, a consequence, he thought, of Americans' uncritical faith in capitalism.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

Returning to Britain, James appeared to Padmore and his partner [Dorothy Pizer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Pizer "Dorothy Pizer") to be a man adrift. After James started reporting on cricket for the _[Manchester Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")_, Padmore wrote to American novelist [Richard Wright](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_(author) "Richard Wright (author)"): "That will take him out of his [ivory tower](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_tower "Ivory tower") and making his paper revolution...."<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> [Grace Lee Boggs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Lee_Boggs "Grace Lee Boggs"), a colleague from the Detroit group, came to London in 1954 to work with James, but she too, saw him "at loose ends, trying to find his way after fifteen years out of the country."<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>

In 1957, James travelled to [Ghana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana "Ghana") for the celebration of its independence from British rule in March that year. He had met [Ghana's new head of state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ghana "President of Ghana"), [Kwame Nkrumah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Nkrumah "Kwame Nkrumah"), in the United States when Nkrumah was studying there and sent him on to work with George Padmore in London after the Second World War; Padmore was by this point a close Nkrumah advisor and had written _The Gold Coast Revolution_ (1953). In correspondence sent from Ghana in 1957, James told American friends that Nkrumah thought he too ought to write a book on the [Convention People's Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_People%27s_Party "Convention People's Party"), which under Nkrumah's leadership had brought the country to independence. The book shows how the party's strategies could be used to build a new African future. James invited Grace Lee Boggs, his colleague from Detroit, to join in the work, though in the end, James wrote _Nkrumah and the Ghana Revolution_ on his own. The book was not published until 1977, years after Nkrumah's overthrow, exile and subsequent death.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>

## Trinidad and afterwards [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C._L._R._James&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Trinidad and afterwards")

In 1958 James went back to Trinidad, where he edited _The Nation_ newspaper for the pro-independence [People's National Movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_National_Movement "People's National Movement") (PNM) party. He also became active again in the Pan-African movement. He believed that the [Ghana revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Ghana#Independence "History of Ghana") greatly encouraged the [anticolonialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization "Decolonization") revolutionary struggle.

James also advocated the [West Indies Federation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_Federation "West Indies Federation").<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> It was over this issue that he fell out with the PNM leadership.

James married his first wife, Juanita Young, in Trinidad in 1929, but his move three years later to Britain led to their estrangement. He met his second wife, Constance Webb (1918–2005), an American model, actress and author, after he moved to the US in 1938; she wrote of having first heard him speak in the spring of 1939 at a meeting in California.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> James and Webb married in 1946 and their son, C.

## Writings on cricket [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=C._L._R._James&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Writings on cricket")

He is widely known as a writer on cricket, especially for his autobiographical 1963 book, _[Beyond a Boundary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_a_Boundary "Beyond a Boundary")_, which he himself described as "neither cricket reminiscences nor autobiography".<sup id="cite_ref-James,_1963_6-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-James,_1963-6">[6]</a></sup> It is considered a seminal work on the game, and is often named as the best single book on cricket (or even the best book on any sport) ever written.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_7-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-autogenerated1-7">[7]</a></sup> [John Arlott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Arlott "John Arlott") called it "so outstanding as to compel any reviewer to check his adjectives several times before he describes it and, since he is likely to be dealing in superlatives, to measure them carefully to avoid over-praise – which this book does not need ... in the opinion of the reviewer, it is the finest book written about the game of cricket."<sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup> A conference to mark the 50th anniversary of its first publication was held 10–11 May 2013.<sup id="cite_ref-Glasgow_conference_90-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-Glasgow_conference-90">[90]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup>

The book's key question, frequently quoted by modern journalists and essayists, is inspired by a line in [Rudyard Kipling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling "Rudyard Kipling")'s poem "English Flag" – "What do they know of England who only England know?" James asks in the Preface: "What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?" Acknowledging that "To answer involves ideas as well as facts", James uses this challenge as the basis for describing cricket in an historical and social context, the strong influence cricket had on his life, and how it meshed with his role in politics and his understanding of issues of class and race.

While editor of _The Nation_, he led the successful campaign in 1960 to have [Frank Worrell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Worrell "Frank Worrell") appointed the first black captain of the [West Indies cricket team](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team "West Indies cricket team"). James believed that the relationship between players and the public was a prominent reason behind the West Indies' achieving so much with so little.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._L._R._James#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup>
