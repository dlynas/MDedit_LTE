"Only a century ago, LA boasts to the largest rail transit network in America.
Long before freeways, long before bumper-to-bumper traffic, the Pacific Electric Railway moved LA.
For three generations, it's red cars defined the look and sound of LA streets.
Whistles blowing, wheels clattering, more than a thousand miles of track.
The red cars also drove LA's economy.
This was how working class angelinos commuted to their jobs every day.
And then, on April 9, 1961, the red cars suddenly fell silent.
At 3.45 in the morning, the final red car rumbled down line 36 from downtown LA and into oblivion.
So where did all those red cars go?
Most were sold for scrap.
Some went to museums.
Others became long narrow houses.
A few turned up in Argentina.
And a small number took the plunge.
Dropped into the waters offered down to beach to create an artificial reef."
