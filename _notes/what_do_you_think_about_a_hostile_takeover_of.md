## What do you think about a hostile take-over of welfare?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/1bogn9v/what_do_you_think_about_a_hostile_takeover_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/1bogn9v/what_do_you_think_about_a_hostile_takeover_of/)

> Suppose I go to YCombinator and propose a non-profit "sovereign wealth fund". This fund would go ask the wealthiest individuals for tax-deductible donations. These donations would then be invested in for-profit avenues like S&P 500 index etc. The profits would then have a portion re-invested in the fund and a portion that replaces a certain number of people's welfare. 
> 
> I could start with something like Social Security. Suppose I approach a SS recipient who receives $2k/mo from the gov't and offer them $2500/mo if they sign over their SS check so that it can be re-invested back into the fund. It may take some time for the fund to grow and replace all of SS but it would be growing additionally at the rate at which the gov't is paying into it indirectly. 
> 
> Once the whole of the people on SS are receiving money from the sovereign wealth fund, Americans could petition legislatures to stop collecting that tax in exchange for a guarantee to receive the same sovereign wealth fund checks when they retire. It would be quite popular because that puts more money in their pocket immediately through lower taxes.
> 
> Eventually you could go on and on and take over all welfare programs and cut the gov't out of the loop. Hence the term hostile take-over. But why stop there? Keep it growing and start offering checks to no/low income people. At some point have an artificial general intelligence calculate everything from what to invest in to who needs checks and how much. If it creates enough efficiencies to have an abundance just start paying everyone. At that point it becomes a sustainable UBI.
> 
> I like this idea because rich people don't trust gov't but they have tons of capital sitting dormant, making them look really bad to the 90% who have very little capital. It's like an insurance policy for them if you think about it. Especially as AI is poised to replace a lot of jobs and create high unemployment leading to social unrest and bankrupting unemployment insurance. Also throw in the future insolvency of social security and population decline.
> 
> A common criticism is that people won't want to work if you give them money and that's true for some people but as we see with retirees they work anyway. Also the fund would have a limit of how much it can pay out based on sheer economics so people who want more would be incentivized to work. Additionally, people would want the fund to do well so they can get paid more, which means they want the economy to do well. 
> 
> Another common criticism is that it's redistribution of wealth but this is entirely voluntary so nobody is being forced to donate or participate. They are incentivized by social stability, lower taxes, and no gov't conditions on their welfare. 
> 
> This could additionally open up some opportunities like:  
> 1. Harnessing private capital could unlock new funding streams beyond limited public resources  
> 2. Providing choice/optionality versus mandatory government welfare programs  
> 3. Introducing market incentives and accountability into social support systems  
> 4. Potential efficiency gains from technology/AI optimization of allocation
> 
>   
> It would have the following challenges like:  
> 1. Reaching critical mass of donations to fully replace government programs  
> 2. Ensuring consistent, equitable coverage for all in need, not just volunteers  
> 3. Regulatory hurdles and opposition to privatizing core public welfare functions  
> 4. Long-term sustainability concerns if market returns underperform projections  
> 5. Governance and oversight to prevent misuse or unintended distortions  
> Your thoughts? Should I do it?

	Every year, the US spends about 1.4 trillion on social security, 1.5 trillion on healthcare, 500 billion on economic security programs and another 500 billion on benefits for veterans and federal employees. you're not replicating that with private dollars.

		Not to mention that the policies regarding tax benefits for charitable contributions by the wealthy already exist, and they generate private programs that are minuscule in comparison to these proposals, targeted toward wealthy people's interests and beliefs (obviously), and in general nothing like a substitute for welfare programs.

			Social security benefits are not taxable income. You aren’t convincing retirees to sign on for decreased income taxes. 
			
			There are misaligned or non-existent incentives for almost every involved party you’re talking about. Social security taxes do not increase past $186k yearly salary. You pay the same at $1m as you do at $200k yearly salary.

				Some states tax them. But yeah, not federally.

				Well one could factor in the taxes and just pay them for the retiree so it's essentially tax free income for them. 
				
				So a few millionaires won't get a progressive tax cut because they make over $186k? What's the big deal? They still get a tax cut on that $186k.

					Woof, says the teenager who is clearly in the dark about how markets, taxes,and government welfare work…

			Bro the problem is t the investing mechanism, it’s the dollar value that you wouldn’t be able to raise. 
			
			Also, you posited advertising monthly returns of 20% (give me $2k, I’ll give you $2.5k back) which annualize to ~800% annually. If you could actually do that, you’d be working for RenTech Medallion, not LARPing as some 21st century Robin Hood. 
			
			And that’s assuming that this dog and pony show doesn’t turn into a Ponzi Scheme (which is sorta how you initially described this….)
