I have something unformed to say, but basically it comes down to hiding or refusing to face reality being, at their very core, evil. Israel is determined to kill-expel every single man, woman and child in Gaza. 99% of their actions and words point clearly that way, since Oct. 1/



Pretending otherwise, paying attention to the 1% words, deflection, Holocaust-washing and symbolic actions designed to draw attention away from a thorough and deliberate genocide, is evil. Because it gives protection to the genocide and the genocidaires. 2/

Yet this pretence is what so many of our politicians, commentators and journalists see as their full-time job, since the start. And it is pure evil. There is no way to look at the balance of evidence, the words and actions that matter in terms of actions on the ground ... 3/

and not come to the evidence-based conclusion that this is a thorough, cruel and deliberate genocide, ongoing at blitz speed. Anyone who deflects from that reality deflects also from the absolute moral necessity to stop it. 4/

At some level, I always knew some people can become genocidal. This is not particularly rare in our history. What I didn't realise was how many more people would twist themselves into knots to facilitate the actions of the genocidaires. Like those knots were their real shape. 5/

And no action of facilitation has been more effective than deflecting the reality. From pretty much all Western media refusing to show the reality of the genocide, when it is being livestreamed, to politicians from Germany to the US using the Shoah, the murder of my family ... 6/

members, to excuse a new genocide. This deflection of reality is monstrous to be seeing still triumphing, after the ICJ case and evidence, after 6 months of genocide. Deflection of reality is THE monster here, because facing reality forces us to act. End/

A recent Pew poll found that 48% of Americans did not know whether the death count in the war on Gaza was higher for Israelis or Palestinians. The death toll currently stands at 1,200 in Israel and 32,000 Palestinians pulse.ly/rkptpm7ibv

Thank you for these posts Julia. Do you have it as a Substack ? I think it’s worst sharing to a wider audience.

Hi Sunny, not sure substack is a wider audience. Also for that particular site, their founders are anti-trans, so I will never support them.

The most evil are those who allow it to happen, the fence sitters, the cheerleaders, the people complaining about protests, ripping down pro-palestine stickers, flocking to Palestinian acounts to troll every post, the banality of it all...makes you lose faith in humanity.

The West is waking up to the acute danger of Islamic terrorism. Many Arab states also condemn Islamic terrorism. You should too. 

Pointing to a significant pair of those words: "civilian collapse" ->

When the history of the Israeli onslaught on Gaza is written, I suspect this phrase that hasn't got a lot of attention yet might be central: "civilian collapse."

Alon Mizrahi I without equality there's no freedom

As an Israeli in this dark disgusting inhuman time, there are many things I see and hear and can tell you about and are worthy of research and serious consideration, but there is one part of it that is so uncanny, so disheartening, so extraordinary, that I can hardly describe it,
