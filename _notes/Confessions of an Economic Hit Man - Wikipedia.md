_**Confessions of an Economic Hit Man**_ is a [semi-autobiographical book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-autobiographical "Semi-autobiographical") written by American economist and essayist [John Perkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perkins_(author) "John Perkins (author)"), first published in 2004.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

The book provides Perkins' account of his career with [engineering consulting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_consulting "Engineering consulting") firm [Chas. T. Main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chas._T._Main "Chas. T. Main") in Boston. Perkins claims that the [NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency "National Security Agency") arranged for him to be hired by the firm, and that he was subsequently seduced and trained as an "economic hitman" by a mysterious businesswoman named Claudine. Perkins writes that his primary role at Chas T. Main was to convince leaders of [underdeveloped countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country "Developing country") to accept substantial development loans for large construction and engineering projects, thus trapping them in a system of American influence and control.

The book was a commercial success, but critics expressed doubts about the accuracy and validity of claims Perkins made in the book. Perkins was referred to as a conspiracy theorist by one reviewer, while a number of former colleagues at Chas T. Main disputed or disagreed with some of his allegations. Several reviewers discussed a lack of documentation or verification for Perkins' claims.

## Content\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Content")\]

The book provides Perkins' account of his career with [engineering consulting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_consulting "Engineering consulting") firm [Chas. T. Main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chas._T._Main "Chas. T. Main") in Boston. Perkins claims the involvement of the [National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency "National Security Agency") (NSA), with whom he had interviewed for a job prior to joining Main. According to the author, this interview effectively constituted an independent screening that led to his subsequent hiring as an 'economic hit man' by Einar Greve,<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> vice president of the firm (and alleged NSA liaison). Perkins claims that he was seduced and trained as an "economic hitman" by a mysterious businesswoman named Claudine, who used his [NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency "National Security Agency") personality profile to manipulate and control him.<sup id="cite_ref-:02_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-:02-5">[5]</a></sup>

According to Perkins, his job at the firm was to convince leaders of [underdeveloped countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country "Developing country") to accept substantial development loans for large construction and engineering projects. Ensuring that these projects were contracted to U.S. companies, such loans provided political influence for the US and access to [natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource "Natural resource") for American companies,<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 15, 239">: 15, 239 </span></sup>  thus primarily helping local elites and wealthy families, rather than the poor.

The book heavily criticizes [U.S. foreign policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States "Foreign policy of the United States") and the notion that "all economic growth benefits humankind, and that the greater the growth, the more widespread the benefits."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: xii">: xii </span></sup>  Perkins suggests that, in many cases, only a small portion of the population benefits at the expense of the rest, pointing to, as an example, an increase in [income inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality "Economic inequality"), whereby large U.S. corporations exploit cheap labor, and [oil companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oil_exploration_and_production_companies "List of oil exploration and production companies") destroy local environments.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: xii">: xii </span></sup> 

Perkins describes what he calls a system of [corporatocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatocracy "Corporatocracy") and greed as the driving forces behind establishing the United States as a global empire, in which he took a role as an "economic hit man" to expand its influence. In this capacity, Perkins recounts his meetings with some prominent individuals, including [Graham Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene "Graham Greene") and [Omar Torrijos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Torrijos "Omar Torrijos"). Perkins describes the role of an economic hit man as follows:

> Economic hit men (EHMs) are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. They funnel money from the World Bank, the [U.S. Agency for International Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Agency_for_International_Development "U.S. Agency for International Development") (USAID), and other foreign "aid" organizations into the coffers of huge corporations and the pockets of a few wealthy families who control the planet's natural resources. Their tools included fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion, sex, and murder. They play a game as old as empire, but one that has taken on new and terrifying dimensions during this time of globalization.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

## Reception and criticism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Reception and criticism")\]

Although the accuracy of the content has been questioned, the book did well in terms of sales, placing on the [best-seller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bestseller "Bestseller") lists of both the [_New York Times_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list "The New York Times Best Seller list") and [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company) "Amazon (company)").<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

Columnist [Sebastian Mallaby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Mallaby "Sebastian Mallaby") of _[The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")_ reacted sharply to Perkins' book: "This man is a frothing conspiracy theorist, a vainglorious peddler of nonsense, and yet his book, _Confessions of an Economic Hit Man_, is a runaway bestseller."<sup id="cite_ref-mallaby_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-mallaby-8">[8]</a></sup> Mallaby holds that Perkins' conception of international finance is "largely a dream" and that his "basic contentions are flat wrong."<sup id="cite_ref-mallaby_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-mallaby-8">[8]</a></sup> For instance, he points out that [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia") reduced its [infant mortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality "Infant mortality") and [illiteracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illiteracy "Illiteracy") rates by two-thirds after economists persuaded its leaders to borrow money in 1970. He also disputes Perkins' claim that 51 of the top 100 world economies belong to companies.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

Other sources, including articles in _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_ and _[Boston Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Magazine "Boston Magazine")_, as well as a press release issued by the [U.S Department of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State") (DOS), have referred to a lack of documentary or [testimonial evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence "Anecdotal evidence") to corroborate Perkins's claim that the NSA was involved in his hiring to [Chas T. Main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chas._T._Main "Chas. T. Main"). In addition, the author of the DOS release states that the NSA "is a [cryptological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography") (codemaking and [codebreaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis "Cryptanalysis")) organization, not an economic organization" and that its missions do not involve "anything remotely resembling placing economists at private companies in order to increase the debt of foreign countries."<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

[Economic historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history "Economic history") [Niall Ferguson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niall_Ferguson "Niall Ferguson") addresses some of Perkins's claims in the 2008 book _[The Ascent of Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ascent_of_Money "The Ascent of Money")_ (2008). Perkins contended that the leaders of [Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador "Ecuador") (President [Jaime Roldós Aguilera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Rold%C3%B3s_Aguilera "Jaime Roldós Aguilera")) and [Panama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama "Panama") (General [Omar Torrijos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Torrijos "Omar Torrijos")) were killed by U.S. agents for opposing the interests of the owners of their countries' foreign debt. Both men died in airplane crashes in 1981. According to Ferguson, Perkins's allegations "seems a little odd."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-:1-11">[11]</a></sup> Ferguson notes how in the 1970s, the amount of money that the US had lent to Ecuador and Panama accounted for less than 0.4% of the total U.S. grants and loans, while in 1990, exports from the US to those countries accounted for approximately 0.4% of total U.S. exports (approx. [US$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar")8 billion). Ferguson contends those "do not seem like figures worth killing for."<sup id="cite_ref-:1_11-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-:1-11">[11]</a></sup>

Chas. T. Main's former vice president Einar Greve, who first offered Perkins a job at the firm,<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 10">: 10 </span></sup>  agreed that foreign debt represented a poor economic strategy for developing nations:<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

> Basically his story is true.… What John's book says is, there was a conspiracy to put all these countries on the hook, and that happened. Whether or not it was some sinister plot or not is up to interpretation, but many of these countries are still over the barrel and have never been able to repay the loans.

However, Greve denied many aspects of Perkins' claims, such as the NSA having any links to Main, or that Perkins was seduced by Claudine Martin, saying that he believes that Perkins has convinced himself that his story is accurate.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-:2-13">[13]</a></sup> _Boston_ _Magazine_ noted that Perkins can provide little documentation to support his claims of international intrigue, describing a largely unconvincing "flimsy package of materials."<sup id="cite_ref-:2_13-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-:2-13">[13]</a></sup> A number of Perkins' former colleagues disagreed with his perspective on the company and contradicted specific claims he made; Frank Fullerton, one of his supervisors, stated that Perkins left Chas T. Main because he "thought he was worth more than he was."<sup id="cite_ref-:2_13-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man#cite_note-:2-13">[13]</a></sup>

## Other works\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Other works")\]
