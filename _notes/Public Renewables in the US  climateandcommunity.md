JOBS: A federal public renewables strategy can help create unionized, high-paying, and high road jobs. As a federally deployed program, it can mandate workers directly employed or contracted through it to receive prevailing wages under the Davis–Bacon Act. The Program can also attach important strings to disbursement or procurement, such as Project Labor Agreements or apprenticeships that guarantee stability and continuity for the workforce. We also propose important commitments to develop a multiracial workforce through robust local-hire commitments and prioritizing workers from environmental justice communities.

JUSTICE: Within the United States, the disproportionate burdens of an extractive energy system have been borne by BIPOC and working-class communities—often described collectively as “environmental justice communities.” This program offers an opportunity to move beyond a decarbonization or profit motive framework, and instead conceptualize the development of renewable energy as a public good. The program could be crucial to achieving President Biden’s Justice40 commitments, with the power to directly invest 40 percent of all investments, as well as any profits generated beyond system reinvestment, in environmental justice communities. The IRA largely fell flat in delivering Justice 40, with only about 16 percent of funds earmarked for disadvantaged communities. We also propose that by combining a public approach with community engagement and partnership at different scales, the program can better serve to build community wealth and engender local buy-in.

DEMOCRACY: We see public ownership as a tool to produce higher accountability to community members and shift control over the energy transition. The ultimate owner and decision maker of the energy source is the public instead of a Wall Street bank or high-paid executives in corporate boardrooms. Importantly, top-down federal government processes have been known to be co-opted, and the program takes explicit care to propose robust governance that brings stakeholders at multiple scales—including workers, communities, and environmental advocates—to the table. 

Imagine solar spanning the Sunbelt in the Southwest, wind farms whirring across the plains of Iowa, and expansive rooftop solar on Puerto Rican households—publicly owned and deployed at a far faster pace than the private sector has provided. This is the future that the Federal Public Power Program could help to bring to fruition.
