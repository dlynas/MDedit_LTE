People pretending he’s not been consistently the greater evil for decades piss me off.

Every time we were wishing for a fair individual taking over the presidency in USA ,the result turns out to be that he’s worse than his predecessor, The lesson is to rely only on your own aspirations and determination, rather than placing hope in someone else

Biden gave us Thomas. Wouldn't let corroborating witnesses testify for Anita Hill

seemless transition really

That mf was also the co writer of the patriot act which is the red line everyone should have if they stand on the left

He was so proud he even went to the bill signing ceremony

He is a total and utter disgrace. If he does not step aside, he will lose. He will go down as the man that caused genocide and American fascism
