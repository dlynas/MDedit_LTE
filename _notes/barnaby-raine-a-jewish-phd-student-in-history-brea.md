"The World Health Organization called that a death sentence for patients in those hospitals
who couldn't be moved and so were being left to die.
One of the hospitals that Israel ordered evacuated was the hospital that has now been bombed.
So Israel said it was going to bomb hospitals, then a hospital got bombed.
Israel's dropped more bombs on Gaza this week than America dropped on Afghanistan
in the first year of their occupation of Afghanistan in 2001.
Fadi Diabbe priest in Ramallah said we hold the occupying power responsible if it's good enough for a priest.
It's good enough for me and we know that Israel continues to block electricity from baby incubators
and dialysis patients. We know that Israel continues to block water from surgeons and elderly people.
I mean people in Gaza don't have access to clean water, food from survivors and we know that Israel bombs
roads after it tells people to flee along those roads. We also know that on October the 14th, Israel
targeted ambulances and we know that before this bombing Israel had already killed 28 medical staff
in Gaza. We know too as you said that part of the Israeli playbook is to lie about the attacks
the murders. It doesn't please me to say this. In 1996 Israel's shelter UN compound in Lebanon
blamed it on others. It wasn't true. In 2006 Israel murdered an entire family on a beach in Gaza.
The idea had a quick investigation that said the idea wasn't responsible. It wasn't true.
In 2014 Mark Ragev we've seen him again on our TV screens recently.
Claim that unrestites that UN refugee and works agency sites were used to launch missiles.
The UN investigated it wasn't true. Last year Israeli forces murdered Palestinian journalist
Rehnebo Aqleh blamed Palestinians. It wasn't true. Journalists can't really investigate what's
going on in Gaza because even the Washington Post which is not I tell you a friend of the Palestinian
people says it is quote becoming impossible to report from Gaza under the conditions of siege and
bombardment that Israel has established. So part of what concerns me here looking at the Western
media because this whole brutal siege and bombardment campaign by Israel has been an object lesson
in the racism that structures everything in our media ecosystem. It has been quite well I
want to say extraordinary but I haven't even been that surprised to watch Western journalist
rush to report an old blood libel to rush to report that 40 babies were beheaded by blood thirsty
savage Palestinians even though it later turned out there wasn't much evidence for it completely
ignored by the way Hamas's accounts of what happened in their attack and just report the Israeli
accounts. But then when Israel says despite this record of lying when Israel says that they're not
sure who bombed this hospital or blames Palestinians for killing their own children. Journalists
rush to say of course you must be measured and take them seriously including I should say
some left wing journalists and that's concerning to people because it seems to be a kind of double
standard that is a reeks of racism. Razigal the Israeli genocide expert is calling what happens in
Gaza a textbook case of genocide now 800 legal scholars have written that they are quote compelled
to sound the alarm about the possibility of genocide in Gaza it is clear that Israel is targeting
civilians they've targeted residential buildings they've targeted journalists they've targeted
medics and medical facilities this isn't the first case. The question we I think should ask is why
they're doing this why this brutal blanket campaign cutting off water if you didn't want to target
civilians you wouldn't cut off water and you wouldn't cut off fuel why are they doing it they don't
need to they have an iron dome missile defense system that means that most missiles the Palestinians
fire into Israel don't reach targets they couldn't negotiate the release of hostages there are
6,000 Palestinian prisoners languishing in Israeli jails without receiving fair trials serious
allegations of torture which we rarely hear about on the news that we hear much about Israeli hostages
in Gaza they couldn't negotiate for the release of their hostages instead their bombing Gaza and
killing by some reports some of their own hostages this won't of course destroy Hamas when you
carpet bomb people who are living under a colonial siege and constant bombardment the only
effect it can have is to strengthen people's fury anger and resolve to resist the colonizing
power so of course it won't break resistance even if they were to destroy the Hamas infrastructure
something else would emerge in its place so why why are they doing this it's not by the way
because Hamas caused the problem because in the west bank where there is no Hamas regime
settlers have attacked funerals in the last week and launched attacks on Palestinian villages
killing parents and children and the idea for shot and killed 62 Palestinians in the last week
when I last checked in the west bank which is a place that does not have a Hamas government and
before this later massacre 2023 was already the deadliest year on record for children in the
west bank with one child murdered every week by Israeli forces so it isn't because there's a
resistance on clay for Israel's violent it seems to have this lashing out violent impulse regardless
the reason is that it's the logic of the colonizer the reason is that Israelis know deep down and
I'm speaking here of some of my own family members so it pains me to say it but they know deep down
that they are living in other people's stolen homes they know that they are living in a state that
was premised on an act of ethnic cleansing when 700,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes
that's why Gaza is so densely populated because most of the Palestinians living in Gaza aren't from
Gaza their refugees penned in there because they were chased out of other parts of Israel and that's
why the important thing to do now is not simply to call for peace not simply to call for the end
of this massacre though that is crucial but to understand that we want a world in which people
don't live penned into an open air prison because they're chased from their homes to call not
simply for peace but for freedom and to say when we see people partying at a rave and then being
killed by Hamas operatives that they were partying five miles away from an open air prison if you move
five miles from where those people were partying in Israel to Gaza life expectancy drops 10 years we
don't just want peace and the return of a world in which that is the case we desperately want
desperately want people all over the world in our millions for freedom for everyone to be able to
live a life of freedom and dignity and that's why we want victory for the Palestinian people
yeah I mean I agree with most of that I suppose on this question of verification I mean you've
you've sort of then given given a political position which I'm very sympathetic towards
when it comes to do you just say okay well this was an Israeli air strike I will take you about I
mean in in what you just said you were saying there are many journalists who are willing to put
on their front pages that 40 babies were beheaded with zero evidence and then you know we we did a
video sort of critiquing that saying there's no verification for this I actually I mean we haven't
really covered any of this stuff which is being put out by people who have gone on record and sort
of said oh we saw this and that brutality in the cabots is because I think if it's just based on
one or two sort of eyewitnesses who also probably have some political prejudices themselves
that's not good enough for for us to report it so then there is a similar situation here no whereby
if there are doubts then you should say it appears to be this or it appears to be that
and to be honest that shouldn't have that much impact on the politics of all of this because we know
that Israel is definitely doing enough bad stuff to not have to necessarily rule out the possibility
that this could have been something else I mean I think we will see you know more forensic evidence
from sort of people over the next days and weeks because to me I think both options are possible
right I don't think my solidarity with Palestinian people is dependent on on which one of these is
is true but both to me do seem possible and I do think that sort of as journalists not just as
political activists you do have to sort of take account of the fact that verification does matter
obviously you need to you know uphold both sides to to that standard I mean what do you make of that
I think you should think about the context of the last week and a half in which we have witnessed
the insidious dehumanization of the Palestinian people they buried 40 babies they blew up their
own hospital and they have been compared including by some commentators on the British left to
Nazis and pogromists um who are you talking about here on that well if you want names
Paul Mason says that compares Palestinians breaking out of a cage and and entering Israel as part
of a guerrilla war when they've been left with no negotiations process no precise weapons guided
missile technology he compares them to carrying out pogroms which is an insult both to Palestinians
in a cage and to my ancestors who were genuine victims of pogroms and weren't colonial settlers
who'd stolen people's land I saw Owen Jones saying if we really want to name names I saw Owen
Jones saying talking about the Hamas attackers the most Jews dying since the holocaust again deeply
deeply insulting both to Palestinians and to those who were murdered in the holocaust so that
kind of dehumanization functions to legitimate the massacre of people because it makes these people
Palestinians um something disgusting and um and and bigoted and savage and violent and there's
just a very long history of this that you should be aware of there's a very long history of when
the colonized strike back and say very clearly they're striking back for freedom and dignity they are
discussed instead as blood thirsty savages who have a lust for chaos and destruction and that's
why they're fighting and that kind of language functions to legitimate the colonial violence that
is then needed out to them so when a hospital is blown up and the Israeli state says it was the
Palestinians they killed their own children you should be aware that it's not simply unbiased
journalistic integrity to report that claim there's a there's a deep very very violent ideological
pressure at work in that claim and it troubles me it troubles me because I am the descendants of
people who for 2000 years white Christian Europe excluded and said eventually was subhuman Jews um
and so I see this language when Israelis talk about human animals when Israelis talk about children
of darkness as Netanyahu did when Israelis talk about the law of the jungle this is the language
that was developed to exclude and murder and persecute my people Jews it was then used across
Africa and Asia and South America to exclude and murder and brutalize people is well as just the
latest iteration of violent colonial western power it's no surprise that American Britain supported
they developed that kind of racist language and they're still drowning thousands of people
every year in the Mediterranean so that's the kind of racist world order we live in and that's
the kind of racist world order that allows Israeli politicians to be blasé about the claim that
Palestinians killed their own children I just feel like you're conflating quite a lot of things there
so you're conflating sort of the Palestinian government called sort of not that the Israeli government
calling Palestinians children and I mean I wouldn't use this sort of Holocaust comparison but
suppose what people were talking about there and what I assume I was talking about there is why
people are upset about this why people would be upset by a lot of civilians getting killed in Israel
you know even though you say well there were some of the factors to the fact that people
can party next to the Gaza wall but still I think people should you know put forward some sympathy
to people who are just going to a party and the parents of those people who are just going to a
party and I suppose I'm not sure if you're almost disagreeing with that well I don't think that
anyone dying is ever a good thing I think that anyone dying is a tragedy I have never been
deliberately starved by a colonial power that chased me from my land so I try not to judge the
actions of people who have been in that position I live in Britain where our government sends weapons
to Israel what we can do is not spend our time condemning and attacking the actions of the people
killed with the bombs that our tax is fund but instead try to ensure that our tax is no longer fund
those bombs we all celebrate Nelson Mandela the majority of people killed by the ANC in their
armed struggle campaign were civilians the ANC felt that that armed struggle campaign was
necessary to end a system of racist deshumanization in South Africa Mandela was called a terrorist for
it and attacked for it there's a long history of this kind of thing I'm concerned with stopping our
money going to murdering Palestinian men women and children and I think the time spent attacking
Palestinians for the military strategies that they choose um um it is frankly offensive and insulting
given that none of us have ever lived for decades under a occupation and blockade I mean so as far
as I understand though the ANC example was quite different I think they they didn't kill that many
so I think it was sort of in the in the low hundreds over the whole campaign then they ended up
sort of renouncing it and I suppose part of the anti apartheid struggle was in a way about sort
of building links to I mean obviously it was outside pressure it was rebellion it was a a a
huge boycott and sanctions from the outside which is why I'm in favor of BDS but I don't think they
sort of necessarily went to think such as all music festivals and just killed lots of people like to
me there's not only moral problems with that it seems a bit strategically odd I suppose strategically
that makes sense if you're going for this sort of Algeria model which is you're trying to scare people
so much that they sort of leave your land and you can take it back um I mean potentially that's what
people are going for I'm just not sure if that's particularly realistic in in this situation because
I think you know the people of Israel are somewhat different to the French Algerians who are in in
Algeria I really really really don't want people to be killed at music festivals I want a world in
which frankly I really really like music festivals I want a world in which we can all dance at music
festivals and be free um I don't want a world in which people dance at music festivals five miles
away from an open air prison camp in which more than half the population is food insecure in which
in this territory Gaza which is what was partly dependent on fishing 85% of its fishing waters are
controlled by Israel and every single aspect of the movement of people in the territory is so
controlled by Israel that they can cut off food and water and fuel at will I don't think that's a
normal situation that should be allowed to continue I want there to be strikes and non-violent
resistance and no one to be harmed in the march to freedom of course I want that everyone wants that
but in a situation in which for decades the Israeli state has occupied and oppressed and besieged
and bombarded Palestinians for people in the west who have not been in that position to spend their
time condemning the things that Palestinians do when our governments fund the Israeli war machine
I just think it's the wrong choice of our attention I think that's wrong and I think that to compare
Palestinians and you said you wouldn't do this but to compare Palestinians to anti-Semitic
persecutors of Jews who rounded us up just for living in Europe and put us eventually in gas
chambers to compare to to tar Europe's shame at its failure to prevent centuries of anti-Semitism
and to accuse Palestinians who did not carry out the Holocaust Europeans did to accuse Palestinians
of that because they just want to live in peace and freedom I think it's just frankly sickening
it genuinely genuinely sickening me it's an insult to generations of my family members who were
butchered by the same kind of brutality and exclusion that said some people are human animals
but now we see carried out by the state of Israel yes those people those people in the state of
Israel are Jews but they've just taken on they've taken on the European Gentiles way of thinking
about the world they've taken on all the violence that they call western civilization which says
some people have rights and other people don't and so just as we have to break the back of
zarrism and just we have to break the back of every anti-Semitic regime and just we have to
break the back of European colonialism everywhere we have to break the back of the Zionist state so
that everyone can be free everyone can live in peace and freedom but you know like Palestinians what
I don't know what Palestinians are supposed to do you know Israel was about to normalize relations
with Saudi Arabia the Israel has completely divided the Palestinian"
