## NEW PATREON EP: "Palestine Pt. 7: Direct Action w/ Max Geller of @pal_action." Direct action is a strategy that has been utilized for a very, very long time by the left, as a way to achieve their goals— from all tendencies: anarchists, socialists, to communists. Direct action can take a wide variety of forms, from the forest protectors doing tree sit-ins in Atlanta’s Weelaunee forest as part of the Stop Cop City movement, to residents of the Bay Area congregating early in the morning at the port of Oakland to stop a boat carrying weapons for Israel from leaving the dock. 

From climate change to police brutality to Indigenous resistance against pipeline companies, direct action has been used over and over to stand up to individuals, institutions, and state actors of all sorts. In this Patreon episode, we’re going to take a deep dive into direct action, focusing on how this strategy has been deployed here in the U.S. and in the U.K. in the context of Israel’s ongoing ethnic cleansing campaign against the Palestinian people.

Max Geller (@maximumwage) is a public-facing member of Palestine Action in the UK who has been working with Palestine Action for about three and a half years, and has been doing pro-Palestine, anti-zionist work for many years with organizations such as Jewish Voice for Peace, the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, the National Students for Justice in Palestine Steering Committee, and with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, or BDS, movement.

In this conversation we explore the work that Palestine Action is doing both in the U.K. and in the United States (@pal_actionus), we talk about direct action as a strategy and compare it to some other forms of action, we talk about some of the repression that activists have been facing—particularly here in the U.S. where anti-protest laws are beginning to become more and more common, we talk about Elbit Systems—which Palestine Action has targeted due to their prominent role in supplying weapons to Israel, and we explore Israel’s role as a major arms exporter to the rest of the world.

	"There are only five companies in the UK that have the license to ship and truck weapons from the factories to the boats or to the planes that they traveled to their destination from.
	They're logistics companies and you have to have special military clearance in order to carry this type of cargo and
	we have been for the last three months
	pressuring
	Elbids trucking company to drop them and
	Three weeks ago we succeeded they emailed us and in no uncertain terms that we will not be working with Elbid again and we have stopped
	So please leave our trucks and our offices alone the email concluded."

	"In 1977, the US was helping Indonesia carry out its genocide of 170,000 people in East
	Timor.
	And in order to do that, they wanted to transfer fighter jets to the Indonesian Army.
	But the US Congress blocked Jimmy Carter.
	And so instead, Kissinger in the State Department had Israel give Indonesia the fighter jets.
	And we just gave Israel more fighter jets, which has never been a problem for our Congress.
	The way the US has used Israel to get around sanctions, whether it's Rhodesia, Nauz,
	and Babwe, or apartheid South Africa.
	There were sanctions against the Guadalajunta and the Argentina Nionazi Hunta that we didn't
	want to violate as a non-pariestate.
	So we had our Pryace State fund and arm the genocide dares in South America and Central
	America for us."

	"Right now we're materially engaged in ending this war on Palestine. Elbit is
	Israel's largest drone manufacturer and drones and weapons in general our
	Israel's largest export. These drones are flying over Gaza as we speak and
	they're being manufactured here in England as we speak and Palestine action has
	been the last three years waging an all-out sabotage campaign against every
	facet of Elbit's business here. We are determined to shut them down and we have
	a very specific direct action strategy that has been consistently delivering
	benchmark results on our way to full victory. You can listen to our full episode

	"Israel has always been more than willing to participate through funding and
	training and arming US genocides of which there are truly dozens that I'm sure
	your listeners are more familiar than most with but Israel's role that has
	always been sort of subtle and we like sort of get lost in conversations about
	like the lobby and who is leading who here but it's always been Israel doing
	the particular dirty work of US Empire and in this particular genocide that
	we're seeing in 2024 it's just the one that's most close to Israel shores but
	this has been the Israel-American MO for four decades for five decades for
	six decades. You can listen to our full episode with Max Geller by subscribing

	"That's an amazing victory.
	And there's only four more companies in the UK that Elbit can hire before they have
	a serious decision to make.
	And leaving aside the fact that Elbit can relocate, you know, I would counter with what
	a headache that would be, think about what's possible, think about the message we will send
	around the world that a group of committed activists willing to alter their strategy
	engage in a years-long campaign against Israel's biggest weapons company and one.
	That's what's at stake here, a true redefining of what's possible for our movement worldwide.
