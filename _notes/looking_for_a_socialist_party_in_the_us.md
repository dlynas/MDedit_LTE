## Looking for a Socialist Party in the US

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism_101/comments/1be9d6y/looking_for_a_socialist_party_in_the_us/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism_101/comments/1be9d6y/looking_for_a_socialist_party_in_the_us/)

> I'm done with the Democrat/Republican duopoly in America. I have found that they are two sides of the same coin, sold out to corporate and special interests. Both are warmongers and borderline fascism. And, both continue to oppress the working class. I'm ready to get behind a third party alternative, namely a socialist party and candidate. I have found there to be so many to choose from in the US: Socialist Equality Party (SEP), Socialist Alternative (SA), Democratic Socialist of America (DSA), Socialist Party USA, Freedom Socialist Party (FSP), World Socialist Party US, Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL). I've looked at all of these and each have their pros and cons. I know no political party is perfect, but are there any others than can be recommended?

	I’ve only really heard of the DSA, PSL, and World Socialist Party USA. To my understanding the World Socialist Party is fairly defunct at this point. The DSA and PSL are pretty good, just understand that the PSL is explicitly Marxist-Leninist and the DSA is a big tent party, which can be frustrating.

		The DSA is not a big tent party. They're for downwardly mobile liberals who like unions.
		
		In my local chapter, an anarchist friend of mine recommended they let the individual districts(? I forget the term. Whatever regional subdivision of the Metro area) vote for their representation and him and about 40 of his friends were purged.
		
		This guy was a legit socialist who had won a primary for local office with the Democrats and works hard at organizing and not only did they purge him and blame him of embezzlement (which was absurd) but also doxxed him in their newsletter, with his full address.
		
		This is after they tried to co-opt black leftist groups in the area, effectively scuttled them, and then denied they did anything wrong. The DSA has an awful reputation among leftists in my area.

			I’ve heard similar things. As a ML I think it’s just a party of liberals and spicy liberals; I’m just trying to be more fair.

	I would join the one that had the most active and smart branch local to you.

	I’m a part of FRSO and love it, highly recommend looking into it. They’re bigger in some cities than others but basically every major American city has a chapter. They were almost destroyed by the FBI in 2010, which shows they are clearly a threat to the powers that be which I look at as a plus. Their program can be read online for free

	You can also give RCA Revolutionary Communists of America and CPUSA Communist Party USA a look.

		The CPUSA is always a good starting point, many famous American socialists and communists have come from and worked with them. Angela Davis being my usual example. Havent heard of the RCA, gonna have to do some research

			RCA is a relaunch of the US section International Marxist Tendency. There’s branches in most big cities, but they are quite small, with less than 1000 members within the US. Though growing quickly thanks to freak outs by right wing pundits over their launch rally in NYC.

			* 🟦 **[xrat-engineer](https://www.reddit.com/user/xrat-engineer)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-03-14 20:00:00)_

				We also have relatively large numbers in Dallas, Phoenix, Atlanta, Bellingham... Literally started by one guy in Fargo so, write in, maybe we have a branch near you!
				
				Also we were growing quickly before the launch, going from less than 400 to over 600 in a few months based on our "are you a Communist" campaign. While some credit is owed to the right wingers we've been mostly growing under our own steam and the general need in society for our ideas

					Oh, I’m already an active member. 
					
					We are also now at 700! The LA area is doing a lot of growth as well with all the protests out here.

						That was more like tack on info intended for the person you were replying to, but awesome! Yeah I should be a bit more religious on reading the bulletins, I'm out in NYC and I appear in the video (I'm wearing a Lenin shirt)

	That covers most of them, though you are missing FRSO and WWP.

	Sorry to complicate your list even more.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 5 _(2024-03-14 12:01:29)_

	I'm in the early stages of joining PSL, good experience so far. They are very effective organizers and I appreciate the Democratic Centralist party structure, which avoids much of the internal conflict between multiple factions like in the DSA, which frequently disrupts or precludes effective party business.

	But as others said, prioritize groups that are close to you, whose meetings and events you can attend in person on a regular basis.

	* 🟨 **[AlbMonk](https://www.reddit.com/user/AlbMonk) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-18 12:26:19)_

		I'm leaning toward PSL too. Just yesterday I spoke with a representative from PSL Pittsburgh, and we meshed pretty well. They are aggressive and organized. And, I like that.

* 🟩 **[Ganem1227](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ganem1227)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-03-14 13:30:41)_

	I would suggest CPUSA, DSA, PSL, or FRSO. I’m a CPUSA member but I have positive opinions of all four.

	The DSA is a must have in your network, whether or not you join them. Make friends with the local, they’re great if you need boots on the ground or contacts.

* 🟩 **[Possible_Result5848](https://www.reddit.com/user/Possible_Result5848)** ⬆️ 4 _(2024-03-15 16:59:30)_

	i don’t honestly recommend any of the parties here in the sense that i’m a die hard for them, but i’d suggest DSA. 

	all of them have issues, all of them have large sections of colonial chauvinists, but at least DSA is a big tent. like others have mentioned this can be frustrating, but ime it’s more frustrating to abide by democratic centralism in a party that pushes colonial chauvinism. 

	PSL for example acknowledges US colonialism but has no wish to see true decolonization, [just colonialism under new leadership](https://pslweb.org/program/) (check the section “Liberation: Overcoming racism, exploitation, national oppression and all forms of bigotry”, they say that they’ll give native nations self determination on the mainland and give their territories back, but this implies that their socialist government would be separated from indigenous inhabitants of the land as if no native person is proletarian). they’re also [notorious](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14wF1Ti5GT2w5GZmwqvhvk6uH4zUss_a-B2GZ9NZEx74/mobilebasic) for defending shitty people. people within PSL may recognize this, but since there’s actual party discipline they are unable to voice these sentiments without being kicked out. 

	now that’s not to say no org should have party discipline ever, but imo it’s better to not have it when the party is colonial. there’s a lot of chapters in DSA moving toward actual decolonial politics, and if they can gain precedence then having an org of potentially 10,000s of people following a national branch that operates in that way could be good

	edit- if nothing else it’s a good place to form a solid chapter and then merge off into a more revolutionary org

	Of cause everyone here will now start to tell you that their Party is of cause the best and that you should join them. So you will more or less have gained zero information. 😅

	Thing is all of them are relativly smal. So a lot depends on if they got members in your area at all. Otherwise it is kind of pointless anyway. Usually that narrows it down quite a lot. Get in contact with them, talk to them, read some of their texts and papers, find out if you feel at home. Take a few month. This will most likely lead you to the decission that will be right for you

	So, I think the thing to remember is that, like with so many things in life, you have to work with what you have. Contrary to popular opinion, I've heard (and agree with) the description of the USA electoral system working *too* well, in that we get the politicians we (as a country) *deserve*. Not the ones we want or need. Leftists are a growing share of the electorate, but nowhere near enough to get a meaningful share of Congress at this time (let alone the presidency).

	In particular, I think something a lot of us forget is that left-wing ideologies, being opposed to hierarchy, don't lend themselves well to top-down approaches, such as winning the executive branch while the legislative branch is dominated by the status quo. Since we seek to derive legitimacy from representing the will of the workers, we should embrace the bottom-up approach, which, in terms of electoral politics, means going hard on who you WANT for local elections (and sometimes state elections on a case-by-case basis), but taking what you CAN get at the federal level. This will obviously have exceptions by district, but as a general rule, you're not playing into our strengths by trying to enact top-down change when there is a big gap between where the electorate is at and where you want it to be.

	The takeaway being that just as you can't transmute lead into gold, so, too, can we not fill high-level (federal election) offices in the USA get filled with D/R with the current electorate.

	So, while I don't have a good suggestion for political groups, I do urge you to accept what cannot (yet) be changed and vote D for those races where there is no getting what we actually want/need. Because, sadly, top-down *does* work for our far-right opposition since they are status quo (if not regressive), and they benefit from "trickle-down conservatism" by pushing the Overton Window farther right, and are quite fine with disregarding ostensible values in favor of the pursuit of power (which also fits in with a top-down strategy). 

	Admittedly, there is a bit of a counterexample to this in Bernie Sanders, who, as an independent left of the main parties, stood a real chance of winning the general election in 2016 vs Trump, but he still needed legitimacy from Democratic support on the federal level to do that, which meant that him getting to the general election was always a long shot.

		Ranked choice isn't going to be enough, unfortunately, if the voter base is still right wing . In a country like the USA, for example, all it's going to do is reduce the variance (spread) of candidates as measured by their location on the political spectrum. If you want an example of this, look no further than the Houston, TX mayoral election: There was a (nominally) progressive, centrist, and some also ran. The centrist won, and it occurred to me that if there had been a conservative contender in the race, it would possibly have taken votes from the centrist, allowing the (nominal) progressive to win, but ranked choice voting would have simply assured the centrist's victory.
