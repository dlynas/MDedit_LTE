## So, you want to build an Indie MMORPG? A counter point to negativity.

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/6yntgu/so_you_want_to_build_an_indie_mmorpg_a_counter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/6yntgu/so_you_want_to_build_an_indie_mmorpg_a_counter/)

> I am going to play Devil's Advocate here; while it is impossible to build an AAA-style MMORPG as a solo indie, or even as a small team, I am going to point out something that a lot of people seem to be missing: There are plenty of MMORPGs out there that have been built by 1 or 2 people teams; some have existed for a decade or more, and survive healthily on an active user base of a few thousand (or even few hundred) players because the players are passionate about the game or the community built around the game. Again, let me re-emphasize, because someone is going to go off on a tangent about AAAs here out of envy or something, no, you won't be able to create an AAA MMORPG, but you can still create a MMORPG and find a small measure of success in the indie field. It might not be an easy project to tackle, per se, and like every other genre of game... you are likely to not have any measure of popularity-- but for someone to say you can't create one is either a person not playing many indie MMORPGs and seeing what can be done by a dedicated person, or purposely ignoring the fact that indie MMORPGs actually do exist and can find their own measure of success at all. 
>   
>   
> Yes, there is the whole tiring meme of young and inexperienced people who have no clue about programming that want to build a MMORPG... and yes, it's a long climb up the mountain if you're standing at the very bottom of it. However, on the flip side, people will say ridiculous things like, "AAA studios have the genre locked down so you can't build one, it's useless!" Well, in that case, don't build a FPS, because they have that genre locked down as well. Don't build a survival game, because they have that genre locked down too. Also, don't even think about building a RPG at all, because they also have that genre locked down hard. Platformers, too. In fact, don't build any game at all, because every genre is completely locked down by all the AAA studios and your game will never find anyone to play it. You might as well take your ball and go home, you're done as an indie game developer, AAAs will prevent you from doing everything forever.

> Haven and Hearth is one such MMO. It has 1 artist and 1 coder, it's been around for at least a decade; in perpetual development, but it's a complete game, and already has more crafting depth and play-ability than any AAA MMORPG I have ever come across. If you love casual crafting and survival games, Haven and Hearth puts any AAA to shame in that respect.

>   
> There are many more than these two, and new ones pop up all the time, but these are two I have played at length, myself, at one point or another. However, how these two indie examples exist is just beyond inexplicable, it's a mystery to be fathomed that will never be understood by any game dev on the planet on how they came to be with the tidal wave of AAA MMORPGs that have dominated the industry for decades... except maybe because someone decided one day that, "I'm going to build a MMORPG" and ignored the negativity and the criticism and just did it because they *could*... sometimes, that's all it takes. A goal, a direction, and a bit of determination.
>    
>   
> Okay, so let's just say it together, "If you really want to build a MMORPG, and if you have the dedication to doing it, you can build a MMORPG."
> 
>   
> I've done a fair bit of research into the indie MMORPG genre because I wanted to know what made them survive without the over-arching stories and quests and hundreds of hours of content... and there were just a few key similarities to what they shared, despite game/theme differences:
>   
>   
> 1) Successful indie MMORPGs don't find their success on story or heavy questing, they seem to find their success on player-driven content and making players be the center of crafting and production; in essence, giving players significant control in the world instead of forcing the world onto them. The players are an integral part of the world, instead of just experiencing it. This is something AAA studios don't do... because 'everyone' is a hero experiencing the world in the same way, but not so much in the indie MMORPG world. The players are more central to the game than the game is to itself.
>   
>   
> 2) Instead of aiming for wide audiences and popular appeal, they seem to (intentionally or unintentionally) aim for niche audiences that won't find a similar style of play elsewhere easily. There are hundreds of WoW clones or EverQuest clones by AAA (both bad and good)... but, try finding a Haven and Hearth clone... you won't, it's unique. This is something an indie or hobbyist can actually bank on. AAA needs to go with a formula that appeals to mass popularity because they bankroll millions of dollars into their productions... an indie MMORPG can be more niche and even afford to bank on that niche because people are more apt to pay for and support something in the longterm that fulfills their niche that won't be fulfilled anywhere else.
>   
> 3) Tight knit communities are important for small success, where everyone knows everyone else and when people make friends and have a reliance on each other... it creates a sense of responsibility to stay to help those friends. In an AAA MMORPGs, it's easy enough to replace a player with a new player, because there's a huge population to draw from. In an indie MMORPG, not so much. This creates a sense of responsibility for players to stay and help their friends... because a person likes to feel important, and in the indie MMORPG every person in a team counts. This seems to help keep a long term draw in a much smaller player base.
>   
>   
> 4) And probably the most important thing I've learned from my observations; successful indie MMORPGs give a solid single-player experience that's as enjoyable playing alone as it is with other people. It gives you 'something to do' aside from grinding or farming XP. They give you something to work for or attain outside of leveling... and makes it difficult for you want to give up on what you worked for. Haven and Hearth, also, does this spectacular. In typical MMORPGs, you can level up your character, log out, and come back years later... you are where you left off. In Haven and Hearth, you build something in the world... if you log out and come back even months later, what you built will have long decayed. The single player experience in the multiplayer world becomes a time sink investment... and you want to keep what you've worked hard on.
>   
>   
> Once you combine these four aspects, you seem to have the recipe for a potentially successful indie MMORPG... and what it comes down to then, is implementing it into a theme people will enjoy via the mechanics.
>   
> Which, brings me to more points of contention that people talk about in regards to MMORPGs.
>   
>   
> 1) A MMORPG has to have uber graphics to be enjoyable. So, what now? No. Just no. You don't have to invest millions of dollars in graphics to have an enjoyable game, you just need an enjoyable game. You can have meh graphics and still build a loyal audience. There's no reason you cannot build a 2D or low poly 3D MMORPG and find success with limited graphics. It's been done, over and over. The problem with realistic graphics (in any genre)... the more realistic you go, the less forgiving people become about the flaws and criticisms for those graphics. Meanwhile, if you aim for low poly or LoFi, people are far less likely to criticize for things such as textures or animations... because they don't seem to be out of place. And with a little practice in a 3D modeling program; if you go low poly, no texture and just rely on lighting, there's no reason you cannot bang out a dozen or two assets a day. Also, why are you rushing? Build your assets as you need them... which brings me to point 2.
>   
>   
> 2) Perpetual Production. You never have to be done, you can start simple and evolve. This is how most indie MMORPGs have survived. Again, Haven and Hearth is the perfect example; it started small, and became slowly more intricate over the years through iteration and additions. It didn't start off with such a large scope... it started small. RuneScape started as a MUD and built on that by slowly adding graphics and then becoming the popular MMORPG that it is. And unlike AAA studios which mostly focus on the grind formula, if you make your MMORPG player central and allow them to build things... there's less pressure on you to constantly provide new content, because they are providing the content. Give the players the mechanics and they can make hella diverse content for you, instead of relying on you.
>   
>   
> 3) Building a MMORPG server isn't difficult (we're not talking about networking engineering here, just to sooth some people, we are talking about server code). (edit: making a correction, thanks peeps!) The term MMORPG was coined by Richard Garriot, and an Ultima Online Shard which could handle 300 players (which, for a tile based MMO that isn't syncing physics and isn't high energy is still small bananas). The biggest secret that people will never tell you because some people either never tried or they want it to seem way, way, way, way more complicated than it really is to protect some self-perceived arcane knowledge... in comparison to building an actual game (of any sort, even a one level platformer or puzzle game); client<>server communication is much easier. A server isn't some magical unknown creation; it really only does a few simple things... it takes data from clients and passes it to other clients and processes any commands sent by the client. So, you know, if you think about it, the server is pretty much doing exactly what a single player game does in just a slightly different way. Now, again, if you need a huge massive player base and need to spin up and spin down instances and do load balancing, etc... that gets a bit more complicated. But, for a simple indie MMORPG that is running less than a dozen shards... no, it's not really many more steps complicated than a single player game. 
>   
>   
> Of course, I don't want to make it seem like everything is sunshine and roses and that there won't be road blocks, or stumps, or hindrances, or challenges... because there will be. Oh, will there ever be... just like any other game genre you will pull your hair, kick your computer, curse at your code, and find yourself in a self-perpetuating crisis, but, these are the exact same challenges you would face designing any other genre of game. 
>   
>   
> In the end, it is like building any other game; what you get out of it is what you put into it, and it's not a mountainous, impossible climb. It can be done, others have done it before you and have found their success, so why not you?
>   
>   
> My experience comes from this viewpoint: I have played and fell in love with some indie MMORPGs over the years (Haven and Hearth being the most notable that I return to time and time again). And I, myself, am currently building the impossible to build MMORPG that no indie can ever build alone based on what I've said in this post: an impossible task, yet, somehow I've managed to do the networking portion alone, I've miraculously completed an entire tile/voxel engine, by myself, that uses the networking portion to stream maps to players... and I'm not exactly an expert programmer here, there are many more people who can do this way, way, way better than I ever could... yet, I, as an average programmer... can, and I'm learning so much in the process. So, if I can do it, why not you? And if nothing else, how many indie people ever dare to earn the ability to say, "Hey man, yeah, I built a game on my own, it's a MMORPG." 
> 
>   
> Of course, I can't promise you that you'll be successful. I can't promise you that your indie MMORPG will be a hit, or that you won't fail hard, even in the indie scene. I can't promise you that there'll be any profit or any measure of success in the endeavor. I can't even promise you that anyone will play it. But, these are the things stacked against you in every genre you make. But, I can tell you one thing... despite the supposed (and highly imaginary) AAA lockdown of the genre, there is an audience for niche, indie MMORPGs, and people are less likely to compete with you or clone you because any time someone has the desire to build a MMORPG they get quashed by the naysayers who never dared to dream big. I will promise you one thing, from my own experience, you will learn a lot, and that experience is invaluable.
>   
>   
> In the end, you will get out of it what you put into it, and your determination (or lack of) will either help you or hinder you. So, take in the constructive criticism of those who are telling you what you will be facing... but, put your hand up to the face of the naysayers, and just freakin' follow your dream. It's YOUR dream, YOUR risk, YOUR time... only you know what you can do with your own time and determination.

	>client&lt;>server communication is much easier.

	I don't agree with this, but I'll say something: One of my first attempts at game development (still in high school) was an MMO in RPG Maker XP. Less than 20 people played it, but it was a success for me. I learnt A LOT and discovered my passion. 

	Since then I focus my career in the network aspect and now I work in AAA games. So yeah, if you want to do an MMO, go ahead.

		Thank you, I needed to hear this. I have been dealing with so much crap from people telling me every idea I have is bad because of some reason that, to me, makes no sense, that it's actually pretty heartwarming to hear someone actually just do something they love and make it work.
		
		I change projects a few times a year because of a reason or another, often because of outside influences, but I usually don't do so willingly. It's more about the circumstances changing and me wanting to make it work some other way. Nowadays I'm mocked for "always changing projects". I am going to my next project pretty soon, and I am going to be sure to make it the way I want to, rather than listening to other people telling me it's bad.

			constructive criticism is always welcome, but is YOUR project and its meant to be like YOU want, dont forget that.
			
			starting new projects often is not a bad thing if you learn something new on each one, but be sure to (half)finish at least one every now and then!

				Oh, I do get a ton of work done on each project. In fact, my last few projects "failed" but with them I managed to create a card game development kit for Unity that is pretty unique, and has survived each and every single game, confirming to me that this new method of development (making tools and a game kit for a particular genre as I make that game) does work.
				
				I spent 2 years making prototypes and other things with this card game kit and they generally look good and play nicely as well.

			People assume making a game means you want to make money. For many indies, that's just not true. Know what your goal is at the end of the day.

			* 🟦 **[LittleCodingFox](https://www.reddit.com/user/LittleCodingFox)** ⬆️ 7 _(2017-09-07 16:55:59)_

				Even if it is to make money, it makes no sense to say stuff like "You shouldn't make a game in genre X because you gotta beat every single game in that genre". it's not like you only ever play the one game in that genre. By that logic, why make Minecraft? You gotta beat Oblivion or something.
				
				This is something I am sadly dealing with regularly. I keep getting responses that I feel are completely wrong or misguided.

					I see this a lot as well. But me making a game that isn't anything new to the genre is what led to me getting a new job, even if the game itself isn't anything new or groundbreaking.

					* 🟥 **[LittleCodingFox](https://www.reddit.com/user/LittleCodingFox)** ⬆️ 3 _(2017-09-07 17:25:27)_

						From my experience, it doesn't even have to be anything new or groundbreaking. Minecraft, which is basically the most popular game of all time (or so i heard), started off as a toy, a hobby for Notch. It eventually grew into this amazing thing that it is nowadays.
						
						But in either case, you don't HAVE to make something amazing. just make something you enjoy. chances are, you'll find other people who enjoy your work.

								Exactly, and my current project is based on Staxel (at least on the idea of a voxel farm game with "3D pixel art"), so it's not a super original idea, but it has its own unique side to it (for instance, I am going to eventually try to add a lot more content to it for all kinds of players once I reach a stage I think is good, I'm going to follow Bartle's Taxonomy of Player Types, you can find more info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types).

				I like this a lot...... I feel like this has been lost for most of the big companies now a days back when making a game was art and passion and people cared about what they put out and the money came from people enjoying your game and everyone wanting to buy your game. and as much as people say that we still play into the AAA money grab, we have to look at the boom of indie games I think its a slow statement but I think this is why indie games are making it into the big times now. Because passion is shown in the indie game world where as (not saying all but this stupid money grabs are taking so much precedence). This is what has recently gotten me into looking into getting into game development. Miss the days of 50 dollars for a well made passionate game.

			Sometimes, that's what you have to do, do what you want to do... especially if you're just learning or are hobbyist, there's no reason for you to not do what you want to do then. Create the game you want to play first.

			Build something with placeholder graphics, show you have something already done... once you actually have something to show, I think it would be easier for an artist to come on your side. Because they will see you have a working game and that you just need art to finish it.

		Dofus says hi!
		
		Started by three French guys, nowadays Ankama (named after the three founders) is a company with hundreds of employees, editing comic books, making TV cartoons and even some movies, on top of video games.
		We are not talking about the eighties or something here. They released their MMORPG in 2004. Sure, they started with simple PvP game, but the point is: three devs, one MMORPG (in Flash, of all things)
		
		Why did they succeed? They had solid gameplay, in a tactical RPG style. And amazing graphics (all initially done by the one guy) with a very unique style (French manga, to put it simply) and *humour*. Endless supply of puns and quirky characters. All with a fairly unique IP. Not quite your traditional fantasy. More like French comical fantasy.
		But to repeat : the core gameplay is profoundly satisfying, like a boardgame. I don't think the rest would help off that hadn't been there.

		We're pretty far away from my definition of "massively multiplayer" :P
		
		I think the main problem with the whole MMO debate is people are arguing weather it's possible or not. I don't like to read threads about it on this subreddit because it's always exactly the same. If you can do it you probably won't even think about posting about it here asking for help. If you ask it means you can't even estimate how hard it is to actually get to the end (edit: implying for a viable commercial product, not a pet project).
		
		Anyway, you built a project, you learnt, and everything is good because this allowed you to go forward and it paid off. People should try to replicate your success instead of trying to replicate Notch's success.

					I know it's not the same thing, but you can still make your dream happen by simply lowering your scope (like, local multiplayer or even up to 10 people or so, and making all art in cubes/voxels), focusing on a particular thing you want done until you're satisfied with the bare minimums (like, say, a harvest moon-style game), and once (and if) you reach that, you can start considering adding content and features. The whole goal is to make the game "doable", but also allowing for additional content if you reach the sweet spot. It's what I'm doing for my next project!

There is just an idea I had come up with a while ago trying out all the MMOs out there thinking you know....this is missing this....eventually i put them all together into a game idea. However it is huge, and very complex. I have no illusion of being able to build it, unless I manage to some how get myself into a AAA and they some how listen to my idea and decide to run with it.

							You can start in small steps. one feature at a time. when all features are done, you can start producing more content. this is especially good if you do it this way because if something doesn't work, you can just drop it. If each feature is independent, or depends only on already existing features, it is a lot easier to add/remove than if you make the whole game about them from the start. Essentially, you gotta start from the low end (just making the world exist and be traversable), and then start adding things slowly, one at a time.
							
							And remember, unless you're doing it for money, you got plenty of time to make those features :)

								But I couldn't do the artwork. I could probably code a lot of it, but when it comes down the art I would be at a loss. The game world I have envisioned far out scales that of WoW. I want it to be the actual Earth. Use google maps to map out and design the entire earth. I am not even sure if a server can hold that big of a map. lol Don't get me wrong though I appreciate the encouragement but I don't plan to try to build this game on my own. I will settle with my much smaller mobile games I have planned :)

									Actually, you can do that fairly easily nowadays. you can use services like MapBox to create your own map from the real world. Also, regarding the art, you can always either learn to pixel art, or use something like Qubicle Constructor to make something "3D Pixel Art"-ish!
									
									Sounds to me like you'll want to use procedural generation a ton tho. Which should simplify your work a lot, because you can just use code for most of the world :)

										This is kind of what I'm doing-- recognized my limits of not being able to create a massive hand painted world, so I thought to myself, "What is within my capabilities to build?"
										  
										  
										With that, I built a tile and voxel based engine. There's a world map that, starting out, will be about 100x100 tiles... people will travel along this world map... some tiles will just be obstacles (like mountains, ocean, etc) but most other tiles will be 'enterable'; where the server streams down a "mini" voxel map with limits of about 50x50x20... these areas will be like forests, small streams, rivers, quarries, places to mine resources and build homesteads. 
										  
										The world map will be painted by hand... but the underlying voxel regions will be procedurally generated based on the 2D tile that represents that area.
										  
										This will allow me to build a massive world to start with using very little resources.

		Hell yeah. I had the same exact experience.
		
		I started to really learn how to program in highschool. My big goal was to break into game development, but my biggest short term goal was to make a game that had non-local multiplayer. Not for the pizazz but simply because I found the idea incredibly fascinating.
		
		That project ended up being my focus for almost two years, by the time I was done I had a really nice full featured network game that I was proud of.  It truly was the launching point for me as a programmer. Up till then I had been fumbling around trying to put anything together I could, not really thinking through my choices. To achieve anything networked I had to actually UNDERSTAND everything I was doing, or it was never going to work.
		
		I learned so much from working on something like that, something I knew was way over my head. So I wholeheartedly agree, if you want to make an MMO or just a multiplayer game in general do it! Keep your expectations reasonable, but dive in! You'll never regret it! It strikes a good balance of game programming and engineering for someone trying to become a more comfortable programmer.

				Encouraging people to be realistic is not negative, and if you want to look at it from a real-world perspective then what you're doing by buying into the "you can do anything" mentality is significantly more negative in terms of how the people end up feeling in the long run are concerned.
				
				I get really annoyed when people come along and encourage people to chase after absurdly unrealistic goals that will do nothing except lead to disappointment/failure, and then sit and act as though anyone who doesn't is negative or trying to "keep people down".  
				
				That's nonsense.  It's just sad when people go about things entirely the wrong way and set themselves up for failure, and some of us would rather give those people a healthy dose of reality BEFORE they do that in the hopes that they will either re-evaluate their goals or at the very least approach them in a logical manner.
				
				If someone wants to make an MMORPG you don't do it by just setting out to make one, you have to build the fundamental elements first:
				
				- Create a workable underlying RPG system.  I.E. a pen and paper combat system that is functional, balanced, fair and fun.  If you can't do this then you can't design the underlying system required for an MMORPG either, because behind the scenes that's how leveling, combat, itemization, stats, etc *all* function.
				
				- Create a setting/world that is interesting and captivating.  I.E. a good dose of world-building through creative writing that  captures the imagination.  If I don't care about your world or it sounds/looks like every other piece of fan-fiction on the internet then players won't want to "live" there.
				
				- Create an interface that is intuitive, functional and elegant.  I.E. a working application that allows interaction with the world in a manner that is both flexible and easy to use. 
				
				- Create a server/engine capable of handling a large number of players in a secure and high-performance environment.  I.E. a heavily customized version of a commercial engine such as UE4 paired with an enterprise level database solution and the robust code to make it all work.
				
				I could go on, but this is just the START... and if you can't accomplish *each one* of those: you will *NEVER* make an MMORPG.  That's not negative, that's reality.

		For my own anecdote, I worked on a pretty popular indie game that had online multiplayer functionality. Not MMO, just up to 4 players online. Out of my two years at the company I think it's fair to say bugwise over 66% of my time was spent fixing online online multiplayer bugs. Part of the multiplayer experience was just simple round based fighting such that online code was simple lockstep type stuff.

		Threads about MUD creation are usually reserved to /r/MUD where they belong. But yeah, that would be the first step. I'll argue that if you can't make a MUD, there is no way in hell you can make an MMO.
		
		Also... it doesn't help that younger generations simply don't have a clue about what a MUD is. They just don't know of anything older than EQ, or sometimes even WoW. They can't imagine anything smaller and text-based, because they don't even know it exists. Yet somehow they think they know exactly what's wrong with the genre and they have that great idea that will save it all, even when their brand-new great idea is, in fact, an old idea that was proven not to work long ago...

		If you can build a MUD, you can build a MMORPG. The only difference between the two; one streams descriptions of rooms and objects through a wall of long winded text... the other sends short commands to represent locations of players and objects which are then rendered with graphics.

				Guess what? Networking aspects were complete awhile ago, just finished the server-side world engine the other day, the last couple days were the saving/loading aspects of the world and region maps, and caching of client side maps and what the server needs to do to keep maps updated for all relevant connections.
				
				Strangely, the network code between the two is almost identical... both use sockets in the exact same way... unless of course, you know how to write a server in a different way that doesn't involve a socket listening on an open port, receiving data into a buffer, sending that data to the game process, and then responding with the results to the player........

	Two things:

	1) You're being a *little* generous with using the moniker MMORPG, which typically refers to a game with a large/persistent world that can handle thousands of concurrent players.  MUDs (which is what Runescape started as) were online RPGs and would not have been considered massively multiplayer.  I'm not familiar with this "Haven and Hearth" game you repeatedly hold up as an example, but it doesn't even have a Wikipedia entry and so I'm confident in saying that it doesn't meet the size/scale of what would be considered massively multiplayer and therefore represents and online multiplayer RPG and nothing more or less.

	2) You are **grossly** oversimplifying the role/complexity of what a server needs to do with regards to an MMORPG.  It isn't just passing around data and commands, it is also where all of the critical information and calculations need to be handled in order to prevent abuse and that is just the tip of the iceberg.  There is also something to be said for the impact of scale on performance and I'm sorry, but there is no way that an indie developer or small team could create a *good* and *secure* server capable of handling thousands of players.  Full stop, no question.

	This giant post looks to me like you're trying to justify your own pursuit instead of making a purely logical argument.  I disagree with you emphatically, and while I can appreciate your passion and understand completely having a dream... it's bad to delude yourself and to encourage others ignore to reality by chasing after absurdly impractical goals.

	Here's what I normally tell people interested in creating an RPG (MMO or otherwise): go create an entirely original pen and paper role-playing system and publish it.  If you can't successfully accomplish that... then you have absolutely no chance of successfully creating a *decent* RPG, because the core gameplay systems of an RPG are exactly the same.  So if you can't make a balanced, logical, functional and *FUN* pen and paper system then you will have even less success making the interactive, digital and graphical version.

				Because there's enough heavy discouragement in the indie community when tackling such a thing too; even by experienced programmers. In fact, people just 'assume' someone's experience level from the getgo... assuming someone is a 'newbie' to everything, I see it constantly.
				  
				Also, small, indie MMORPGs exist. So, that's not even a point of contention.

		Your argument applies to every genre, "If you can't make it on the scale X, then why make it at all."
		  
		Well, you can't make Doom. Stop making FPS shooters, etc.
		  
		Also define a "large persistent" world? Is it size? Is it detail? 
		  
		I think the thing is, you have a skewed concept of what a MMORPG *should* be, and not what they actually are. Your entire definition is based on the percentage of MMORPGs that are AAA, while ignore the huge chunk that are not.

			> Your argument applies to every genre, "If you can't make it on the scale X, then why make it at all."  Well, you can't make Doom. Stop making FPS shooters, etc.
			
			That isn't at *ALL* what I'm saying.  I'm saying that the *approach* people take to pursuing these sorts of games, especially RPGs is unrealistic and foolish.  I'm not saying that wanting to make that kind of game is foolish, clearly you have to start *somewhere*.
			
			Also, I think you *could* make Doom.  If you ignore multiplayer for a moment Doom is just a pretty FPS with basic gameplay and a well-defined theme.  Using a modern engine like UE4 the graphical quality (assuming you had a competent 3D artist) would be absolutely possible.  The game-play is pretty straight-forward (there aren't classes, you don't level up, weapons aren't customizable, etc).
			
			All in all: Doom would be (for a AAA title) a pretty reasonable choice to attempt to emulate.
			
			> Also define a "large persistent" world? Is it size? Is it detail? 
			
			Both.  It's a general descriptor that is also tied in to the size of player-base that it can accommodate and the range of activities that you can engage in.  Some online games are large and open but have a very narrow range of activities, or very little interaction, etc.  
			
			> I think the thing is, you have a skewed concept of what a MMORPG should be, and not what they actually are. Your entire definition is based on the percentage of MMORPGs that are AAA, while ignore the huge chunk that are not.
			
			Not at all.  I'm simply making the distinction between an online multiplayer role-playing game and a *massively* multiplayer online role-playing game.  The difference is in the SCALE it is meant to handle.  
			
			If you're talking about a couple hundred players then I'm sorry but it's *not* "massively" multiplayer.  Neverwinter Nights was an online multiplayer role-playing game, Everquest was a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.  
			
			There could have been millions of people playing the former but they were not in one large world where thousands of players would be immersed in the *same* world.  I'm not even talking about quality, I'm simply talking about size/scale.

		Well, since this thread is about playing devil's advocate, literally the first code I ever wrote was an isometric world engine that supported variable tile sizes, slopes, infinite layers with proper collision detection, and a depth sorting system that dealt with all this accurately.
		
		It was the single hardest thing I'd ever attempted. Little did I know that isometric depth sorting in pure 2D is a challenge that even veteran game developers struggle with, and I was trying to conquer it *while learning to program*. I had to do *weeks* of intense study on a variety of subjects to learn how, and most of that time was spent wanting to pull my hair out.
		
		But I still did it. The code was amateur as heck and stupidly unoptimized, but it worked, and I learned more about math and logic in those few weeks than my entire highschool education.
		
		I have yet to actually make an isometric game, but that doesn't matter. The knowledge I gained from trying propelled me on to bigger and better things. And if I ever do want to make an isometric game, I'm confident I could build a pretty darn good engine for it now.

	I think it's worth noting that the original inspiration for MMORPGs were MUDs, which people definitely did create on their own using MUD engines like CircleMUD or MUSH or any of the many, many others. Habbo Hotel and those sorts of games are MMORPGs by some definition. 

	I feel like when people say "indies can't make MMORPGs", they mean "indies can't make World of Warcraft", which is certainly true, but indies can and *have* made MMO games. Indies have to manage their scale - MMO is a contributor to scale, but it is not so huge that it is completely out of reach.

	In fact, quite frankly, the problem with an indie trying to make WoW has a *lot* more to do with the scope of creative content than the mere fact that it's an MMO. Indies would be foolish to attempt to replicate single-player Witcher as well.

	I think an MMORPG is within reach of indie developers by approaching some of the core problems from the opposite direction to what instinct suggests. E.g. instead of worrying about how you will synchronize 50 servers streaming 30 UDP packets per second to 100,000 users with 80 ms latency across the Atlantic, just forget it. Set a target like 500 bytes per 2 seconds over TCP, and then decide what kind of mechanics you can implement with those constraints. Now you can host your first 1,000 players on an old laptop. Statistically, you won't ever have to worry about what comes next, but if you do, you'll be doing it based on a lot of player testing and feedback.

	This resonates with me also because I've been always appalled by the approach of tripple-A studios, where millions are spent on graphics that go down the pipe because the game design just doesn't hold up for more than a single play-through (if at all). 

	What do you think about EvE Online in this context? It's certainly not 'indie', but otherwise it's something to be inspired by, in fact, I am hoping to create something one could theoretically call a 'fantasy-based EvE game'. To date, I've been working on it for some 6 years, and I am hoping to make a certain evolution-principle work. Just hope that my original choice of technology will hold up (Java, LibGdx) despite the Unity-storm.

			As a lifelong gamer, AAA MMOs have always been excellent, you just needed to find what made that particular game good. In almost no case was the gameplay itself (alone) the "good enough" factor to make it worth playing. You yourself outlined this in the beginning comment stating that successful indies focused on player interaction, but what you messed up was stating that wasn't the case for AAA mmo's. In nearly every case I can think of, it was the community that made it excellent.
			
			As for carving out your own space in the world- that's the opposite of your original post. Now, carving out your space in the existing community- that's both fun and also what made these mmo's good.

				Things are going to keep evolving engine wise, that's for sure.
				 
				As the tools become more and more advanced, it'll leave people to focus on the actual game design and game play.
				  
				The difference between a software engineer and game developer will, eventually, become: the software engineer develops the tools and the game developers use them. Things have progressed to a point with engines where you can start to build relatively complex games with no programming experience what-so-ever; those tools will keep evolving for all fields.  
				  
				And given that there are companies like Microsoft working on AI that writes code... if something like that becomes perfected.... software engineers may, someday, become an extinct species entirely, if you can just tell a program what you want something to do and it writes another program for you to do it. it's a long road between here and there, but that's where we are going.

						One of the nice things about the mainstream though is community support for assets, scripts, and people to ask when you run into problems. Sounds like LibGdx has that though, so that's pretty cool.
						
						In my professional work, when we're considering pulling in a dependency (closed or open source), one of the big things I look at when weighing libraries/solutions is the community around it.
						
						It's one of the big reasons I'm using LOVE for my side project, the Lua community is pretty great and LOVE has a very active and knowledgable community around it as well. Unity's great for what it's good for, but there's totally reasons to go with something else. In my case I've got a 2D game and I'm working with someone who is computer literate but not a coder. I want to hand off as much of the content generation as I can to him, but that'd require him to learn both Tiled and Unity or me to import his changes.
						
						With our current setup we've got a really easy workflow using just Tiled, so he didn't have to learn something as complex as Unity.

		Let me give you a place to start, I've mentioned it in other comments: SpatialOS. SpatialOS plugs right into Unity and Unreal, it's been highly recommended by a number of people I've talked to when I was looking for resources. But, it was a little bigger than I needed to handle for a tile based game.
		  
		Also, if you weren't against putting your game on someone else's platform.... HeroEngine is also a decent choice. That's where Star Wars KOTR and Elder Scrolls Online got started. A developer's seat is $99/year, and when you launch your game they do *everything* for you.... from handling accounts to instancing in exchange for 30% of your game's profit.
		  
		  
		Personally, I'm building my server from scratch because I want to learn on top of what I already know... and I can't do that using someone else's platform.

	Every online game has text chat between the players, so you won't be wasting time.  And the architecture of an MMORPG server is pretty similar to a chat server, so you'll be able to build on it for the rest of the game.

		Originally and long ago, it was a MUD I had written, I tried to implement it as a graphical game in the late 90s, but I never had the time to work on it back then because I had to do too much adulting things, plus, hosting was incredibly expensive so I was discouraged by the cost of even hosting a server for any kind of development purposes.
		  
		I have a fair bit of programming experience, but I'm not an expert, not even close. Mostly, I've done business applications for local business... and my own little programs for this or that. I made a lot of games when I was a kid>->teenager, but it was just things that I wanted to make just because... old arcade clones, adventure games, space strategy type games. More recently, I did do a lot of scripting though; which is, well, the same thing, I guess. :) I made a living scripting and animating adult content for several years.
		  
		What I'm working on now, is taking old ideas and rebuilding them anew on a little larger scale; so I took a bunch of libraries I had written over the years, and used them to build a framework. You can follow my dev blog here: http://www.patreon.com/lillybyte/posts (no Patreon only posts, I want to keep the whole dev process open).
		  
		I've dropped everything in my life to work full time on this project (and a few tiny ones along the way); because I've always wanted to. I don't recommend other people do that, it's not a good idea... but, it is for me. :)

			I have also dropped everything to work on my game. I quit my job last November.
			
			My game is kind of a traditional MMORPG. The two games I think are closest are EverQuest and Tibia. But I think a lot of decisions in modern MMORPGs are bad. I want my game to be hard, have a harsh penalty for death, no instances in PvP, etc. Basically I want an old-school, hard, social, addictive game. I think WoW is atrocious. And who knows what features I'll add in the future. Perhaps some kind of crafting or housing and stuff like that. But right now I'm focused on making a simple, traditional game but making the (in my mind) right decisions.
			
			Another thing worth mentioning is that I'm procedurally generating my world. I don't have time to make and editor and a world by hand. As such, quests and story is lacking, but I could easily just make a new world whenever I want, to keep things fresh.
			
			I have not done almost any graphics yet. I saw on your Patreon that you have used a lot of tools for that. I would like to have low-poly 3D graphics. But I have always thought I would try to get someone to cooperate with me on that once I'm reasonably sure I will be able to get the game done. But perhaps I could make my own graphics with the right tools :) I don't have much experience, but I did try a 2-week stint of Blender, and I was not hopeless. :)

				That sounds really neat... I'm, similarly, doing the same. I'm aiming for a niche audience. I don't want wide appeal, I want niche appeal. 
				  
				I'm also doing procedural generation; well, the world map is going to be a 2D tile map that I'll hand place, but the regions that those tiles open up to will be procedural generation based on the tile... so, if I put a forest, the underlying region will generated a forest, if it's a hilly area, it'll generate hills, etc. 
				  
				Let me tell you something that's going to be highly controversial.... if you're just looking to do low poly modeling without heavy texturing... pick yourself up a copy of Silo 2. You can often pick it up on sale on Steam, and I personally think it's one of the best dedicated modelers I've ever used next to Nvil.... but that's all it does, is modeling.

					You mentioned that you had done the networking part. I have basic networking to be able to try things out, but I will have to redo it later in in order to support more players. I was thinking of partitioning the world in a grid or something, so that only players that are close together gets messages about each other. And then hoping that would do it. :) How did you approach it? Do you have any tips or good articles?

						My world is broken into small, voxel regions; and right now, the server is self-contained and handles everything... When the server receives a message, what it will do is check which players are in the same region and then check the distance between player positions; it doesn't have to poll all the players, it only needs to poll players in the same region, which the region itself keeps an index of, that cuts down on the number of player checks for communication. So, if they're in the same region and within range of each other... the players can chat to each other. But, there will be no global chat, because I want the world to have a 'feeling' of isolation, despite being in a multiplayer world. If I were to miraculously start getting hundreds and hundreds of players... then I would start carving up the server into pieces and passing off data to those servers for chat to lighten any load... but, if you're not getting a lot of players... it's not even a worry. If you don't want to split your world up into grids (which could get complicated if people were on the opposite border of grids)... just compare their distances... and decide which players can see it based on that distance.

							Yeah, that was what I was thinking. Do do something like your regions, I guess. I think I'll be able to do it once I need to. :)
							
							By the way, you talking about the chat thing brought back some memories.
							
							A few years ago I used to play EQ Emulator servers, that were all PvP and about 100 people were moving between different servers. I mean, 100 people were the whole scene. And they were all joining the new servers that came online. Having a world-wide chat on such a server was pretty funny, and it would have felt lonely if not, I think. People were always announcing their victories over other players and trash talking.
							
							Found some old forum posts. This was going on ALL THE TIME. As soon as someone killed anyone it was screenshot and forum time. Too bad the images don't remain.

							One guy even made videos of his kills, like this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo1hmS4H5Rk
							
							The thing about those EverQuest Emulator servers was that everybody knew everybody, and killing someone was considered kind of a big deal because of the community and because people cared in general because of the death penalty. This is kind of what I want in my game. :) If you die in WoW it's like "Whatever, in 30 seconds I'm back to doing whatever I was doing."

					If a game is mostly privately instanced, there's nothing massively multiplayer about it.  If you can't have chance encounters with random players in a shared gaming experience, you aren't playing an MMO.  It might be an MO with a massive number of players (like GW1, PoE, et al.), but that's a pretty stark difference.  Having shared town instances definitely muddies the water, which I'm sure is intentional, as it makes the game feel more like a shared experience than it actually is.

	This discussion often ends with people arguing about what should be considered "massive". 100? 1000? 1million players?

	Fact is: no one cares. If you're so picky about it just make an MORPG instead.

	Another example I wanna add to this is Meadow from MightAndDelight. It's a online multiplayer game, where each of the 4 servers hosts 9 instances. each instance can hold 50 players. It might not be massive but it's still big enough. Do you know how the networking works? It's using 2 HTTP channels. 1 Downstream and HTTP-Requests for upstream. Also the engine is Unity.

		Depending on the amount of data your MMORPG has to track, hundreds isn't an issue. 
		  
		If you have intensive gameplay, then your server has to start handing off players to instances to balance data... and if players across those instances have to see each other then the servers have to be able to negotiate what can be seen across the border with those instances.
		  
		However, if your game is simpler and not high energy... then you can have a single server handling a thousand or two players in a single server.

		The thing is though, if your game actually managed to attract say 1000 concurrent players you should have plenty of cash to hire out and expand your team for future projects/expansions. People under estimate how much a smaller scale mmo can make. Attracting that size of player base means you've already achieved a pretty damn good success and with proper monitization you should be earning a few hundred thousand a year for your effort.  
		
		Designing a server that can handle 500-1500 concurrent players is quite simple to do and should be within the capability of anyone with a few years of programming experience. It's when you're dealing with tens of thousands of concurrent players things get really messy.

				Easy is not the word I would use but it's far from the black magic people make it out to be. It doesn't matter much if a map, shard or instance can only handle a hundred players as long as your game is designed with that in mind

			It's like I said, when you say MMORPG people have this pavlovian response "World of Warcraft". The first MMORPG was nothing like World of Warcraft, and only handled 50 players. :D
			 
			I mean, once I streamlined map streaming... the bots I slammed into my server across a few cloud servers says a few hundred players can be handled easily. For the amount of data that will be sent back and forth.... 500-1500 isn't out of reach.

	Couldnt agree more. I have built a simple mobile ut like shooter in 4 months. Right now I am making a game which could be described as an fps mmorpg mix and I am already pretty far. The engines are so good today that online games are not much harder to do than offline. I know that it will take me at least a year to finish a beta version but I know I can do it.

	Actually, if you give a small indie dev or team 2-3 years they should  be able to create a great game. The reason why indies fail at large project is first the lack of knowledge or second the lack of motivation. First create a multiplayer pong and then you should be able to create a worthwhile online game, given that you stay motivated for a long time.

		The other thing is; people are generally not aware of the options. 
		  
		SpatialOS is a thing; it's designed for small, indie teams to maintain massive worlds with lots of players... and it plugs right into Unreal and Unity.
		  
		HeroEngine is also a thing; Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic used it, Elder Scrolls Online ran on it before they bought a license for the source code. A developer seat is $99/year... which gives you a whole back end to build any type of MMORPG you want on... and when you go live, they handle everything for a cut in profit. You don't even need to look at server code or know how to do much of anything in the regards of a backend with HeroEngine.
		  
		Things like this simplify the creation of very large worlds.

			Last time I checked Hero Engine, it had some severe limitations, for example limiting a level to 256x256 meters only, and masking level borders with props in order to make the world seem seamless because otherwise there would be a problem in level transition.
			
			SpatialOS connects Unity/Unreal instances together. In my opinion, it can handle as many players per level as these engines allow, which might be fairly small for MMORPGs.
