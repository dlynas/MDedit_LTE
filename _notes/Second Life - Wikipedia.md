_**Second Life**_ is an online multimedia platform that allows people to create an [avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing) "Avatar (computing)") for themselves and then interact with other users and user-created content within a multi-user online [virtual world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world "Virtual world"). Developed and owned by the [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco "San Francisco")–based firm [Linden Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linden_Lab "Linden Lab") and launched on June 23, 2003, it saw rapid growth for some years and in 2013 it had approximately one million regular users.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Growth eventually stabilized, and by the end of 2017 the active user count had declined to "between 800,000 and 900,000".<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> In many ways, _Second Life_ is similar to [massively multiplayer online role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game "Massively multiplayer online role-playing game"); nevertheless, Linden Lab is emphatic that their creation is not a game: "There is no manufactured conflict, no set objective."<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

The virtual world can be accessed freely via Linden Lab's own [client software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing) "Client (computing)") or via alternative third-party viewers.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> _Second Life_ users, also called 'residents', create virtual representations of themselves, called _[avatars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing) "Avatar (computing)")_, and are able to interact with places, objects and other avatars. They can explore the world (known as the grid), meet other residents, socialize, participate in both individual and group activities, build, create, shop, and trade [virtual property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_goods "Virtual goods") and services with one another.

The platform principally features 3D-based user-generated content. _Second Life_ also has its own virtual currency, the Linden Dollar (L$), which is exchangeable with real world currency.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> _Second Life_ is intended for people ages 16 and over, with the exception of 13–15-year-old users, who are restricted to the _Second Life_ region of a sponsoring institution (e.g., a school).<sup id="cite_ref-secondlife.com_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-secondlife.com-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Teens_in_Second_Life_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Teens_in_Second_Life-14">[14]</a></sup>

[Philip Rosedale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Rosedale "Philip Rosedale"), founder of _Second Life_

[Philip Rosedale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Rosedale "Philip Rosedale") formed Linden Lab in 1999<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> with the intention of developing computer hardware to allow people to become immersed in a virtual world. In its earliest form, the company struggled to produce a commercial version of the hardware, known as "The Rig", which in prototype form was seen as a clunky steel contraption with computer monitors worn on shoulders.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> That vision changed into the software application Linden World, in which people participated in task-based games and socializing in a three-dimensional online environment.<sup id="cite_ref-lindenlab-pressrelease-20020211_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lindenlab-pressrelease-20020211-17">[17]</a></sup> That effort eventually transformed into the better-known, user-centered _Second Life_.<sup id="cite_ref-lindenlab-pressrelease-20021030_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lindenlab-pressrelease-20021030-18">[18]</a></sup> Although he was familiar with the [metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse "Metaverse") of [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson "Neal Stephenson")'s novel _[Snow Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash "Snow Crash")_, Rosedale has said that his vision of virtual worlds predates that book, and that he conducted early virtual world experiments during his college years at the [University of California, San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego "University of California, San Diego"), where he studied physics.<sup id="cite_ref-newyorktimes-philip-rosedale-answers-your-second-life-questions_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-newyorktimes-philip-rosedale-answers-your-second-life-questions-19">[19]</a></sup>

_Second Life_ began to receive significant media attention in 2005 and 2006, including a cover story in _[BusinessWeek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusinessWeek "BusinessWeek")_ magazine featuring the virtual world and _Second Life_ avatar [Anshe Chung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshe_Chung "Anshe Chung").<sup id="cite_ref-businessweekmag-my-virtual-life_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-businessweekmag-my-virtual-life-20">[20]</a></sup> By that time, Anshe Chung had become _Second Life_'s poster child and symbol for the economic opportunities that the virtual world offers to its residents. At the same time, the service saw a period of exponential growth of its user base.

One of the principal developers, [Cory Ondrejka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Ondrejka "Cory Ondrejka"), was forced to resign as [chief technology officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer "Chief technology officer") in December 2007, with Rosedale citing irreconcilable differences in the way the company was run.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Nevertheless, the platform continued to grow rapidly, and by January 2008, residents spent a total of 28,274,505 hours "inworld" and on average 38,000 residents were logged in at any moment. The maximum concurrency (number of avatars inworld) recorded was set at 88,200 in the first quarter of 2009.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

Headquarters of [Linden Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linden_Lab "Linden Lab"), creator of _Second Life_

_Second Life_ was honored at the [Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_%26_Engineering_Emmy_Award "Technology & Engineering Emmy Award") for advancing the development of online sites with user-generated content in 2008, adding to the media attention. Rosedale accepted the award,<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> although he had announced plans to step down from his position as Linden Lab CEO and to become chairman of [Linden Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linden_Lab "Linden Lab")'s board of directors instead in March 2008 .<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Rosedale announced [Mark Kingdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_D._Kingdon "Mark D. Kingdon") as the new CEO effective May 15, 2008.<sup id="cite_ref-InformationWeek-second-life-gets-new-CEO_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-InformationWeek-second-life-gets-new-CEO-25">[25]</a></sup> In 2010, Kingdon was replaced by Rosedale, who took over as interim CEO. After four months, Rosedale abruptly stepped down from the Interim CEO position. It was announced in October 2010 that Bob Komin, Linden Lab's chief financial officer and chief operating officer, would take over the CEO job for the immediate future.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

With the platform's failure to continue its high rate of growth after 2009, Linden Lab announced layoffs of 30% of its workforce in 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Some 21.3 million accounts were registered by this point, although the company did not make public any statistics regarding actual long-term consistent usage and numbers of dormant accounts.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

Despite speculation as to the actual size of the user base, _Second Life_ continued as a commercial success. In 2015, _Second Life_ users cashed out approximately $60,000,000 (60 million US dollars) and _Second Life_ had an estimated GDP of $500,000,000 (500 million US dollars), higher than some small countries.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

Recognizing improvements in computing power and particularly in computer graphics, [Linden Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linden_Lab "Linden Lab") began work on a successor to _Second Life_, a VR experience called _[Sansar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sansar_(video_game) "Sansar (video game)")_, launching a public beta in July 2017. Uptake was low and Linden Lab halted development in 2020 to focus their attention fully on _Second Life_. The rights to _Sansar_'s assets were sold to Wookey Search Technologies, who are expected to continue development on the title without Linden Lab.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> _Second Life_, the usage of which peaked in the first decade of the 21st century, has been cited as the first example of the [metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse "Metaverse"),<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> a concept which has been taken up by other major corporations such as [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook "Facebook") in 2021. As a notable precursor (which retains a small and loyal following), it provides several examples of virtual reality social issues and lessons learned.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

## Classification\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Classification")\]

During a 2001 meeting with investors, Rosedale noticed that the participants were particularly responsive to the collaborative, creative potential of _Second Life_. As a result, the initial objective-driven, gaming focus of _Second Life_ was shifted to a more user-created, community-driven experience.<sup id="cite_ref-youtube-origin-of-second-life-and-its-relations-to-real-life_33-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-youtube-origin-of-second-life-and-its-relations-to-real-life-33">[33]</a></sup>

_Second Life_'s status as a [virtual world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world "Virtual world"), a computer game, or a [talker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talker "Talker"), is frequently debated.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch"><span title="The material near this tag possibly uses too-vague attribution or weasel words. (June 2013)">who?</span></a></i>]</sup> Unlike traditional computer games, _Second Life_ does not have a designated objective, nor traditional game play mechanics or rules. It can also be argued that _Second Life_ is a multi-user virtual world, because its virtual world facilitates interaction between multiple users. As it does not have any stipulated goals, it is irrelevant to talk about winning or losing in relation to _Second Life_. Likewise, unlike a traditional talker<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vagueness" title="Wikipedia:Vagueness"><span title="This information is too vague. (May 2015)">vague</span></a></i>]</sup>, _Second Life_ contains an extensive world that can be explored and interacted with, and it can be used purely as a creative tool set if the user so chooses. In March 2006, while speaking at Google TechTalks,<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> Rosedale said: "So, we don't see this as a game. We see it as a platform."

_Second Life_ used to offer two main grids: one for adults (18+) and one for teens. In August 2010, Linden Lab closed the teen grid due to operating costs. Since then, users 16 and over can sign up for a free account.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> Other limited accounts are available for educators who use _Second Life_ with younger students.

There are three activity-based classifications, called "Ratings", for sims in _Second Life_:

1.  General (formerly "PG"—no extreme [violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence "Violence") or [nudity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity "Nudity"))
2.  Moderate (formerly "Mature"—some violence, [swearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swearing "Swearing"), adult situations, some nudity)
3.  Adult (may contain overt [sexual activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_activity "Sexual activity"), [nudity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity "Nudity"), and [violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence "Violence"))

## Residents and avatars\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Residents and avatars")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/Second_Life_11th_Birthday_Live_Drax_Files_Radio_Hour.jpg/220px-Second_Life_11th_Birthday_Live_Drax_Files_Radio_Hour.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Second_Life_11th_Birthday_Live_Drax_Files_Radio_Hour.jpg)

Several avatars together

There is no charge for creating a _Second Life_ account or for making use of the world for any period of time. Linden Lab reserves the right to charge for the creation of large numbers of multiple accounts for a single person (5 per household, 2 per 24 hours)<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> but at present does not do so. A Premium membership (US$11.99 monthly, US$32.97 quarterly, or US$99 annually) extends access to an increased level of technical support, and also pays an automatic stipend of L$300/week into the member's avatar account, and after 45 days that resident will receive a L$700 bonus, making it L$1,000 for that week. This amount has decreased since the original stipend of L$500, which is still paid to older accounts. Certain accounts created during an earlier period may receive L$400. This stipend, if changed into USD, means that the actual cost for the benefit of extended tech support for an annual payment of US$72 is only about US$14, depending on the currency exchange rates. However, the vast majority of casual users of _Second Life_ do not upgrade beyond the free "basic" account.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Avatars may take any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a combination thereof) or residents may choose to resemble themselves as they are in real life.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> They may choose even more abstract forms, given that almost every aspect of an avatar is fully customizable. _Second Life_ culture consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost everything else in Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person's multiple accounts are referred to as _[alts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_character "Alternate character")_).<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/SL_Bicycles.jpg/220px-SL_Bicycles.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SL_Bicycles.jpg)

Riding bicycles is one of the forms of transportation in _Second Life_.

Avatars can travel via walking, running, vehicular access, flying, or teleportation. Because _Second Life_ is such a vast virtual world, teleportation is used when avatars wish to travel instantly and efficiently. Once they reach their destination, they may travel in more conventional means at various speeds.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Avatars can communicate via local chat, group chat, global instant messaging (known as IM), and voice (public, private and group). Chatting is used for localized public conversations between two or more avatars, and is visible to any avatar within a given distance. IMs are used for private conversations, either between two avatars, or among the members of a group, or even between objects and avatars. Unlike chatting, IM communication does not depend on the participants being within a certain distance of each other. As of version 1.18.1.2 (2007-Aug-02), voice chat, both local and IM, was also available. Instant messages may optionally be sent to a Resident's email when the Resident is logged off, although message length is limited to 4096 bytes.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

Identities in _Second Life_ can relate to the users' personality or creating their own character. It is based on their decisions on how to express themselves. Most avatars are human, but they can choose to be vampires or animals. Sometimes, what they choose does not relate to their offline selves.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>

In _Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human_, anthropologist [Tom Boellstorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Boellstorff "Tom Boellstorff") notes that the interface of _Second Life_ is designed with the purpose of disconnecting a player's virtual identity from their physical identity in mind.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_40-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-:0-40">[40]</a></sup> As of 2015 _Second Life_ has made it possible to display one's legal name in the player's profile or as their screen name, but when Boellstorff first published the book in 2008 users were required to select a last name from a pre-determined list of options. Boellstorff describes this mentality as being in direct contrast to the one held by other mainstream social media websites, where anonymity is shunned and users are encouraged to make the link between their online and physical presence clear.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

## Content\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Content")\]

Many different clothes created by users can be purchased in _Second Life_.

The ability to create content and shape the _Second Life_ world is one of the key features that separate this from online games. Built into the software is a [3D modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling "3D modeling") tool based on simple geometric shapes that allows residents to build virtual objects. There is also a [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming "Procedural programming") scripting language, Linden Scripting Language, which can be used to add interactivity to objects. Sculpted prims ("sculpties"), [3D mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh "Polygon mesh"), textures for clothing or other objects, animations, and gestures can be created using external software and imported. The _Second Life_ terms of service provide that users retain copyright for any content they create, and the server and client provide simple [digital rights management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management "Digital rights management") (DRM) functions.<sup id="cite_ref-secondlife.com_13-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-secondlife.com-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-lawvibe_41-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lawvibe-41">[41]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-SecureVend_42-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-SecureVend-42">[42]</a></sup> However, Linden Lab changed their terms of service in August 2013 to be able to use user-generated content for any purpose.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> The new terms of service prevent users from using textures from third-party texture services, as some of them pointed out explicitly.<sup id="cite_ref-Renderosity_Bans_Its_Products_from_Second_Life_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Renderosity_Bans_Its_Products_from_Second_Life-44">[44]</a></sup>

[User-generated content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content "User-generated content") in the virtual world _Second Life_

_Second Life_ has an internal economy and closed-loop virtual token called the "[Linden dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Second_Life "Economy of Second Life") (L$)". L$ can be used to buy, sell, rent or trade land or goods and services with other users. The "Linden Dollar" is a closed-loop virtual token for use only within the Second Life platform. Linden Dollars have no monetary value and are not redeemable for monetary value from Linden Lab. A resident with a surplus of Linden Dollars earned via a Second Life business or experiential play can request to refund their Linden Dollar surplus to PayPal. Linden Lab reports that the _Second Life_ economy generated US$3,596,674 in economic activity during the month of September 2005,<sup id="cite_ref-technologyreviewdotcom_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-technologyreviewdotcom-45">[45]</a></sup> and in September 2006 _Second Life_ was reported to have a GDP of $64 million.<sup id="cite_ref-popscidotcom-your-2ndlife-is-ready_46-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-popscidotcom-your-2ndlife-is-ready-46">[46]</a></sup> In 2009, the total size of the _Second Life_ economy grew 65% to US$567 million, about 25% of the entire U.S. virtual goods market. Gross resident earnings are US$55 million in 2009 – 11% growth over 2008.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> In 2013, Linden Lab released an info graphic that showed that over 10 years $3.2 billion in transactions for virtual goods had exchanged between _Second Life_ residents, with an average of 1.2 million daily transactions.<sup id="cite_ref-lindenlab.com_48-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lindenlab.com-48">[48]</a></sup>

There is a high level of entrepreneurial activity in _Second Life_. Residents of _Second Life_ are able to create virtual objects and other content. _Second Life_ is unique in that users retain all the rights to their content which means they can use _Second Life_ to distribute and sell their creations, with 2.1 million items listed on its online marketplace.<sup id="cite_ref-lindenlab.com_48-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lindenlab.com-48">[48]</a></sup> At its height circa 2006, hundreds of thousands of dollars were changing hands daily as residents created and sold a wide variety of virtual commodities. _Second Life_ also quickly became profitable due to the selling and renting of virtual real estate. 2006 also saw _Second Life_'s first real-world millionaire; Ailin Graef, better known as [Anshe Chung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshe_Chung "Anshe Chung") (her avatar), converted an initial investment of US$9.95 into over one million dollars over the course of two and a half years. She built her fortune primarily by buying, selling, and renting virtual real estate.<sup id="cite_ref-nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2009/03/million.html_49-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2009/03/million.html-49">[49]</a></sup>

Major tech corporations have tried to use _Second Life_ to market products or services to _Second Life_'s tech-savvy audience. IBM, for example, purchased 12 islands within _Second Life_ for virtual training and simulations of key business processes, but has since moved on to other platforms due to maintenance costs.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> Others, like musicians, podcasters, and news organizations (including [CNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNET "CNET"), [Reuters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters "Reuters"), [NPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR "NPR")'s _[The Infinite Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Mind "The Infinite Mind")_, and the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC")), have all had a presence within _Second Life_.<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup>

Virtual goods include buildings, vehicles, devices of all kinds, animations, clothing, skin, hair, jewelry, [flora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora "Flora") and [fauna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna "Fauna"), and works of art. Services include business management, entertainment, and custom content creation (which can be broken up into the following six categories: building, texturing, scripting, animating, art direction, and the position of producer/project funder). L$ can be purchased using US dollars and other local currencies on the LindeX exchange provided by Linden Lab. Customer USD wallets obtained from Linden Dollar sales on the Lindex are most commonly used to pay _Second Life_'s own subscription and tier fees; only a relatively small number of users earn enough profit to request a refund to PayPal. According to figures published by Linden Lab, about 64,000 users made a profit in _Second Life_ in February 2009, of whom 38,524 made less than US$10, while 233 made more than US$5000.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> Profits are derived from selling virtual goods, renting land, and a broad range of services.

_Second Life_ comprises the _viewer_ (also known as the _client_) executing on the user's personal computer, and several thousand servers operated by Linden Lab.

### Client\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Client")\]

Linden Lab provides official viewers for the operating systems [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows "Windows"), [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS "MacOS"), and most distributions of [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") where the more known [ChromeOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromeOS "ChromeOS") has been excluded so far. The viewer renders 3D graphics using [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL "OpenGL") technology. The viewer source code was released under the GPL in 2007<sup id="cite_ref-lindenlabdotcom-press-release-01-08-07_54-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lindenlabdotcom-press-release-01-08-07-54">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-lindenblog-embracing-the-inevitable_55-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lindenblog-embracing-the-inevitable-55">[55]</a></sup> and moved to the LGPL in 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-lindenblog-what-does-the-lgpl-mean-for-secondlife-viewers_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lindenblog-what-does-the-lgpl-mean-for-secondlife-viewers-56">[56]</a></sup>

There are now several mature third-party viewer projects, the most popular being Firestorm, that contain features not available in the Linden Lab 'Official' client, target other platforms or cater to specialist & accessibility needs.<sup id="cite_ref-third-party-viewer-directory_57-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-third-party-viewer-directory-57">[57]</a></sup> The main focus of third party development is exploring new ideas and working with Linden Lab to deliver new functionality.<sup id="cite_ref-new-open-source-project-to-improve-graphics-rendering_58-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-new-open-source-project-to-improve-graphics-rendering-58">[58]</a></sup>

An independent project, libopenmetaverse,<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> offers a function library for interacting with _Second Life_ servers. libopenmetaverse has been used to create non-graphic third party viewers.

There are several _Alternate Viewers_ published by Linden Lab used for software testing by volunteers for early access to upcoming projects.<sup id="cite_ref-lindenwiki-alternate-viewers_60-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lindenwiki-alternate-viewers-60">[60]</a></sup> Some of these clients only function on the "beta grid" consisting of a limited number of regions running various releases of unstable test server code.

### Server\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Server")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Winter_landscape_in_Second_Life.png/220px-Winter_landscape_in_Second_Life.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Winter_landscape_in_Second_Life.png)

Each full region (an area of 256×256 meters) in the _Second Life_ "grid" runs on a single dedicated core of a multi-core server. Homestead regions share 3 regions per core and Openspace Regions share 4 regions per core, running proprietary software on [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian "Debian") [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux"). These servers run scripts in the region, as well as providing communication between avatars and objects present in the region.

Every item in the _Second Life_ universe is referred to as an _asset_. This includes the shapes of basic 3D polygon objects formally known as _Primitive Mesh_ (commonly known as _primitives_ or _prims_ for short), the digital images referred to as _textures_ that decorate primitives, digitized audio clips, avatar shape and appearance, avatar skin textures, LSL scripts, information written on notecards, and so on. Each asset is referenced with a universally unique identifier or _[UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID "UUID")_.<sup id="cite_ref-sl-wiki-uuid_61-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-sl-wiki-uuid-61">[61]</a></sup>

Assets are stored on [Isilon Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isilon_Systems "Isilon Systems") storage clusters,<sup id="cite_ref-isilon_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-isilon-62">[62]</a></sup> comprising all data that has ever been created by anyone who has been in the _Second Life_ world. Infrequently used assets are offloaded to [S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3 "Amazon S3") bulk storage.<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> As of December 2007, the total storage was estimated to consume 100 [terabytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabyte "Terabyte") of server capacity.<sup id="cite_ref-capacity_64-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-capacity-64">[64]</a></sup> The asset servers function independently of the region simulators, though the region simulators act as a proxy for the client, request object data from the asset servers when a new object loads into the simulator.<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> Region simulators areas are commonly known as _sims_ by residents.

Each server instance runs a physics simulation to manage the collisions and interactions of all objects in that region. Objects can be nonphysical and non-moving, or actively physical and movable. Complex shapes may be linked together in groups of up to 256 separate primitives. Additionally, each player's avatar is treated as a physical object so that it may interact with physical objects in the world. As of 9 July 2014, _Second Life_ simulators use the _[Havok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havok_(software) "Havok (software)") 2011.2_ physics engine for all in-world dynamics.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> This engine is capable of simulating thousands of physical objects at once.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>

Linden Lab pursues the use of [open standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard "Open standard") technologies, and uses [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software") and [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software "Open source software") such as [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server "Apache HTTP Server"), [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL "MySQL"), [Squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_(software) "Squid (software)") and [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux").<sup id="cite_ref-informationweek-open-doors-to-innovation_68-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-informationweek-open-doors-to-innovation-68">[68]</a></sup> The plan is to move everything to open standards by [standardizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization "Standardization") the _Second Life_ protocol. [Cory Ondrejka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Ondrejka "Cory Ondrejka"), former CTO<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> of _Second Life_, stated in 2006 that a while after everything has been standardized, both the client and the server will be released as free and open source software.<sup id="cite_ref-lugradio-episode-42_70-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lugradio-episode-42-70">[70]</a></sup>

### OpenSimulator\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: OpenSimulator")\]

In January 2007, OpenSimulator was founded as an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software") simulator project. The aim of this project is to develop a full open-source server software for _Second Life_ clients. OpenSIM is [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD "BSD") Licensed and it is written in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) "C Sharp (programming language)") and can run under [Mono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software) "Mono (software)") environment. From 2008, alternative grids began to emerge and many of these allow cross visits from other grids through the hypergrid protocol<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> using OpenSimulator.

The Egyptian-owned news website [Islam Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_Online "Islam Online") has purchased land in _Second Life_ to allow [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims") and non-Muslims alike to perform the ritual of [Hajj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj "Hajj") in virtual reality form, obtaining experience before actually making the pilgrimage to [Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca "Mecca") in person.<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup>

_Second Life_ also offers several groups that cater to the needs and interests of [humanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanist "Humanist"), [atheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist "Atheist"), [agnostics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic "Agnostic"), and [freethinkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought "Freethought"). One of the most active groups is SL Humanism which has been holding weekly discussion meetings inside _Second Life_ every Sunday since 2006.<sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup>

### Relationships\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Relationships")\]

[Romantic relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_relationship "Romantic relationship") are common in _Second Life_, including some couples who have married online.<sup id="cite_ref-100"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> The social engagement offered by the online environment helps those who might be socially isolated. In addition, [sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex "Sex") is often encountered.<sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup> However, to access the adult sections requires age verification.<sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup> There are also large [BDSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM "BDSM") and [Gorean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorean "Gorean") communities.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup>

_Second Life_ relationships have been taken from virtual online relationships into personal, real-world relationships. Booperkit Moseley and Shukran Fahid were possibly the first couple to meet in _Second Life_ and then marry in real life. Booperkit travelled to the United States to meet Shukran and he returned to England with her after one week. They married in 2006, had twin boys in 2009, and are still married. Some couples meet online, form friendships, and eventually move to finding one another in the real world.<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup> Some even have their weddings on _Second Life_, as well as in a real-world setting.<sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup>

Relationships in virtual worlds have an added dimension compared to other [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media "Social media"), because avatars give a feeling of proximity making the voyeur experience more intense than simply a textual encounter. The complexities of those encounters depend on the engagement levels of the people behind the avatars, whether they are engaging disassociatively (entertainment only), immersively (as if the avatar was them), or augmentatively (meaning they engage for a real-life purpose).<sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup>

### Science\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Science")\]

_Second Life_ is used for scientific research, collaboration, and data visualization.<sup id="cite_ref-108"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup> Examples include [SciLands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SciLands "SciLands"), American Chemical Society's ACS Island, Genome, Virginia Tech's SLATE, and Nature Publishing Group's Elucian Islands Village.

### \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Social network")\]

_Second Life_ can be a real-time, immersive social space for people including those with physical or mental disabilities that impair their lives, who often find comfort and security interacting through anonymous avatars. (Some academics believe using _Second Life_ might even help improve motor ability for people with [Parkinson's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease").).<sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup>

An example of how _Second Life_ has been used by disabled people is [Wheelies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelies "Wheelies"), the widely publicised disability-themed virtual nightclub founded by [Simon Stevens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_James_Stevens "Simon James Stevens").

### Music streams\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Music streams")\]

[Shoutcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoutcast "Shoutcast") and [Icecast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icecast "Icecast") radio stations can be streamed into a land parcel in _Second Life_. The streaming codec is MP3, as AAC and Vorbis are not currently supported. There are [internet radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_radio "Internet radio") providers that offer these services or select from a list. At the time of this writing, media on a prim (MOAP) is not a reliable enough way of displaying media and such, sites listed work best with Parcel Media or Parcel Audio.

The controversial campus of [Woodbury University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_University "Woodbury University")'s School of Media, Culture and Design, which was deleted in 2010 by [Linden Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linden_Lab "Linden Lab")

Linden Lab has twice, in 2007 and 2010, banned a California educational institution, [Woodbury University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_University "Woodbury University"), from having a representation within _Second Life_. On April 20, 2010, four simulators belonging to the university were deleted and the accounts of several students and professors terminated, according to _[The Chronicle of Higher Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicle_of_Higher_Education "The Chronicle of Higher Education")_. Edward Clift, dean of the School of Media, Culture and Design at Woodbury University, told _The Chronicle of Higher Education_ that their campus "was a living, breathing campus in _Second Life_", including educational spaces designed mostly by students, such as a mock representation of the former [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") and a replica of the [Berlin Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall "Berlin Wall"). According to Clift, the virtual campus did not "conform to what Linden Lab wanted a campus to be".<sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Jeff_Young_114-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Jeff_Young-114">[114]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup>

### _The Alphaville Herald_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: The Alphaville Herald")\]

In 2004, the newspaper _[The Alphaville Herald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alphaville_Herald "The Alphaville Herald")_, founded and edited by the philosopher [Peter Ludlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ludlow "Peter Ludlow"), migrated to _Second Life_, and in the following years the newspaper played a prominent role in reporting on _Second Life_ and in the public discussion of the game.<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup> The newspaper, which was known as _The Second Life Herald_ from 2004 to 2009, was later edited by the Internet pioneer [Mark P. McCahill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_P._McCahill "Mark P. McCahill").

### 2007 "Virtual Riot"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: 2007 "Virtual Riot"")\]

In January 2007, a "virtual riot" erupted between members of the [French National Front (FN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_National_(France) "Front National (France)") who had established a virtual HQ on _Second Life_, and "anti-racism" activists, including [Second Life Left Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Businesses_and_organizations_in_Second_Life "Businesses and organizations in Second Life"), a socialist and anti-capitalist user-group.<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-120"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup> Since then, several small Internet-based organizations have claimed some responsibility for instigating the riots.<sup id="cite_ref-122"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup>

### Marketing\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Marketing")\]

Corporate marketers, especially during the height of _Second Life_ in the cultural zeitgeist of 2005–2010, have been accused of being overly credulous of the actual reach and influence of _Second Life_. Journalists have theorized this might be partially due to blithely accepting total account statistics rather than harder-to-discern active player counts. Reasons for account "inflation" can include in-world systems which encourage the creation of bogus extra accounts such as "traffic bots" which simply remain stationary in a store, causing the system to rank the store as popular because there are people there, as well as simply idle and long inactive accounts.<sup id="cite_ref-123"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-124"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup> One article in _Wired_ featured a marketer for Coca-Cola who found _Second Life_ to be essentially deserted when personally inspecting it, yet still funded a marketing campaign there anyway from fear of missing out.<sup id="cite_ref-125"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-126"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup>

### Griefing and denial of service attacks\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Griefing and denial of service attacks")\]

_Second Life_ has been attacked several times by groups of residents abusing the creation tools to create objects that harass other users or damage the system. This included [grey goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo "Grey goo") objects which infinitely reproduce, eventually overwhelming the servers;<sup id="cite_ref-127"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup> _orbiters_ which throw an avatar so far upwards they cannot get back down in a reasonable timeframe without teleporting; _cages_ which surround avatars, preventing them from moving, and similar tools. Although combat between users is sanctioned in certain areas of the world, these objects have been used to cause disruption in all areas. Attacks on the grid itself, such as Grey Goo, are strictly forbidden anywhere on the grid. It was possible to perpetrate [denial-of-service attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "Denial-of-service attack") (DoS) on other users simply by scripting objects that spew screen filling characters from anywhere on the grid to another avatar's location, thereby disabling a clear view to the virtual world. Bugs in the client and server software were also exploited by griefers to kick users, crash servers, and revert content before being patched out.<sup id="cite_ref-128"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>

### The Emerald client and in-world logging scripts\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: The Emerald client and in-world logging scripts")\]

The Emerald client was developed by a group of users based on Snowglobe, an opensource fork of the _Second Life_ client. Several groups alleged that the Emerald viewer contained [Trojan code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing) "Trojan horse (computing)") which tracked user details and demographics in a way that the developers could later recover. One of these groups was banned from _Second Life_ by Linden Lab after publishing their discovery.<sup id="cite_ref-brokentoys.org_129-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-brokentoys.org-129">[129]</a></sup> Shortly afterward, a member of the Emerald team was accused of a [DDOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDOS "DDOS") attack against another website. In response, Linden Lab revoked Emerald's third-party viewer approval and permanently banned several of Emerald's developers.<sup id="cite_ref-130"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup> Due to what happened with Emerald, Linden Lab instituted a new third-party viewer policy.<sup id="cite_ref-131"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-132"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup>

The support staff and one of the developers of the Emerald project, who was not banned, left to work on a new viewer project, Phoenix (using some of the Emerald codebase, but without [Off-the-Record Messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging "Off-the-Record Messaging") nor any potentially malicious code).<sup id="cite_ref-133"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-133">[133]</a></sup> The Phoenix team are now the developers behind Firestorm Viewer, a fork of _Second Life'_s "viewer 2.0" open source client.<sup id="cite_ref-134"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-134">[134]</a></sup>

## Criticism and controversy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Criticism and controversy")\]

_Second Life_ has seen a number of controversies. Issues range from the technical ([budgeting of server resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_(Second_Life)#Budgeting_of_server_resources "Real estate (Second Life)")), to moral pornography, to legal ([legal position of the Linden Dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Second_Life#Legal_position_of_the_Linden_Dollar "Economy of Second Life"), _[Bragg v. Linden Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_v._Linden_Lab "Bragg v. Linden Lab")_). Security issues have also been a concern.

### Regulation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Regulation")\]

In the past, large portions of the _Second Life_ economy consisted of businesses that are regulated or banned. Changes to _Second Life_'s terms of service in this regard have largely had the purpose of bringing activity within _Second Life_ into compliance with various international laws, even though the person running the business may be in full compliance with the law in their own country.

On July 26, 2007, Linden Lab announced a ban on in-world gambling due to federal and state regulations on Internet gambling that could affect Linden Lab if it was permitted to continue. The ban was immediately met with in-world protests.<sup id="cite_ref-libsl-sl-gambling-banned_135-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-libsl-sl-gambling-banned-135">[135]</a></sup>

In August 2007, a $750,000 in-world Linden Dollar bank or [Ponzi scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme "Ponzi scheme") called [Ginko Financial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginko_Financial "Ginko Financial") collapsed due to a [bank run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run "Bank run") triggered by Linden Lab's ban on gambling.<sup id="cite_ref-136"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-136">[136]</a></sup> The aftershocks of this collapse caused severe liquidity problems for other virtual "Linden Dollar banks", which critics had long asserted were scams. On Tuesday, January 8, 2008, Linden Lab announced the upcoming prohibition of payment of fixed interest on cash deposits in unregulated banking activities in-world.<sup id="cite_ref-libsl-sl-banks-banned_137-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-libsl-sl-banks-banned-137">[137]</a></sup> All banks without real-world charters closed or converted to virtual joint stock companies by January 22, 2008.<sup id="cite_ref-138"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-138">[138]</a></sup> After the ban, a few companies continue to offer non-interest bearing deposit accounts to residents, such as the [e-commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce "E-commerce") site XStreet, which had already adopted a zero-interest policy 3 months before the Linden Lab interest ban.

### Technical issues\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Technical issues")\]

Kayaking through the virtual world

_Second Life_ has suffered from difficulties related to system instability. These include increased system latency, and intermittent client crashes. However, some faults are caused by the system's use of an "asset server" cluster, on which the actual data governing objects is stored separately from the areas of the world and the avatars that use those objects. The communication between the main servers and the asset cluster appears to constitute a [bottleneck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottleneck_(engineering) "Bottleneck (engineering)") which frequently causes problems.<sup id="cite_ref-139"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-139">[139]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-140"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-140">[140]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-141"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-141">[141]</a></sup> Typically, when asset server downtime is announced, users are advised not to build, manipulate objects, or engage in business, leaving them with little to do but chat and generally reducing confidence in all businesses on the grid.

Another problem is inventory loss,<sup id="cite_ref-142"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-142">[142]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-143"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-143">[143]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-144"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-144">[144]</a></sup> in which items in a user's inventory, including those which have been paid for, can disappear without warning or permanently enter a state where they will fail to appear in-world when requested (giving an "object missing from database" error). Linden Lab offers no compensation for items that are lost in this way, although a policy change instituted in 2008 allows accounts to file support tickets when inventory loss occurs. Many in-world businesses will attempt to compensate for this or restore items, although they are under no obligation to do so and not all are able to do so. A recent change in how the company handles items which have "lost their parent directory" means that inventory loss is much less of a problem and resolves faster than in recent years. "Loss to recovery times" have gone from months (or never) to hours or a day or two for the majority of users, but inventory loss does still exist.

_Second Life_ functions by streaming all data to the user live over the Internet with minimal local caching of frequently used data. The user is expected to have a minimum of 300 kbit/s of Internet bandwidth for basic functionality. Due to the proprietary communications protocols, it is not possible to use a network proxy service to reduce network load when many people are all using the same location, such as when used for group activities in a school or business.

### Quality assurance\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Quality assurance")\]

Criticism of [quality assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Quality_Assurance "Software Quality Assurance") of _Second Life_ states that [Linden Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linden_Lab "Linden Lab") focuses too much on bringing new features to the production environment instead of fixing long-standing bugs that, in the worst case, cause financial loss for the users. On April 30, 2007, an open letter signed by over 3,000<sup id="cite_ref-secondlife-openletter-signers_145-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-secondlife-openletter-signers-145">[145]</a></sup> users was sent to Linden Lab to protest the [quality assurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Quality_Assurance "Software Quality Assurance") process of the company.<sup id="cite_ref-secondlife-openletter_146-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-secondlife-openletter-146">[146]</a></sup> Linden Lab has responded to the open letter.<sup id="cite_ref-secondlife-openletter-response_147-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-secondlife-openletter-response-147">[147]</a></sup>

### Frame rate\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Frame rate")\]

Computer hardware and Internet connections capable of smoothly rendering high quality content in other [MMOGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMOG "MMOG") may perform poorly in _Second Life_, resulting in low [frame rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate "Frame rate") and unresponsive controls on even minimal graphical configurations. The problem is especially prevalent when large numbers of avatars congregate in one area. The problem is largely due to the fact that the world is entirely user created, and the majority of content created by users is made without any sort of basic graphical optimization. As a result, objects with both unnecessarily high polygon counts, and unnecessarily high resolution textures are prevalent. It is not uncommon for users to have to download and use upwards of a dozen times the amount of resources than would actually be required for the equivalent visual result. Certain areas have guidelines for script usage, which helps reduce lag by reducing resources used server-side, but does nothing to alleviate the primary issue above.

### Congestion\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Congestion")\]

A single region (65,536 m<sup>2</sup> of land hosted on a single [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU "CPU")) is set to accommodate a limited number of Residents (40 on 'mainland' regions, up to 100 on private islands), causing some popular locations such as teleportation points to become inaccessible at times. It is possible for an area of land a Resident has paid for to become inaccessible because another area in the same region has exhausted the avatar limit.

### Customer security\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: Customer security")\]

On September 8, 2006, Linden Lab released a news bulletin that revealed their _Second Life_ database had been compromised and customer information, including encrypted passwords and users' real names, had likely been accessed.<sup id="cite_ref-lindenblog-urgent-security-announcement_148-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lindenblog-urgent-security-announcement-148">[148]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-secondlifedotcom-security-bulletins_149-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-secondlifedotcom-security-bulletins-149">[149]</a></sup> However, it was later revealed that the hacker had in fact been focused on trying to cheat the in-world money system<sup id="cite_ref-lindenblog-security-breach-update_150-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lindenblog-security-breach-update-150">[150]</a></sup> and their access to personal information was believed incidental, although a full alert was still raised for safety's sake.

### Fraud and intellectual property protection\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Fraud and intellectual property protection")\]

Although _Second Life_'s client and server incorporate [digital rights management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management "Digital rights management") technology, the visual data of an object must ultimately be sent to the client for it to be drawn; thus unofficial third-party clients can bypass them. One such program, [CopyBot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CopyBot "CopyBot"), was developed in 2006 as a debugging tool to enable objects to be backed up, but was immediately hijacked for use in copying objects; additionally, programs that generally attack client-side processing of data, such as [GLIntercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GLIntercept&action=edit&redlink=1 "GLIntercept (page does not exist)"), can copy certain pieces of data. Such use is prohibited under the _Second Life_ TOS<sup id="cite_ref-151"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup> and could be prosecuted under the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act "Digital Millennium Copyright Act").

Linden Lab may ban a user who is observed using CopyBot or a similar client, but it will not ban a user simply for uploading or even selling copied content; in this case, Linden Lab's enforcement of intellectual property law is limited to that required by the "safe harbor" provisions of the [DMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA "DMCA") which used to require a regular mail DMCA complaint. However, since 2019 an electronic DMCA complaint form is also available.<sup id="cite_ref-152"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup>

A few high-profile businesses in _Second Life_ have filed such lawsuits,<sup id="cite_ref-153"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-153">[153]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-154"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-154">[154]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-155"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-155">[155]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-156"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-156">[156]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-157"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-157">[157]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Bundling_citations" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim has too many footnotes for reading to be smooth.

Linden Research, Inc. As of October 7, 2010, the case was transferred to private mediation and the plaintiffs filed for dismissal of charges on March 15, 2011.<sup id="cite_ref-161"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-161">[161]</a></sup>

Most users in the world as paying, private individuals are, likewise, effectively unprotected. Common forms of fraud taking place in-world include bogus investment and pyramid schemes, fake or hacked vendors, and failure to honor land rental agreements. A group of virtual landowners online have filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming the company broke the law when it rescinded their ownership rights. The plaintiffs say a change in the terms of service forced them to either accept new terms that rescinded their virtual property ownership rights, or else be locked out of the site.<sup id="cite_ref-162"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup>

### OpenSpaces\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: OpenSpaces")\]

Linden Lab, for a period, offered _Openspace_ regions to users: regions which were purchased in packs of four, with all four running on a single CPU core, intended to be placed next to an existing region to create the effect of larger size. The fee for 4 Openspaces was identical to that for a single private region. However, in March 2008, this rule was modified to permit Openspaces to be bought individually and placed elsewhere, as well as increasing the prim load each one could handle. Openspaces were made available for a US$415 downpayment plus a US$75 monthly fee.

In October 2008, Linden Lab announced that the Openspaces being used for this purpose were being misused; there was in fact no technical throttle limiting their usage. Linden Lab raised the monthly fee per Openspace to US$125, the same cost as half a region; added an avatar limit of 20; and renamed it to Homestead.

A week after the initial announcement Linden Lab stated its intention to add technical limits. A revised Openspace product, with far fewer prims, a no-residency rule, and costing the same monthly amount, was announced.

In May 2009, Linden Lab announced they were "grandfathering" Openspace sims (now rebranded as "Homesteads"), after a protracted protest movement<sup id="cite_ref-163"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup> caused a major amount of negative publicity and funded potential litigation.<sup id="cite_ref-164"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-164">[164]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-165"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup>

Some media attention has been given to sexual activity involving avatars with a childlike appearance.<sup id="cite_ref-newsdotcomdotcom-phony-kids-virtual-sex_166-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-newsdotcomdotcom-phony-kids-virtual-sex-166">[166]</a></sup> The United Kingdom<sup id="cite_ref-167"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-168"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-169"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-170"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup> and Germany<sup id="cite_ref-171"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup> are among the countries investigating new laws [to combat simulated child pornography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_status_of_fictional_pornography_depicting_minors "Legal status of fictional pornography depicting minors"). The USA has attempted to pass several laws forbidding simulated child pornography; however, each one has been struck down by the US Supreme Court as an infringement on the First Amendment right to free speech.<sup id="cite_ref-172"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup>

As of May 2007, two such countries, Germany and Belgium, have launched a police investigation into age of consent-related offenses in _Second Life_ (including both trading of non-virtual photography and involuntary virtual sexual activity with childlike avatars by means of virtual [identity theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft "Identity theft")).<sup id="cite_ref-173"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-174"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup> Linden Lab responded by issuing a statement that any "depiction of sexual or lewd acts involving minors" was a bannable offence.<sup id="cite_ref-175"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup>

In France, a conservative family union, [Familles de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Familles_de_France&action=edit&redlink=1 "Familles de France (page does not exist)"), sued Linden Lab in June 2007, alleging that _Second Life_ gave minors access to sexual content, including [bondage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondage_(BDSM) "Bondage (BDSM)"), [zoophilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia "Zoophilia") and [scatophilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophilia "Coprophilia"), as well as gambling, and advertisements for alcohol, drugs or tobacco.<sup id="cite_ref-176"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup> Linden Lab pointed out that the virtual world is not meant for children (people under the age of 18) because of the mature content and interactions within _Second Life_. However, minors aged between 13 and 17 can access _Second Life_, but they will be restricted to what they can see or do based on age.<sup id="cite_ref-177"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup> The _Second Life_ world is split into sections/worlds and each one is given a maturity rating similar to films: General, Moderate and Adult. Minors aged 13–17 can access areas with a General Rating only.<sup id="cite_ref-lindenlab.com-tos_178-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-lindenlab.com-tos-178">[178]</a></sup>

_Second Life_ Main Grid regions are rated either "General", "Moderate", or "Adult" (previously "PG", "Mature", or "Adult").<sup id="cite_ref-secondlifedotcom-kb-cs_179-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-secondlifedotcom-kb-cs-179">[179]</a></sup> Builds, textures, actions, animations, chat, or businesses that are of an adult nature are regulated by the _Second Life_ Terms of Service<sup id="cite_ref-secondlifedotcom-tos_180-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-secondlifedotcom-tos-180">[180]</a></sup> to only occur in simulators with a Moderate or Adult rating. General rated sims exist as an alternative for residents who do not wish to reside in areas where adult-oriented activities and businesses are permitted.

Linden Lab has created an Adult rated "mainland" continent named Zindra in response to its other "mainland" continents being mostly General.<sup id="cite_ref-secondlifedotcom-kb-cs_179-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-secondlifedotcom-kb-cs-179">[179]</a></sup>

### \[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: Unauthorized copying of content")\]

_Second Life_ features a built-in [digital rights management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management "Digital rights management") system that controls the movement of textures, sounds, scripts, and models with the _Second Life_ servers at Linden Lab. At some point, though, this data must be sent to a user's computer to be displayed or played—an issue fundamental to any system attempting to apply restrictions to digital information.

In November 2006 controversy arose over a tool called [CopyBot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CopyBot "CopyBot"), developed as part of [libsecondlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libsecondlife "Libsecondlife") and was intended to allow users to legitimately back up their _Second Life_ data. For a brief period, an unmodified CopyBot allowed any user to replicate SL items or avatars (although not scripts, which run only on the servers at Linden Lab). Later changes to the SecondLife protocols prevented unmodified copies of CopyBot from working. Nevertheless, the basic issue of users being able to duplicate content that is sent to them remains.

Residents who copy content belonging to other users face being banned from _Second Life_, but Linden Lab has so far never sued any of these users for copyright infringement; since the resident creators (and not Linden Lab) retain ownership of the rights, it is not clear whether Linden Lab would legally be able to do so. Linden Lab does, however, comply with DMCA [takedown notices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takedown_notice "Takedown notice") served to them against resident content; serving a DMCA Takedown Notice is the normal procedure recommended by Linden Lab for having copyrighted content illegally resold on _Second Life_.

Any user who uploads, publishes or submits any content keeps the intellectual property rights of that content, however both Linden Lab and other users gain their own rights from your content. Linden Lab receives a content license from anything a user uploads to the server. Section 7.3 of the _Second Life_ terms of service states; "you hereby automatically grant Linden Lab a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-license able, and transferable licence to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the content solely for the purpose of providing and promoting the service".

A user who uploads their content to a public area also gives a content licence to other users as well, which allows other users to replicate and record for use in Machinima (as outlined in section 7.4, Snapshot and Machinima Policy).<sup id="cite_ref-Second_Life_Terms_of_Service_181-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Second_Life_Terms_of_Service-181">[181]</a></sup>

Regardless of what rights and licences are given, Linden Lab takes no responsibility for the outcome of any dispute between users or the server regarding content. Section 10.2 states; "you release Linden Lab (and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, subsidiaries, and employees) from claims, demands, losses, liabilities and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have or claim to have with one or more users, including whether or not Linden Lab becomes involved in any resolution or attempted resolution of the dispute". Section 10.3 repeats a similar passage but regarding the responsibility of Linden Lab during any data or technical fault.<sup id="cite_ref-Second_Life_Terms_of_Service_181-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Second_Life_Terms_of_Service-181">[181]</a></sup>

## Litigation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: Litigation")\]

### _Bragg v. Linden Lab_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=41 "Edit section: Bragg v. Linden Lab")\]

In 2006, attorney Marc Bragg sued Linden Lab, claiming that it had illegally deprived him of access to his account<sup id="cite_ref-182"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup> after he discovered a loophole in the online land auction system which allowed regions to be purchased at prices below [reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_price "Reserve price"). Although most users and commentators believed that Bragg would have no chance of winning, a number of legal developments occurred as a result of the case, including a court ruling that parts of the _Second Life_ Terms of Service were [unenforceable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unenforceable "Unenforceable"), due to being an unconscionable [contract of adhesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_of_adhesion "Contract of adhesion").<sup id="cite_ref-183"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-183">[183]</a></sup> The case eventually ended with Bragg's virtual land and account being restored to him in a confidential [out-of-court settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-court_settlement "Out-of-court settlement").<sup id="cite_ref-184"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-184">[184]</a></sup> Since the settlement created no legal precedent, it left users with confusion as to what legal rights they truly had with respect to their virtual land, items, and account. Many of Bragg's legal arguments rested on the claim—advertised on Linden Lab web site—that virtual land within _Second Life_ could be "owned" by the purchasing user, which was removed shortly after the settlement.<sup id="cite_ref-185"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-185">[185]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-186"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-186">[186]</a></sup>

Eros, LLC and Shannon Grei brought forth a [class action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action "Class action") suit in US District Court in Northern California against Linden Research, Inc on September 15, 2009 (Case4:09-cv-04269-PJH).

### _Evans et al. v. Linden Lab_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=43 "Edit section: Evans et al. v. Linden Lab")\]

In 2010, a group of banned SL users filed suit against Linden Lab and CEO Philip Rosedale, in the same Pennsylvania Federal District Court that the Bragg case was adjudicated in, with the same judge, to deal with further land seizures and account suspensions by the Lab against various customers.<sup id="cite_ref-189"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-189">[189]</a></sup> Due to the Terms of Service agreement changes since the Bragg case, defendants attorneys successfully argued to move the suit to federal court in California, where the case lingered for several years. The judge did rule that there was a basis to turn the litigation into a class action, and that there were two classes under which claimants could file claims. The primary class was those who suffered economic damages to their livelihoods, through loss of their business revenues in _SL_. The secondary class was those who suffered property losses from loss of land, money on hand, and virtual goods in avatar inventories.<sup id="cite_ref-190"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-190">[190]</a></sup> In May 2013, attorney for defendants negotiated a settlement agreement with one of the lead attorneys that, in plain language, agreed to refund region setup fees for private island owners, pay land owners 2 Linden Dollars per square meter of virtual land, refund all L$ and USD amounts in the plaintiffs' accounts at the time of suspension, and allow the plaintiffs the option of either receiving $15US as compensation for loss of accounts and inventory virtual goods OR restoration of their accounts to sell their goods on the _SL_ Marketplace.<sup id="cite_ref-191"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-191">[191]</a></sup> The settlement agreement went to final hearing in March 2014, with an objection from claimant [Mike Lorrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mike_Lorrey&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mike Lorrey (page does not exist)") as to the vagueness of certain terms in the settlement as to which fees exactly would be refunded. With the resolution of that objection,<sup id="cite_ref-192"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-192">[192]</a></sup> claimants who had filed claims prior to March 28, 2014, began to receive settlement money a few months later.

## In popular culture\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Second_Life&action=edit&section=44 "Edit section: In popular culture")\]

Since its debut in 2003, _Second Life_ has been referred to by various popular culture media, including literature, television, film and music. In addition, various personalities in such media have themselves used or employed _Second Life_ for both their own works and for private purposes.

In September 2006, former [Governor of Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia "Governor of Virginia") [Mark Warner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Warner "Mark Warner") became the first politician to appear in a MMO when he gave a speech in _Second Life_.<sup id="cite_ref-193"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-193">[193]</a></sup> Musicians followed suit, with [Redzone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redzone "Redzone") being credited by _Wired_ and Reuters as the first band to tour in _Second Life_ in February 2007. Then, in June 2008, author [Charles Stross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross "Charles Stross") held a conference in _Second Life_ to promote an upcoming novel.<sup id="cite_ref-194"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup> _Second Life_ was also featured prominently, and used as a tool to locate a suspect, in the television show _[CSI: NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI:_NY "CSI: NY")_ in 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-195"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup> In the American sitcom _[The Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(U.S._TV_series) "The Office (U.S. TV series)")_, [Dwight Schrute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Schrute "Dwight Schrute") ([Rainn Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainn_Wilson "Rainn Wilson")) is known to play the game, most notably in the episode "[Local Ad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Ad "Local Ad")".<sup id="cite_ref-196"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup>

Much of the published research conducted in _Second Life_ is associated with education, learning, and data collection. Unlike computer games, _Second Life_ does not have a pre-defined purpose and allows for highly realistic enactment of real life activities online.<sup id="cite_ref-Wagner2009_197-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Wagner2009-197">[197]</a></sup> One such study tested the usefulness of _SL_ as an [action learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_learning "Action learning") environment in a senior course for management information systems students.<sup id="cite_ref-Wagner2009_197-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Wagner2009-197">[197]</a></sup> Another presented a case study in which university students were tasked with building an interactive learning experience using _SL_ as a platform.

There have also been healthcare related studies done of _SL_ residents.<sup id="cite_ref-Beard2009_202-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Beard2009-202">[202]</a></sup> Studies show that behaviors from virtual worlds can translate to the real world. One survey suggests that users are engaged in a range of health-related activities in _SL_ which are potentially impacting real-life behaviors.<sup id="cite_ref-Beard2009_202-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Beard2009-202">[202]</a></sup>

Another focus of _SL_ research has included the relationship of avatars or virtual personas to the 'real' or actual person. These studies have included research into social behavior and reported two main implications.<sup id="cite_ref-Harris2009_203-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Harris2009-203">[203]</a></sup> The first is that _SL_ virtual selves shape users' offline attitudes and behavior. The research indicated that virtual lives and physical lives are not independent, and our appearances and actions have both online and offline consequences.<sup id="cite_ref-Harris2009_203-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Harris2009-203">[203]</a></sup> The second deals with experimental research and supports the idea that virtual environments, such as _SL_, can enable research programs in that people behave in a relatively natural spread of behavioral patterns.<sup id="cite_ref-Harris2009_203-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Harris2009-203">[203]</a></sup> Remote [data collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_data_collection "Survey data collection") in SL must take into account issues related to research participant engagement, burden, and retention, as well as accuracy of the data collected.<sup id="cite_ref-204"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-204">[204]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-205"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup>

The _SL_ avatar-self relationship was also studied via resident interviews, and various enactments of the avatar-self relationship were identified. The study concluded that _SL_ residents enacted multiple avatar-self relationships and cycled through them in quick succession, suggesting that these avatar-self relationships might be shaped and activated strategically to achieve the desired educational, commercial, or therapeutic outcomes.<sup id="cite_ref-Schultze2009_206-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-Schultze2009-206">[206]</a></sup>

Anthropologist Tom Boellstorff describes the anthropological applications of studying _Second Life_ and its userbase in _Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human._ Boellstorff explores the relationship between anonymity and community when everyone in a community belongs to varying degrees of anonymity, and how this feeds into the idea of digital collectivity. He also comments on the phenomenon of data becoming "part of social context" that has been observed both inside and outside of _Second Life_ as surveillance becomes more integrated into everyday life. He stresses the difference between the concepts of anonymity and pseudonymity, identifying _Second Life_ users as belonging to the latter group of people – though their avatars are not directly linked to their real identities and reputations, they have forged new ones in this online space, a unique effect of creating an online persona in the digital age.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_40-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life#cite_note-:0-40">[40]</a></sup>
