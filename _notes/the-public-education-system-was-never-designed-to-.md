## the public education system was never designed to educate. 

it was designed to create punctual obedient workers who would do their job without question. free thought and critical thinking have never been a part of it. 

while the founder of the general board of education, john d rockefeller is quoted in the reel, his advisor, frederick t. gates, was even more open about the goals behind education when he said, “we shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or of science. we are not to raise up among them authors, orators, poets, or men of letters. we shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians. nor will we cherish even the humbler ambition to raise up from among them lawyers, doctors, preachers, statesmen, of whom we now have ample supply.”

the school system isn’t broken. it’s doing exactly what it was designed to do.
