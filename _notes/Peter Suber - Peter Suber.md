## My work and primary affiliations

-   I work for the free circulation of knowledge and research in every field and region. In practice that means education, collaboration, research, writing, tool-building, direct assistance, and _pro bono_ consulting for [open access](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Open_Access_(the_book)). I wear two hats:
    -   Senior Advisor on Open Access (in [Harvard Library](http://library.harvard.edu/)).
    -   Director of the [Harvard Open Access Project](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap) (in the [Berkman Klein Center](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/))

-   I'm a few steps into [phased retirement](https://cyber.harvard.edu/~psuber/wiki/Shifting_to_half-time).

-   My primary field is philosophy (Ph.D., Northwestern University, 1978). I'm also a non-practicing lawyer (J.D., Northwestern, 1982).

## Writings

My latest book is [_Knowledge Unbound_](http://bit.ly/ku-book) (MIT Press, 2016). It's available in paperback, hardback, and many open-access editions (same text, different file formats).

-   **On open access**
    -   See the [bibliography of my writings on open access](https://cyber.harvard.edu/~psuber/wiki/Writings_on_open_access "Writings on open access") (with links to OA editions).
    -   See the [backfile](https://web.archive.org/web/20210508012624/http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/archive.htm) of my newsletter (_Free Online Scholarship Newsletter_, 2001-2002, and _SPARC Open Access Newsletter_, 2003-2013)
    -   See the archive of my old blog, [_Open Access News_](https://web.archive.org/web/20110224045531/http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/fosblog.html) (2002-2010).
    -   See how my projects and writings could help those studying the [history of OA](https://cyber.harvard.edu/~psuber/wiki/History_of_open_access "History of open access")

-   **On topics other than open access**
    -   See the [bibliography of my writings](https://cyber.harvard.edu/~psuber/wiki/Writings "Writings") (with links to OA editions).

-   Nearly all my publications are open access from my [section of DASH](https://dash.harvard.edu/discover?filtertype_1=author&filter_relational_operator_1=contains&filter_1=&query=peter+suber&scope=%2F) (the Harvard open-access repository), my [old Earlham web site](https://web.archive.org/web/20110222153151/http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/hometoc.htm), a publisher's site, or some combination of these.
    -   One kind of exception is an older, print-only publication for which I don't yet have a digital edition. Over the years I've gradually created digital editions where I didn't have them, and I'm nearly done.
    -   Another kind of exception is a work for which I have a digital edition but not permission for open access. The only exception of this kind is [_The Case of the Speluncean Explorers: Nine New Opinions_](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/cse.htm) (Routledge, 1998). I published it before I started thinking hard about OA. I've asked Routledge to make the book OA, but it declined. I'm still willing to do so as soon as Routledge is. If Routledge doesn't make it OA while the book is still in print, then I'll make it OA as soon is it goes out of print, or as soon as I can revert the rights, whichever comes first.

-   Also see the [section on social media](https://cyber.harvard.edu/~psuber/wiki/Peter_Suber#Social_media) below.

## Academic interests

-   When I was a philosophy prof (1982-2003), I specialized in Kant and German idealism; the history of modern European philosophy, roughly from Montaigne to Nietzsche; the history of western skepticism from Socrates to the 20th century; epistemological and ethical issues related to skepticism, such as fictionalism, ideology, self-deception, and the ethics of belief; the logical, epistemological, ethical, and legal problems of self-reference; the metatheory of first-order logic; the ethics of paternalism, consent, and coercion; and the philosophy of law. I retain an interest in all these topics, and have since added some new ones: the connections between ancient Greek skepticism and Indian Buddhism (via Pyrrho), the naturalization of ethics, and concepts of randomness.

-   Since 2001 my interests have centered on policies, practices, and technologies that foster research, especially those that foster open access to research and the growth, quality, use, reuse, and usefulness of research. In addition to promoting these policies, practices, and technologies, I want to understand how the internet has changed research, how it ought to change research, and what it would mean to take full advantage of the internet for research.

-   Blogging
    -   From May 2002 to April 2010, I blogged heavily at [Open Access News](https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/fosblog.html), about 18,000 posts over 8 years, with occasional blogging partners. OAN was my attempt to stay on top of all that was happening with OA and share what I learned. It was useful while it lasted, but it didn't scale with the growth of OA. That failure to scale led me to launch the crowd-sourced, tag-based [Open Access Tracking Project](https://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Open_Access_Tracking_Project) in 2009, and lay down my blog about a year later. I explained why I was making the transition in a May 2009 [article](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/4322586) in my newsletter. OAN is preserved and searchable in several places, including the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110224045531/http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/fosblog.html). See [more details here](https://cyber.harvard.edu/~psuber/wiki/History_of_open_access#Open_Access_News_.282002-2010.29 "History of open access").
    -   From July 2011 to April 2019, I blogged lightly at [Google+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B), about 1,200 posts over 8 years. Google pulled the plug on G+ in April 2019 and deleted all the posts. However, I saved many of them to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) and nearly all of them to [Conifer](https://conifer.rhizome.org/petersuber/peter-suber-g-blog). Here's a [subset of them](https://cyber.harvard.edu/~psuber/wiki/Selected_Google_Plus_posts). [More details here](https://cyber.harvard.edu/~psuber/wiki/History_of_open_access#Google.2B_blog_.282011-2019.29 "History of open access").
    -   In May 2020 I started a [new blog on PubPub](https://suber.pubpub.org/). But I seldom post.

## Contacting me

-   My primary email addresses are [peter\_suber@harvard.edu](mailto:peter_suber@harvard.edu) and [peter.suber@gmail.com](mailto:peter.suber@gmail.com).
    -   I also use <psuber@cyber.law.harvard.edu> and <peter\_suber@g.harvard.edu>.
    -   I'm phasing out <psuber@law.harvard.edu>, <psuber@cyber.harvard.edu>, and <peters@earlham.edu>. If you have them in your address book, please replace them with one of the above.

-   Email is the best way to reach me. If you want to contact me by phone, text, Zoom, snail mail, or some other way, then send me an email and I'll tell you how.

-   All my Harvard work is [now remote](https://cyber.harvard.edu/~psuber/wiki/Shifting_to_half-time). It's no longer possible to meet F2F in Cambridge, call me at an office phone number, or send me snail mail to a campus address.
