## Formal Pragmatics?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/s2fec1/formal_pragmatics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/s2fec1/formal_pragmatics/)

> Syntax, and to a more controversial extent semantics, have both lent themselves fairly well to the logico-mathematical treatment, but what about Pragmatics?
> 
> What sort of work has been done in this area? I know that in “Between Saying and Doing”,  Robert Brandom put forward a model of deixis which is supposedly Turing computable, but I’m otherwise pretty clueless about this area. Is there any interesting overlap between Pragmatics and NLP/U?

	I'm curious about your comment: "to a more controversial extent semantics"

	"Formal pragmatics", the way I see it usually used, refers to applying techniques of formal semantics to pragmatic phenomena, e.g. presupposition or implicature. Some people may argue that these phenomena are semantic to begin with. In any case, because formal semantics is couched in logical formalisms, so too is this "formal pragmatics". You could check out Nirit Kadmon's book by the same name to see what kind of topics fall into this category.

	At the end, you asked about pragmatics and NLP; there is likely NLP research that aims to capture pragmatic phenomena, but I'm not too familiar with it. Related is computational pragmatics, such as the Rational Speech Act framework ([http://www.problang.org/](http://www.problang.org/)). They model human reasoning recursively to try to explain phenomena like scalar implicatures. These models are also mathematical in nature, but more on the probabilistic/statistical side, as opposed to the logical/algebraic kind used in formal semantics.

		Sure, I’ll start by saying that I’m coming into things from a Philosophy background, rather than linguistics, so that’s gonna explain a lot of my ignorance. Something I’ve wanted to ask is whether or not linguists ever get hung up on what seems like the metaphysical baggage behind some of the techniques and methods they employ, particularly within semantics. For example, model theoretic approaches seems to point implicitly or (or explicitly as in Jerrold Katz’s treatment) towards the existence of abstract objects, towards a kind of Platonism. Then of course, at least within Philosophy, there’s all sorts of controversies over how to interpret modals. 
		
		Never heard of RSA, but Problang looks really interesting, I’ll pull down the R package later today. Thanks for the link!

			You might be interested in [this paper](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Tim.Fernando/NLM/nlm.pdf).

			There are certainly some semanticists who think in this way. On the other hand, here's what Krifka said:
			
			> It was believed that model-theoretic semantics [as well as Davidson-style semantics] is forced to a ‘realistic’ view, in which natural-language expressions are interpreted by real entities, like objects and possible worlds, whereas cognitive semantics is concerned with cognitive models of reality. I don’t see that model-theoretic semantics has to be realistic in this sense. We can make use of the techniques developed in the model-theoretic tradition and assume that expressions are interpreted by elements of conceptual structures that in turn are related to ‘real’ entities by some extra-linguistic matching … [Semantics] attempts to capture certain properties of the way we see the world, not … to describe the world how it is.
			
			My impression is that the 'realistic' view is mainly held by semanticists with some background in philosophy, numbers of whom have declined as formal semantics has become a core part of graduate linguistics programs. Younger semanticists I have asked about this tend to either be agnostic or to take Krifka's view as given.

				Oooh, thanks! That paper looks interesting. I’ve learned a little bit about natural language ontology from the SEP, but would appreciate a linguists perspective.
				
				What Krifka paper is that from? That point is really interesting, and seems broadly congruent with what Paul Churchland tries doing in “Plato’s Camera”, developing a naturalistic account of how (biologically instantiated) neural nets form concepts and engage in abstraction.

					The Krifka paper is [here](https://semantics.uchicago.ed[u/kennedy](https://www.reddit.com/user/kennedy)/classes/s07/events/krifka98[ms].pdf). I came across the quote in [this paper](https://academic.oup.com/jos/article-abstract/34/3/373/3828469?redirectedFrom=fulltext), which is also relevant.

	Martina Wiltschko's 2021 book "Grammar of interactional language" could qualify I guess? It it at least pretty formal in the sense of making trees with movements. As an Interactional Linguist, I can't really explain that part or say that I'm a proponent of that approach.
