### Try a Policymaking Simulation

A policymaking simulation is an online process that puts citizens in the shoes of elected officials by simulating the process they go through in making policy decisions. Each simulation introduces a broader policy topic and then presents a series of modules that address a specific policy option that is currently under consideration in the current discourse. For each module, respondents:

1.  receive a short briefing on a policy issue and the option or options for addressing it;
2.  evaluate arguments for and against the policy options; and
3.  finally, make their recommendation for what their elected officials should do.

After taking the policymaking simulation, you’ll have the opportunity to **make your voice heard** by **sending your recommendations to your member(s) of Congress**. You will have the opportunity to add a personal note to your representative, or share more details about your recommendations, if you wish. VOP has worked with the [Program for Public Consultation](http://www.publicconsultation.org/) to develop simulations on the following issues. Give one a try!
