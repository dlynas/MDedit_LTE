### Israeli–Palestinian conflict [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Brooks_(political_commentator)&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Israeli–Palestinian conflict")

> So it's not a complex issue. That's the big thing. It's super simple. There's one group \[Israel\] that has enormous power. It's the most powerful country in the Middle East. It's backed by the United States. It acts on another population of people with total impunity. It is never held accountable for anything. So, there's no symmetry in the relationship, period.

—Michael Brooks<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brooks_(political_commentator)#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>

Brooks was critical of the Israeli government's handling of the [Israeli–Palestinian conflict](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict "Israeli–Palestinian conflict"). He called [Israel an "apartheid state"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_apartheid "Israel and apartheid") and said, "My Jewish values teach me to oppose apartheid".<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brooks_(political_commentator)#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> Brooks opposed [Israeli settlements](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement "Israeli settlement"), the [Israeli occupation of the West Bank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"), and Israel's military operations in the [Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip"). He also condemned [Hamas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas "Hamas") for killing and targeting civilians. Brooks believed that the [two-state solution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution "Two-state solution") to the conflict was a "dead, discredited process".<sup id="cite_ref-:1_55-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brooks_(political_commentator)#cite_note-:1-55">[55]</a></sup>

In 2019, Brooks praised presidential candidate [Bernie Sanders](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders "Bernie Sanders") for saying on _[Pod Save America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pod_Save_America "Pod Save America")_ that he would use US aid as leverage to get the Israeli government to act differently.<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brooks_(political_commentator)#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> He criticized presidential candidate [Andrew Yang](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yang "Andrew Yang") for saying he would not use US aid to Israel as leverage.<sup id="cite_ref-57"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brooks_(political_commentator)#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Brooks defended Representative [Ilhan Omar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilhan_Omar "Ilhan Omar") after she was accused of [antisemitism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism") due to her criticism of Israel.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brooks_(political_commentator)#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup>

After the [September 2019 Israeli legislative election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_Israeli_legislative_election "September 2019 Israeli legislative election"), Brooks expressed support for the Israeli political alliance the [Joint List](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_List "Joint List"), saying that it was "the only vehicle for pure democracy in Israel and Palestine that's electoral".<sup id="cite_ref-:1_55-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brooks_(political_commentator)#cite_note-:1-55">[55]</a></sup>

### Syrian civil war [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Brooks_(political_commentator)&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Syrian civil war")

Brooks argued that [Turkey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey")'s response to the [Syrian civil war](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war "Syrian civil war") under [Recep Tayyip Erdogan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan "Recep Tayyip Erdoğan") was partly an effort to erase [Kurdish culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_culture "Kurdish culture") in northern [Syria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria").<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brooks_(political_commentator)#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> He showed support and solidarity with the [Kurds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds "Kurds"), praising the socialistic, progressive aspects of their political culture.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brooks_(political_commentator)#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>
