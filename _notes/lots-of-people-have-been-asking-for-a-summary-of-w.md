## Lots of people have been asking for a summary of what’s been happening in Sudan. It’s hard to summarize 6+ months of war and devastation, but I tried my best. This is an oversimplified video that doesn’t even scratch the surface; consider it the first of many. I hope it helps.

"Hi, it's day 198 of the war in Sudan and I'm here to give you a quick and dirty what's been going on.
First up some geography. This is Sudan. We are a country in Africa,
reported by Egypt, Libya, Chad, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
We had a beautiful popular uprising turned revolution in 2019 that was totally ruined by these two
guys. On the right we have, we'll just call him Burhan. He's the leader of the Sunni's military
called Saf. On the left we have, we'll just call him Hamid. He's the leader of the rapid support forces
called the RSF. All come to the chase. They're both bad. Burhan is bad because he was part of the
military dictatorship. The Sunni's people were bolted against in 2019 in the first place and then
after the revolution instead of handing over power to a civilian government like everybody wanted,
he decided, nah, I want to be president. Hamid is bad because he's a psychopath. Before the
fancy uniform and the fancy title, he was leader of the Dengie. If you remember the Dad Ford War,
you know what the Dengie, the R, if you don't, then it is basically a militia contracted by the
Sunni's government to kill people in that form. Fast forward, he is legitimized by the Sunni's
government. They go from Dengie to rapid support forces. He gets a fancy uniform and a fancy
title. He emasses mountains of wealth and has aspirations to lead. Up until this started
tussling on April 15th, these two were essentially president and vice president of Sudan.
Now Burhan and Saf claim that the RSAF is a rebel militia. They're a terrorist organization
and that Saf is the one protecting us. Meanwhile, Hamid and the RSAF claim that they are
protectors of democracy, that they are fighting against Saf to rid it of the remnants of the
previous dictatorship by the U.S. So on April 15th, the war breaks out. It starts in Khartoum
essentially and then moves through cities and towns all through central Sudan and into
western Sudan. This by the way is a map from October 7th showing the number of displaced people
and where they were displaced to postry. Now, earlier I said they're both bad. That's true,
but the RSAF is a wayward. Over the last seven months, the RSAF has been committing
heinous crimes against the Sudanese people. Besides the indiscriminate killing and bombing,
they've also been raiding and looting towns, villages, neighborhoods, homes,
expelling people from their homes after they've raided and looted them and then sometimes even moving.
Sexual violence is also a weapon that they have often used the last six or so months and all of
these crimes that I've listed are part of their legacy dating back to when they were still the
gingerly. There is absolutely no way that I could list all of the devastating effects that this
war has had on Sudan and Sudanese people over the last six months in a three minute video.
And after practically six and a half months of fighting, Saf and the RSAF are currently
negotiations and can't even agree on the basics. And why would they need to when their funding is
still rolling in and the world has shown it does not care."
