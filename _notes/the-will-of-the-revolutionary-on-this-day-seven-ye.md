## THE WILL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY: On this day seven years ago, Zionist soldiers murdered the Palestinian revolutionary Bassel Al-Araj. He’d been released from the Palestinian Authority’s prisons the previous year after six months of torture and a prolonged hunger strike, and decided to go into hiding rather than risk re-arrest. It was there, in his clandestine home in the city of al-Bireh in the Occupied West Bank, that Al-Araj was martyred following an hours-long shootout with the IOF. 

Shortly before his martyrdom at age 33, Al-Araj wrote a short will:

“Is there anything more eloquent than the martyr’s act? I was supposed to write this months ago, but what kept me from doing so was your questions, you, the living. Why should I answer you, look for yourselves. As for us, the people of the graves, we are only looking for the mercy of God.”

A pharmacist by training, Al-Araj abandoned the field to devote himself to liberatory struggle. He read voraciously, both about the history of Palestine and the Arab region and that of revolutionary movements across the world, from Algeria to Vietnam to Cuba, drawing parallels between them and his homeland to understand conditions in Palestine after the signing of the Oslo Accords and the birth of the PA in 1993.

The 150,000 Algerians who fought alongside the French, he noted, were a comprador class that benefited from the occupation, just as the sentinels of the PA profited from the administration of an apartheid regime. On the question of whether the state could serve as a revolutionary apparatus, Al-Araj sided with Che Guevara over Fidel Castro: After Oslo, he wrote, “the obligations and duties of the state became a burden on the back of the revolution, at the expense of liberation.”

In death, Al-Araj became an icon. Young Palestinians, disillusioned by a once-revolutionary front that had become a colluding authority, looked to his teachings for radical alternatives to the inducements of consumerism and individualism. It was time, he argued, to reignite the spirit of the First Intifada: collective, unfettered, irrepressible. 

“Dismantle it,” he wrote of the state and its accomplices, “and let them fall.”
