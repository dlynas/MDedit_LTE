## The reference in the first slide to “CIA funded writing styles,” is in reference to the CIA’s role in developing MFA writing programs and the narrative form that has taken over literature and various media styles since the 40s and 50s. It is a writing style that was developed in response to the West’s fear of c0mmunism, with a focus on centering individual stories, decontextualized from material reality. I have not read the book, but “Workshops of empire,” deals with this topic in more detail, as I understand it. 

None of this post is to suggest that each person doesn’t matter. I also don’t want people to take it to mean that I am suggesting constantly seeking community approval. I hope my intention and messaging are clear. I wish someone woulda broke this down for me when I was younger. I see a lot of people, even my age and older, post parenting, entering into these story lines. We will not get free alone. We will get free together.
