Was just doing research and found this quote by former Biden official Dr.

who resigned over Gaza. "I have a young daughter. She’s not yet 2, but if some day in the future, she is learning about this and knows that I was at the state department and she asked me \[about it\] – I want to be able to tell her that I did what I could.”



I'm putting together a list of all Biden officials who left and what they said. I also want to correlate it with what was happening in Gaza at the time. If anyone wants to help me, hit me up.

My hope is this list 1) encourages more resignations 2) encourages more resignations and 3) encourages more resignations

How does willingly leaving the room where decisions are made, where you might have been able to influence people toward your cause, help anyone or anything except your own feeling of self-righteousness? It's an empty gesture.

People in that meeting stated it was done for show, that there were no decisions being made or power being offered. So perhaps walking out was the most powerful action. I always assume people act based on information we don't have, and did what's right for them.

I know what I think of Biden’s presidency: it is a complete FAILURE. But I need to hear back from you! Which of Biden’s failures make you MOST want to support President Trump at the polls this November? Take the Survey NOW!

Beautiful and meaningful quote. (btw my last name is an adaptation of Bukhara hence same here except several centuries ago, visited UZ too to “reconnect”)

Nice! Hope you had a great time I loved visiting

I remember that, it was from an interview she did on Democracy Now. I was watching it live when she said it. Incredibly touching.

Worth compiling a list of Zionist universities also so that parents can avoid sending their kids to places that do not tolerate free speech.

She did literally nothing, despite having some access to the levers of power. If she wanted to do something good she could have gummed up the gears of State.

In 27 years of working at State never in my career has there been so much anger and internal dissent on any foreign policy issue. And yet that anger has produced very few resignations. No judgment here. Folks have kids, mortgages and college tuition. npr.org/2024/04/29/124

This is very admirable. The people making excuses to their children will sound like the nazis after wwii.

Sheline is in line with herstory...

If I’m her daughter, I’d ask, “So you joined a lying blood libel campaign after they massacred the Israelis because it seemed right to cover for those who did it?”

Why do so many of you have eyes so close together if I squint, you look like a cyclopes? Is that a side effect of inbreeding?

So now if your Palestinian in Germany you have to register stateless… Genocide intent from Germany

Palestinian students at Otto von Guericke University in Magdeburg, Germany received an email from the school that they’ve been recategorized as “stateless” due to governmental “changes in the statistical requirements.” Germany no longer recognizes Palestinian as a nationality.
