-   China is the continent’s biggest bilateral creditor but most of the debt is due to private Western holders of African debt, according to a new report

The rise in African debt due to Chinese lending pales in comparison with the debt burden created by private creditors in the last decade, according to a new report taking aim at accusations that Beijing engages in “[debt-trap diplomacy](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3157549/china-still-committed-africa-despite-covid-19-disruption?module=inline&pgtype=article)” on the continent.

The study – by Harry Verhoeven from the Centre on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, and Nicolas Lippolis from the department of politics and international relations at the University of Oxford – says the debt-trap narrative is a function of China-US strategic and ideological rivalry rather than a reflection of African realities or perspectives.
