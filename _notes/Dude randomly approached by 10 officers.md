	Jump-out squad. They do this to instigate a reaction. If you run or flinch or freeze up or even look suspicious, they use that as justification to slam you to the ground, at which point you have a resisting charge and probably a battery on LEO charge as well. This person remained cool as ice, so they left. They're basically pack predators who attack when they sense fear, like some B grade horror movie monster.

	This is how the police terrorize a community and perpetuate the criminal culture they claim to be trying to eliminate.

		Literally what the fuck man. That's exactly what it looks like. When 10 people swarm you, it's safe to assume you're going to get attacked. That shit needs to be illegal.

			It's a real thing, for those who may not know. 
			
			[There was a lawsuit](https://thecrimereport.org/2023/02/06/lawsuit-alleges-d-c-police-practiced-illegal-jump-outs/) brought by a police Sergeant and 18 year veteran of the MPD in Washington, D.C. regarding the practice. And would you look at that? As soon as she tried to be a good cop, [they punished her](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/investigations/veteran-sergeant-sues-dc-police-claiming-retaliation-for-reporting-improper-tactics/65-5aba5f74-e349-427f-88ad-8adbd5a43a3b). 
			
			They also use the tactic to [black-bag protesters](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a33457941/nypd-protest-unmarked-vans-plainclothes-officers-arrest/).
			
			And they do it all over the country, [from Portland to NYC to Philly](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/jump-out-boys-videos-protesters-getting-picked-up-unmarked-police-cars-spark-outrage-many-say-not-new-205040238.html).
			
			If we had videos of Chinese police doing this, every American politician from every party would be talking about what a fascist police state they are. But here at home, they all ignore it at best, or defend it at worst.

			I had one drive past me when I was riding my bike when I was like 12, my mom was walking beside me and the bastard dove by, spun around and then flew up to the curb telling us to stop
			
			It felt like he did that shit to get a reaction and said my bike fit a description..
			
			But when that shit actually got stolen a few months later they weren't any help

			It is illegal, obviously they have no RAS. But there's no police to police the police and enforce the law in the interest of non-police.

		You nailed it. They utilize similar, if less obvious, tactics accross the board.
		
		"Do you know why I pulled you over?" - an attempt to get you to out yourself for something they weren't aware you did.
		
		"Stop resisting" (while your in handcuffs on your belly) - so they can charge you with resisting.
		
		Unmarked cars and speed traps - simply hiding to impose fines.
		
		The entire organization is aimed at suppression of the population and compliance. They could not care less about your safety or wellbeing.

					Of course, there are no repercussions. It needs to be taken to a constitutional challenge. And hopefully it is backed by the 4th amendment. Then there will be some substance to back it

			I was pulled over for DWB, but I'm white.  It was night, and I was a 15 year old Nissan behind a well kept Cadillac (Fleetwood?), and behind me was a brand new Mazda 626.
			
			He couldn't see the driver from his hiding spot, and when he pulled me over, when he knew I did nothing wrong and his pretext failed, he still asked me "do you know why I pulled you over?".  So I shot him a "you are wasting my time" look and tone and said "nooooo?" (Trying to hit the tone and attitude of a local), so he checked for wants and warrants and waived me on.
			
			I was so glad it was quick.  The 626 behind me was my mother, and we were going home from the non-profit she started, where she worked and I volunteered.  She circled the block and pulled in behind, and I was worried she would go off on the cop.  I didn't notice she had circled around until we pulled out, but we were finishing up as she got there.
			
			This was in a town which would arrest brown people at bus stops for "loitering".  They had to stop when they arrested the beloved housekeeper/nanny of a couple who were both lawyers, and they (literally) made a federal case out of it.
			
			That's how I know it was DWB.  My older car is not typical for the area, and people in r/cars and elsewhere still make fun of Nissan as a "ghetto" car.  It had that reputation back then, even for the special editions like my 200SX V6.  I miss that car.  But when I sold it and bought a new car, I never got pulled over since.  It's been 20+ years.
			
			It's amazing how much the presumed demographic of the driver influences the chance of getting pulled over.
			
			Wait, what were we talking about?  I'd like a baconator.
			
			Oh yeah, on a (failed) pretext stop where I was doing nothing wrong and had a witness proving innocence, they still asked me why they pulled me over.  Because they are crooks and are targeting a type more than impartially enforcing law.

			> Do you know why I pulled you over?
			
			Only time I got asked that I just said "why?" like it was a rhetorical question. I thought that was a pretty good response.
			
			Every other time they just straight up tell me.

			Not your fault. A lot of people don't know about this. And yeah, it's super old. I'm 49 and grew up on the rez and they would pull this shit when we took one step off the rez. Every damn time. 
			
			One time when I was maybe 17, it was me and a couple friends going to the store for soda. The nearest store was just off the rez. As soon as we crossed the street, they came out of the woodwork. 4 cruisers, 2 cops in each one. Guns drawn. They lined us up against the wall of the Circle K and frisked us but got nothing. One cop says, "if it was up to me, I'd have *all of them* lined up like this and *blam blam blam*", as he does the finger gun thing. They all laugh and nod in agreement.
			
			We knew what he meant by "all of them". They were never shy about letting us know they thought of us as subhuman.
			
			That was one of hundreds of experiences that radicalized me as a kid.
