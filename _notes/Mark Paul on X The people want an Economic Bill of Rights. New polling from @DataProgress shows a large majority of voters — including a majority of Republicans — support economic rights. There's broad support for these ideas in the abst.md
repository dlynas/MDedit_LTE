First: Explain how we got here. How did freedom become associated w/ limited government + "free" markets, & how was the term monopolized by the right? What led to this collective failure w/ terrible impacts for our national policy discussions + political imaginations?

Second: Show how economic rights — housing, jobs, healthcare — have been a part of the American conversation from Day One. Economic rights were a part of the New Deal + Civil Rights Movement, whose leaders saw them as key to be fully realized along w/ civil + political rights.

Third: The bulk of the book digs into policy the policy \* economic details. How do we actually deliver economic rights? Can we afford college for all? Can we deliver on universal healthcare? If it possible to end unemployment & poverty wages? How will we pay for all of these?

The people want an Economic Bill of Rights. New polling from

shows a large majority of voters — including a majority of Republicans — support economic rights. There's broad support for these ideas in the abstract & when details are provided [filesforprogress.org/memos/dfp\_econ](https://t.co/VNB2cm8UvG)
