				I have a coworker who literally screams into the phone all day. I would hurt my voice speaking that loudly for even a minute. I can hear him across the office, over cubicles with like ten other people talking on the phone. He's been asked to keep it down but apparently he's an idiot with no control over himself. The phone is an INCH from your mouth, they don't have to actually hear the sound from where you're sitting. Every day I just want to go over there and shove the phone down his throat. I've had to resort to keeping an earbud in one ear playing loud white noise to drown him out. I can't use my voicemail when he's talking because it's voice activated and it thinks I'm saying NEXT VOICEMAIL or something because he's talking so loud. If I call someone sitting near him, I can't hear them over him through THEIR microphone.

		My boss was *just* telling me today that at his rotary meeting a teenage girl was there from a local juvenile delinquent center. She was sharing her story of how she ended up at the facility. She was texting and driving, blew through a stoplight, and killed three people. She said while she was in the back of the ambulance there was a little girl along side her and the little girl asked her who she was. She told the little girl her name and the girl asked, "Are you the one that killed my daddy?"

			I've noticed over the last 5 years that people have become less aware when driving. It's gotta be the phones, I don't know what else it could be. It's like people forget they're driving these huge hunks of metal that can smash into a wall and kill you instantly unless you fully pay attention.

				It's terrifying. After a while you really start to notice the people who are trying to text on the sly. Holding their phone down low and taking cursory glances down. Hell, even ones who aren't even trying to be sneaky. I see a handful of people doing it everyday on my 5 minute commute. Spotting texters has almost become a game I play when I drive (also just a good defensive driving skill).
				
				The worse part is that people think they're really capable of texting and driving. Nothing is going to change their minds until something bad happens. Smart people know they're human and subject to making mistakes, so they don't risk it. There's no text that can't wait, and if there is, just pull over for a minute or call.

It's even scarier knowing this shit happens when I'm on city streets and I'm riding my bike. I know I can get hit from behind or someone can easily run a light and clip me. I've already been hit 3 different times and I stopped counting how many times I personally avoiding an accident because I was super aware of my surroundings.

		I was arguing with someone about the validity of gender dysphoria as a diagnosis. I told him it's in the DSM 5 and has an ICD code so obviously it has scientific merit. But no he wanted scientific papers saying it was a real thing. He wanted *me* to look them up because, and I quote, "he doesn't care enough to look it up."
		
		Excuse me. If you can't be bothered to do some research about something you have a strong opinion so thay you can defend your viewpoint.... Then you don't get the right to have that strong opinion.  It would have been more acceptable  for him to have said he doesn't believe in it because of a few random papers saying it doesn't exist. At least in that case he put in effort even if he cherry picked the poorly done papers.
		
		But no. He doesn't believe in gender dysporia based on the logic of his own narrow minded existence

	In the United States the First Amendment means that the *government* cannot restrict your free speech. It does not mean that your employer, your condo association, Starbucks, the owner of your local pub, or the members of your wankers anonymous club are prohibited from restricting your speech. 

	If you say something stupid, there can be consequences. Your employer can fire you, your condo board can make you take your sign down, Starbucks can kick you out, the Pub owner can 86 you, and the wankers anonymous club punish you as they see fit. 

	You can't go screaming "FREE SPEECH!" when you get fired for tweeting something racist or when you say something shitty and the bartender tells you to shut the fuck up or get out. 

	Your right to free speech means that the government cannot limit your free speech. That's it. Everyone else in your life can and will. 

	So keep your opinions to yourself if they're fucking stupid.

		Understand that organizing a campaign of literally hundreds or thousands of people online to disclose your home address, threaten your family, SWAT your home, and non-stop harass your employer so that they fire you; not because you did anything wrong but because the online hate campaign is too damaging to their business, is called a *chilling effect* on free speech through the criminal acts of harassment, assault, conspiracy, misuse police resources, ect.
		
		So yes, freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences *to a degree*. If your actions are criminal in nature, they aren't valid consequences. If you've done them to crush opposing political opinions, you're a thug.
		
		"We think your opinions don't reflect our corporate value" is not the same kind of consequence as "I'm sorry, but that's the 3rd bomb threat this week. It's too dangerous to keep you on the job."

		Free speech is more than a legal concept, and if we wanna stay on point with the topic, then I'd say that your post is a perfect example of a piece of common sense that is becoming very uncommon.
		
		There is this fairly new meme that constantly gets spouted, that free speech applies only to the government. Not only does this ignore the spirit of the First Amendment, it implies that the rest of the amendments to the U.S. constitution should be equally ignored in the realm of social/private interaction. By your logic, cruel and unusual punishment is perfectly acceptable, provided it is not done by public officials.
		
		You also completely ignore the concept of a chilling effect, when the social reaction to someone's speech can be exponentially worse than what the government is capable of inflicting upon someone, while also giving weight to the idea that the majority should be able to dictate the speech of everyone else. I have to wonder if you would feel the same 60 years ago, when people who spoke out in favor of civil rights were routinely harassed, shamed, and intimidated by members of their own communities, because their opinions were seen as "fucking stupid", as you so eloquently put it. Given the absolutely mind boggling amount of power that companies like Google, Facebook, and twitter have over the way in which people communicate, it should be a problem when they can dictate which ideas and opinions are "correct".
		
		The "Free speech only applies to the government" argument is one that is only ever touted by people who have never held a controversial opinion in their lives, and who have never had to do anything more than go with whatever opinion was popular at the given moment. People like you are why the man who suggested that doctors wash their hands after handling dead bodies ended up being committed by his colleagues, for daring to suggest that doctors having dirty hands might be why so many newborn babies were dying of disease. People like you are why it took so long for blacks to be able to vote.
		
		You have no concept of the deeper value in what it is that the Bill of Rights was founded upon. You fail to realize the inherent obligation that a society owes to itself to abide by the same rules it demands of its government. The worst of it all, is that like everyone else who repeatedly spouts off with this same exact phrase, you don't truly believe in it. You only support the notion, because you feel that you always have been, and always will be, in the right.

			Free speech is a right that can come in conflict with others, which is one of the main reasons we don't force the private sector to endlessly tolerate anything someone wants to say.
			
			Should people have the right to enter your house against your will to make you listen to their religious beliefs?  Should an employer be forced to allow an employee to tell their gay customers that their homosexuality disgusts them?  Should a forum be forced to allow one of its members to stalk and harass another with abusive messages?
			
			Those examples are places where property rights, and the right of freedom of association, and the rights both to feel safe and the victim's free speech itself would be abused if free speech was an unlimited right that trumped all others.  This is why the First Amendment says, "Congress shall make no law," not "No man shall."
			
			To demand otherwise is to restrict the right of one man's freedom of thought and expression to the benefit of another's.

		Had a walk in the park recently with my family. There was a wedding that looked like it was about to start so out of respect I took an outer route to avoid them. Well nothing was happening and everyone was just sitting around so we took a different route because we were going to the rose garden when my husband and I got married. Then this lady comes down the stairs in front of us and says "can y'all hurry up your walk, we're having a wedding here!"  So I told her while pointing to the left that we were going that way and she said "we need that side too!"  So I asked here where exactly she wanted us to go. She said "I don't care but I don't want your fat asses in our pictures". So my husband simply laughed and said "we got married here too. There were other people. We survived". And we walked to the left and sat down. We went out of our way for a good thirty minutes to avoid the wedding. It's a public park. There are other people. I may have went further and out of the way if she was nicer. But she was a bitch from the get go. 
		
		Another instance my husband and I were in a small town for the Fourth of July. We found a spot and sat our chairs down and this lady jumps up and says we cannot sit there. We tell her it's a public street, no one is sitting there, were going to sit here. She says they have a small child coming who is going to sit there. We ask why they didn't set up a chair. No response. She proceeds to shove my husbands chair out of the way. He puts it back. Her husband stands up and says he doesn't want to have to call the police. Call the fucking police. Because I'm sitting on a public street to see a public parade. In the end there was no small child and their area going surrounded by people. Since you know, there was a parade and all. The lady's chair then broke. Karma. Don't be a rude fuck for no reason!!

		Mmm, a story I like to tell along these lines.
		
		I used to work at a facility that had something like 1-2K workers in it. Whenever you enter the gate, you have to show the guards your company ID as you go. You don't have to stop (unless they tell you), just roll the window down, hold it up and go.
		
		Every day, rain or shine, I'd roll the window down and say "Hello, have a nice day!" as I drove by, and conversely "Have a nice night!" on my way out. Well, after about three months of working there, I was walking through the hall (on my way back from a rather lengthy bathroom break....I blame my lunch) when about 5-6 of the security guards popped up around me.
		
		At first I thought that I was getting fired for the bathroom break or something, when one of them stepped forward and handed me a bag of homemade cookies. She said to me "I just wanted to let you know that out of all the two thousand employees here, you are the ONLY person that tells us to have a nice day. You have no idea how happy that makes us.". I was honestly shocked that this was true, but given the looks on their faces I see no reason why they would lie about that. Even now it still makes me tear up a little when I think about it.

				You are welcome! I'm sure there is the random power tripping guard, but almost every time I've seen a guard not being nice, I can see that the fault was originally with "my people".
				
				An example being that one day I was out of my secure area doing work in a lab (at a different facility than the first story). When I finished and decided to head home, I found out that everybody had already sealed the secure area. So I went down to security to have them open it (since I didn't know how). The guard there was SUPER defensive saying that "My fellow guard is on her rounds, procedure says she has to finish, I cant leave the guard shack, so you're going to have to wait an hour Sir!", but it was clear that when this sort of thing happened before the response from the person in my position was to rant and yell at them. The look of shock on her face when my response was "Alright, guess I'll get some more work done, see you in an hour!" was pretty great. She was very apologetic when I came back later.
				
				But yeah, clearly her reaction was because people in my position hadn't been very nice. :( Sorry about that. >.&lt;

The result was that I became acquainted with most of all the teachers and staff in primary and high school.

What really gets me is when it's parents walking with their children. The parents are essentially teaching the kids that rules of the road aren't that important. Even though they're about the most critical thing imaginable. 

	Even if pedestrians have the right of way, look. It's still a 4000-pound hunk of metal vs. a pathetic cocoon of flesh and blood. You're going to lose every time.

		I had a kid walk directly in front of my car, didn't look before he stepped out, not in a crosswalk. I honked and he he stared me down and then flipped me off, cursing as he walked to the other side of the road. Yes of course, I'm the one who is wrong here.

These people are trying their best, and this type of advice only makes them feel like failures for not being able to live up to it.

	Since Facebook, this just doesn't apply anymore whatsoever, and people spend *hours* a day minding everyone else's business.  It's actually nuts when you think about it.

	Somewhat off-topic but anyone else who has done reasonably get friend requests from the most annoying people?

	No, ex-girlfriend from high school (read - two weeks of not being able to sort out free time together), I don't fucking care what you're doing now, and I don't want to 'have a chat soon'. You can send me all the sad faces you want, your friend request remains unanswered for over a year now. Fuck off.... No, guy I barely knew from 1L, I don't care 'where everyone all ended up', and we aren't meeting for any reason, let alone to discuss that. I know everything I need to know about anyone I care about.

	That also drives me insane.

	Overall, that people with different beliefs can coexist. As much as this upcoming election sucks in general, the amount of people i've heard saying, "I won't be friends with a Trump supporter" and whatnot just bums me out. Like, if one of us wants more environmental regulation, and one of us supports fracking, it seriously doesn't matter at all as far as our human relationship is concerned. All we need to do is vote for what we believe in and maybe not debate issues we can't keep our cool when discussing. 

	Also, seriously, don't live above your means.

	I am completely dumbfounded by how many times I've stopped to hold a door for someone without receiving even so much as a nod. The other day while at the grocery store, I moved my shopping cart so a man could get by. Rather than saying excuse me, he rolled his eyes. As if he couldn't believe I hadn't cleared the way for him before he had approached. It's sad to me that I have better manners at 25 than many people twice my age.

	Slow walkers, do you just exist to inconvenience the world at large? I'm so tired of circumventing around the 'stop, wait-until-person-behind is now in close proximity before I start walking again at an excruciatingly slow pace' crowd. I'm hearing impaired yet still manage to maintain spatial awareness at all times, YOU HAVE NO PLAUSIBLE EXCUSE NOT TO KNOW UNLESS YOU'RE BLIND! In which case, you won't see this any way.

	Families monopolizing a narrow path by walking in a horizontal line 6 people across...MOVE THE FUCK OVER OR GET IN THE SCATTER FORMATION! Why, why are you so insolent and just plain asinine? 

	We need giant conspicuous walking etiquette signs to clearly illustrate how to walk with consideration and they need to be implemented on every street corner and public footpath.
