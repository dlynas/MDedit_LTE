	Great list! Gotta add "move every day" too. Some form of physical activity is necessary to be physically and mentally healthy.

			Maybe more important than any of the above in alot of ways, though it's more well known so it's ok not to have been included

	Thanks for this it’s useful. I can vouch for the cold showers and baths they really do help. 

	My question is how on earth does one find a mentor?

	Especially when they don’t know anyone that is a few steps ahead of them.

		Secular mindfulness meditation specifically is well researched and has a variety of benefits. This link is not a study, but to the APA page regarding mindfulness meditation. About four paragraphs down is a series of hyperlinks on the specific benefits to each study which supports the claim: https://www.apa.org/topics/mindfulness/meditation

			>We found either low evidence of no effect or insufficient evidence of any effect of meditation programs on positive mood, attention, substance use, eating, sleep, and weight. We found no evidence that meditation programs were better than any active treatment (drugs, exercise, other behavioral therapies).

	*>Anything else you have to do afterward will seem easy.*  

	This is so true. However people will agree with this after they experience it on their own skin, for that they must do those things on the list which I did and can confirm, everything else becomes easy, organized, clear and it is as if I don't use much willpower to do the rest.

* 🟩 **[PutSimply1](https://www.reddit.com/user/PutSimply1)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-08-29 06:14:19)_

	Great list, good note on meditation too, it's funny how people see that as the sit down cross legged thing

	When really, all you need to do, is be present minded and think deep about what you're doing/what you want

	I do this laying on the bed with music in - that's the action that allows me to 'access' that thought state 

	One thing i would add, is when you wake up, try to wake up to a light source rather than a sound - fantastic addition to my life

	How long do I get sunlight for and write about what exactly?

	* 🟨 **[xKAMOx](https://www.reddit.com/user/xKAMOx)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-08-29 08:01:01)_

		Anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on cloud coverage. If it's completely overcast, you might want to spend 30 minutes in the sunlight. Even if there is no direct sunlight, you get most of the benefits of being exposed to it. Just remember not to look directly into the sun and avoid wearing sunglasses and looking through car windows, as they filter UV rays

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-08-29 10:16:28)_

	I read exact the same thing in one book called miracle mornings or something like that

* 🟩 **[SnooBooks4350](https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooBooks4350)** ⬆️ 1 _(2023-09-06 07:20:50)_

	Great list! Also, if you are easily distracted - Put away your mobile for chunks of time. Turn it to DND and put it in a drawer. Treat it almost like the home phone of old, when you never saw it when away from home. Determine that you'll check it after certain periods of time, if you need to concentrate on a report or some other piece of work. If needing to concentrate, do not keep it by your side, put it out of sight!

	Here is my Journaling Template. It is optimized to stay on track towards my goals and staying in an optimal mental/bodily state - more about productivity, less about creativity

	```

	# 1. Goal Review

	- Yesterday's Progress: 

	- Today's Focus: 

	# 2. Emotional Check-In

	- How did I feel yesterday? 

	- What is a good trait about myself? 

	- What did I learn about myself?"

	- How do I feel today? 

	- What can I do to feel better today? 

	# 3. Challenges and Solutions

	- What might slow me down today: 

	- How can I fix that: 

	# 4. Self-awareness

	- did i fall into a behavior pattern I have previously identified as detrimental to my energy-levels or emotional stability?

	- What are my instructions to fix this bodily/mental state?

	# 5. Priority Action

	- What is the highest Value action I can take today to progress my 12-week-year goals: 

	- Why is this action valuable?

	```
