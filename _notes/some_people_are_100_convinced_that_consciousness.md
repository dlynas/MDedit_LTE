## Some people are 100% convinced that consciousness goes on after the body dies while others are 100% convinced that consciousness stops when the body dies. How can each side declare themselves right with such conviction?

	-People of all kinds seem to cling to/identify with their beliefs as if they're a physical part of them that need defending. 

	-People of all kinds also seem subject to ingroup ideology, not wanting to go against the tribe's narrative. 

	-People on both sides of this can be equally unreasonable and dogmatic. 

	-I suspect that those heavily on the survival after death side may be subject to the above, as well as fear of death skewing perception, though 

	-I've met people who have said that they find the prospect of eternity, living forever, etc. to be scarier to them than non-existence, so both sides could be said to be potentially motivated by fear. 

	-I think a lot of people heavily against beliefs of survival do so because their persona is heavily made up of "scientist", "intellectual", etc., they wrongly conflate scientific with atheist, physicalist, scientistic (ironically, as its an incredibly unscientific stance to hold to anything unproven dogmatically), and they fear acknowledging evidence that physicalism can't explain as they fear that if they do, that others will perceive them, just as they presently perceive others, e.g. as fools.

			>Out of curiosity, do you have a horse in this race?
			>
			
			My main horse in the race is re: the overall reasoning of people in the debate, as opposed to the end outcome arguments. That's the present emotional motivation that fuels my interest in most of this discussion these days, as I presently find it quite frustrating that those wearing a mask of science are concurrently disrespecting it. 
			
			
			>Do you lean toward believing there is consciousness post death?
			>
			
			
			I'm still agnostic re: it, but the more I look into the research, the more stuff I find that's in favour of the survival hypothesis that emergentist, materialist, physicalist, atheist, naturalist models cannot explain. Further, considering the, at most times, full blown denial if not delusion of many people proposing to be pro science re: this stuff and ignoring empirical data, it ironically strengthens my leaning towards the survival hypothesis, as their refusal to acknowledge it, let alone refute it leaves me with little other logical choice. 
			
			
			
			>Also, do you hope for it or hope for nothing?
			>
			
			I hope for it, of course. I don't want to stop existing, and I especially don't want goodbyes re: loved ones to be permanent. 
			
			Though, as I think I mentioned in a previous discussion, I have already been through a long phase of coming to terms with emergentist models and death, for a while leaning way more towards consciousness not surviving, so I recognise the bias now. Ultimately, it doesn't matter though: empirical data is empirical data. I think that I have mistaken people confidently posing as being scientific, as if hanging out with the big kid in class (the dominant paradigm of materialism-physicalism, mistaking them and reporting them to be synonymous with science) to make themselves feel tougher, for them being correct. More and more, now though, it seems like a total farse.

					Sure. My early years were heavily into a lot of stuff like this, at the expense of other areas of inquiry (modern psychology and psychotherapy, which is now my clinical area; Western philosophy, etc.). 
					
					I'm still open to it. 
					
					Presently, I find Hegel (at least Hegel proposed by Peter Kalkavage) to be the most *intriguing:  
					
					
					"Spirit comes to know itself, not through calm methodical inquiry but through passionate self- assertion. Spirit is spirited. As we see repeatedly in Hegel's examination of spirit's claims to know, this spirited self-risking is spirit's folly: all the claims fall to the ground. They do so because they are finite or partial, because they fail to capture the whole of truth. But the act of positing is also spirit's bravery. Spirit cannot make progress, or even make a beginning, without self- assertion and positing. It cannot become wise with out making a fool of itself. An extremist at heart, spirit, our human essence, is fated by the demands of its nature to learn through suffering."
					
					"Christianity makes up for this lack by assimilating mortality into the nature of God. It posits a God who "emp ties himself, into time, deathifies himself, and thus becomes present both to mankind and to himself: God suffers in the form of human history. This human-divine suffering is necessary in order for God to know himself and to become actual. Christianity also gives birth to the idea that God manifests himself in community. Both together-the divine as pure thinking, and the divine as the suffering God who is present in history and in human com munity-go together to produce spirit." 
					
					"All are stages on the way to the fully developed selfhood that is spirit." 
					
					"The history of philosophy, for Hegel, is the interconnected series of efforts to reach truth in a purely conceptual way. Wisdom emerges as a pro cess of becoming, and all the great philosophic systems of the past con tribute to the full flowering of wisdom." 
					
					
					"Spirit is not the divine puppet-master who plans everything out in advance and moves his story toward a providential end. Time is not a cloak that spirit wears but the outpouring of what spirit is. History is spirit wandering in its self-created labyrinth, searching for its self-knowledge and its freedom." 
					
					"Spirit learns by making itself present to itself. It does this by generating a world of knowing. It must first generate this world, or rather series of worlds, before it can know itself in and through that which it has generated, before it can ''wake up" to itself.17" 
					
					"History includes the play of contingency or chance. In revealing itself in time, spirit abandons itself to this play and therefore can neither recon struct its past ( until the final stage) nor predict its future. Spirit does not know where it is going until it gets there; it emerges rather than guides." 
					
					"This is the tragic dimension of spirit's journey and the more precise sense in which, for Hegel, learning is suffering." 
					
					"Finally, the shapes of knowing that embody man's effort to know the divine are also the shapes in which the divine, which is incarnate in man, comes to know itself."

						Hegels model of the spirit 'learning through suffering' seems to me to fit with a lot of eastern ideas of reality, to ultra simplify, that the universe is a sort of great game or learning experience to know every experience there can be. Good and bad, all part of the experience of living. Like "god" finding out what it's like to be all these things, laughing and crying.

							For sure. A lot of parallels. I find it to be the most well elucidated so far (I'm barely getting started with Hegel).

	As a sujbect of a few NDEs, all I can say is I saw black to then wake up with a totally different understanding and perspective on life that I'm still struggling to deal with after many years. 

	Something changed profoundly... happened many times. 

	Each time, "new insights" are acquired. Extremely hard to decipher and interpret as often, the data expressions are totally alien vs current existence in the physical/material plane, where often art is the way chosen to simply ***attempt*** to express and describe what is/was seen during and post experience(s).

	I'm not aware of any evidence of any aspect of life that continues after death, so it doesn't make much sense to me to infer one. I don't believe many people are 100% convinced of either though. 

	I also think there are somewhat sound psychological reasons why people *want* that to be the case, we have no real way to imagine our non existence, and experiencing life is a good thing for most of us, even with the dark times. I have trouble imagining my lack of existence before I was born too.

						There're at least two cases right there, constituting reproduced instances of objectively verified, veridical OBE in cases of clinical death that emergentism cannot explain. 
						
						And Dr Stevenson investigated hundreds if not thousands of cases, not relying on pure self-reports, reproduced and objectively investigated.

						And what about various reproduced, objectively verified instances of PSI research that emergentism presently can't account for?

								You seem to be implying that, in relation to NDE, as opposed to their being some reproduced instances of objectively verified phenomena that breaks the model (which you seem to be dogmatically adhering to, to religious levels), you would only accept such phenomena if it had a majority replication, despite all of the obstacles to this, such as a participants ability to recall things when they are literally, clinically dead; any experience during this state is odd re: emergentist models, but verified OBEs where participants report on phenomena they could not possibly have experienced in line with physicalist models, to any discerning mind, especially one who purports to be scientific, should revise their position, putting the data first, instead of their model. 
								
								
								> So when someone self selects only the remaining portion for study, that is an unacceptable bias and immediately calls into question any result. Where is the study which includes the large portion of patients who report nothing?

								These cases are reported on instead of cases where people don't remember anything because they raise questions that your model presently cannot answer. I would think that would be clear as day. 
								
								
								> Reproducibility is not possible as it would require unethical practices of intentionally putting someone in a near death situation.

								> So no, there is no evidence which meets standard scientific criteria.
								
								
								So, not only are you displaying a concerningly religious selective blindness re: the studies I posted above of a high level of objectively verified and reproduced data set re: PSI, in two separate reviews, you're acknowledging legitimate, unavoidable obstacles re: a particular area of study, requiring different study designs (something uncontroversial in many areas of less disagreed upon empirical study), whilst concurrently then saying that because of that, no evidence is even possible, by your eternally moving goalposts. 
								
								As an evidence-based clinician, lay-philosopher, and science advocate, I find denial of data in favour of a preferred model to be incredibly distasteful in those who purport to be pro science. 
								
								How do you not see that your reasoning above is antithetical to science, and is instead a clear instance of dogmatic adherence to a pre-established position?

										A: By your own definition: objectivity and reproduceable: At least two objectively verified (e.g., not relying on self-reports on their own) instances of verified OBEs, which you continue to offer no explanation for.

	Feels to me like a subset of the dual vs non-dual perspectives.

	A dualist would logically have to conclude that consciousness ends at the moment of death. 

	A non-dualist is harder to pin down, but may logically conclude that \*your experience of consciousness ends at the moment of death, but there is no separate self that \*dies, and the 'real you' is everything. so if everything contains within it, other consciousnesses, you just "wake" to those different experiences.

	Belief in some sort of soul and it‚Äôs attendant afterlife is ancient.  Likely dating far back into pre-history with primitive Animism.   Since most everything had a ‚Äúspirit‚Äù, it‚Äôs generally felt among primitives that after death the spirit goes on to live in the spirit world.

	This was a vastly popular idea since it allowed us to cheat death‚Ä¶. And every religion that came down the pike since incorporated it in one way or another.   

	So, you have millennia of belief in some sort of soul and some sort of afterlife‚Ä¶. Beliefs that are strongly reinforced by many aspects of culture and childhood indoctrination as well.  

	It‚Äôs a matter of comfort to believers‚Ä¶. Unless of course you‚Äôre conditioned by the fear of some sort of horrific afterlife‚Ä¶ and even that doesn‚Äôt seem to be much of a deterrent to bad behavior‚Ä¶..

	But despite millennia of tradition, inculcation, and cultural reinforcement‚Ä¶. There is not a shred of evidence in support.  

	Those of us who believe that death is, in fact, the end‚Ä¶.. Simply accept that as how life works.    Others cling to wishful thinking‚Ä¶.

		This is pretty interesting (among a lot of other stuff): 
		"This documented case study of a physician‚Äôs NDE adds yet one more piece of evidence that highlights the limitation of the materialist perspective, which cannot explain the conscious perception of verified events in the hospital setting during an NDE by a patient while in cardiac arrest with eyes taped shut. Outstanding characteristics of the case include an NDE scale score of 23, indicating a deep NDE and six perceptions during cardiac arrest that were verified by hospital personnel, and which have no physiological explanation."
		
		https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1550830720301117
		
		"ABSTRACT: There are reports of veridical out-of-body experiences (OBEs) and healing occurring during near-death experiences (NDEs). We report a case in which there was strong evidence for both healing and a veridical OBE. The patient‚Äôs experience was thought to have occurred while he was unconscious in an intensive therapy unit (ITU). The patient‚Äôs account of an OBE contained many veridical elements that were corroborated by the medical team attending his medical emergency. He had suffered from a claw hand and hemiplegic gait since birth. After the experience he was able to open his hand and his gait showed a marked improvement."

		It's not enough to put me into 100%, I don't know, but even just not having seen evidence for something doesn't mean one should operate under an assumption for its antithesis; the logical, scientific position would be epistemic humility/agnosticism.

								There is no empirical evidence of people surviving death and experiencing after death, or any evidence of after death in any way for that matter.

									By your definitions, you have created an impenetrable echo chamber for yourself where you will disregard any evidence, as all evidence is gathered in this domain of reality. 
									
									And, re: NDE research, the people studied are considered clinically dead, e.g.: 
									
									-No heartbeat
									
									-No recordable brain activity 
									
									This paper by Oncologist, Dr Jeffrey Long, outlines: "Near-death experiences often occur in association with a cardiac arrest, which means the heart stops beating.21 This condition is popularly known by the phrase ‚Äúheart attack‚Äù. To understand how remarkable it is to have an NDE at a time of clinical death, it is essential to know what happens when the heart stops beating. After the heart stops, blood immediately ceases flowing to the brain. About ten to twenty seconds later, the electroencephalogram (EEG), a measurement of brain electrical activity, is flat.22 At this time there is no significant measurable electrical activity in the cortex, which is the outer part of the brain. Multiple studies show that patients are usually amnesic or confused about events that took place before or after the cardiac arrest. 23,24,25Consequently, almost immediately after cardiac arrest, it should be impossible to have a lucid, organized, and conscious experience. But when a near-death experience occurs, a lucid experience happens even while physical brain function is shut down. The NDERF website has hundreds of examples of NDEs that happened during a cardiac arrest.26 The typical high lucidity in NDEs following cardiac arrest defies any possible medical explanation."

				What about various reproduced, objectively verified instances of PSI research that emergentism presently can't account for that precisely fit the criteria that you just said would make you go: "woah"? 
				
				"This article clarifies the domain of psi, summarizes recent theories from physics and psychology that present psi phenomena as at least plausible, and then provides an overview of recent/updated meta-analyses. The evidence provides cumulative support for the reality of psi, which cannot be readily explained away by the quality of the studies, fraud, selective reporting, experimental or analytical incompetence, or other frequent criticisms. The evidence for psi is comparable to that for established phenomena in psychology and other disciplines, although there is no consensual understanding of them."
				
				https://thothermes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Cardena.pdf
				
				"Using the standards applied to any other area of science, it is concluded that psychic functioning has been well established. The statistical results of the studies examined are far beyond what is expected by chance. Arguments that these results could be due to methodological flaws in the experiments are soundly refuted. Effects of similar magnitude to those found in government-sponsored research at SRI and SAIC have been replicated at a number of laboratories across the world. Such consistency cannot be readily explained by claims of flaws or fraud. (Utts, 1996, p. 3)"

						No. People who share your beliefs and behaviour have consistently demonstrated a weird bias against any data that goes against your unscientific conclusions, and extreme emotional responses to receiving it, that I don't think you're psychologically able to get over somehow; I don't know what's going on with it, but I have hypotheses, and I suspect that you're subject to *the exact same kinds of biases we've seen playing out through history, yet every generation naively thinks that they've somehow, impossibly outgrown: ingroup bias; fear of ostracization; the catch-22 of seeing people who entertain X data as fools - thereby causing you to fear entertaining it as you project your current assumptions of others onto the minds of your colleagues (probably rightly), and fear being perceived similarly; identifying your sense of self with cognitive structures/beliefs in your phenomenological experience, and fearing them dying when they're challenged, as if they're a physical part of you, etc. Nothing new, but the real tragedy being that you erroneously assume by associating with what you think to be science, you have, without having done any great introspection and psychological work on yourselves, you're somehow exempt from the same issues that have plagued humanity throughout history, not understanding how humans work.  
						
						People who share your beliefs and behaviour refuse to acknowledge any information that conflicts with your models on this, and act just as emotionally as other people holding dogmatic beliefs being challenged. 
						
						There is literally no information that would convince people who share your beliefs and behaviour. You have closed your minds. You will eternally move your own goalposts in ways you wouldn't dream of doing in any other field, and even when this is all plain as day, you will refuse to acknowledge, or possibly be capable of acknowledging it.

								I am willing to bet that you wouldn't claim to require such criteria in other areas of empirical research that you readily accept, instead just expecting usual requirements of replication, peer-reviewed journals, etc. and not specific institutional ties.

								Further, given the repeated responses on threads like this, dismissals of any research re: it being "ridiculous" to even consider and the such-like, I expect that this creates concerns of reputation tarnishing, impeding financial and academic *incentives, that prevent such individuals and institutions getting involved in such things precisely for this reason. Why bother going against the grain if it's not financially viable and with so many other financially viable areas of bleeding edge study?

	There's a big difference between 100% convinced, and having faith. Nobody is 100% convinced. Nobody knows, and there's no evidence, so what are they being convinced by? It's just semantics, though. Some people have faith in an afterlife. Some people have faith in no afterlife.

	They can't.

	The limits of our knowledge and perception forbid such certainty.

	I personally have confirmed memories of past lives that are very detailed and traceable to real people.

	But I don't think I can ever be more than 50% certain this wasn't the result of intellect and imagination combining under great stress. Maybe I didn't get blown up in France in 1915 after all. Maybe death really is the end. By all material measures I can't account for any mechanism by which one reincarnates and I can't tell you what consciousness actually is with perfect certainty.

	People tend to be overly confident in what they know. The hardest thing to say and the hardest answer to accept for a lot of people seems to be "I don't know."

	Reality is usually independent of what you believe, so i dont know why you think that would imply some people having souls and some not based on their beliefs. For instance, do you believe the claims of people in mental health hospitals who believe whole heartedly that they have miraculous powers over reality based on their conviction?

	consciousness is a vague term and people mean different things about it. there are many arguably coherent perspectives by which both propositions may be considered true by the same person. 

	if we are talking about consciousness in the sense of one‚Äôs own basic living awareness, or whether we mean it in a more complex cluster of further attributes complicates things even further. 

	and a persons conviction does not entail that conviction is grounded in some broader reality im not really sure what you‚Äôre getting at when you say that. 

	consider also 2 different means of understanding consciousness:

	1. as an individual 

	2. as a universal

	i myself believe that the consciousness of 1 ends at death but that the consciousness of 2 is minimally coeternal with all times individual consciousness exists. in the sense of 2 this consciousness persists after death. and incidentally feel convinced that 1 is actually 2. many people believe this and most sophisticated systems of theology do as well

	I know that science shows that consciousness dies with the brain, but we have to consider the limits of science. I base my beliefs off of what science has proved so far, but maybe measuring a step beyond consciousness is unfathomable at this point. Just think about the time we‚Äôve been able to really look into the brain compared to human existence. We‚Äôve really only had the technology to study consciousness in the brain for the last 50ish years. My point is that people shouldn‚Äôt be so quick to shut down these conversations because of what science has proved to be true so far. My fundamental beliefs are based off of evidence (science) but I also think there are aspects to our existence that we can‚Äôt even comprehend with our current knowledge base.

Probably not but there's just nothing to suggest they are besides fantasy.  It's the exact same thing for anyone who doesn't believe in souls or an afterlife.  

	I also wouldn't say that people who believe in that stuff do it with 100% certainty.  They just believe in them without any empirical basis.  How much that matters to any person will depend on their personal worldview.

	There is undeniable evidence that consciousness is negatively impacted by either disease or injury to the brain.

	Seems pretty obvious why the latter would be the defacto conclusion.

	The idea of an eternal soul is indistingushable from wishful thinking, routed in nothing and easily explainable as a coping mechanism to deal with the fear of death.

	As far as being 100% convinved of anything, there should always be room to be open to possibilities, without illusions.

						My experience is that people who comment as you have will almost always if not ALWAYS move the goalposts, providing post-hoc-rationalisations/ad-hoc hypotheses to everything that's provided, instead of doing what you'd do in a less controversial field of acknowledging the empirical data, not realising that you are trapped in your own conclusions and echo chambers.

										I provided 3 links as a preliminary justification for defining criteria before proceeding in discussion on this topic, based on precedent noted in peer-reviewed journals. Again, that's not the evidence. 
										
										This started by you saying: "There is absolutely zero evidence of consciousness surviving death."
