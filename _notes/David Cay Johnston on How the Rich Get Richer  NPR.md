Investigative reporter David Cay Johnston explores in his new book how in recent years, government subsidies and new regulations have quietly funneled money from the poor and the middle class to the rich and politically connected.

Cay Johnston covers tax policy for _The New York Times_, where he won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on that beat. His previous book, _Perfectly Legal: The Covert Campaign to Rig Our Tax System to Benefit the Super Rich â€” and Cheat Everybody Else_, was a best seller.

The new book, which expands the inquiry beyond tax policy into a whole range of regulatory machinery, is titled _Free Lunch: How the Wealthiest Americans Enrich Themselves at Government Expense (and Stick You With the Bill)_.
