## Why has there not been a once in a generation huge organized protest in America demanding things such as: better minimum livable wages, lower healthcare costs, student loan forgiveness, lower housing costs, better mental health services or anything else?

			“Media keeps us divided” 
			
			I don’t know if you’ve ever done leftist organizing before, but they tend to stay divided no matter what the media does. 
			
			Right wing tendency is to coalesce, Left wing tendency is to factionalize. 
			
			Add in the left’s embrace of idpol and of academic jargon, and it often becomes absolutely intolerable for working class people, even when it speaks (or claims to) for the left.

		U.S. wealth distribution Q3 2023
		
		Published by Statista Research Department, Dec 20, 2023
		
		 In the third quarter of 2023, 66.6 percent of the total wealth in the United States was owned by the top 10 percent of earners. In comparison, the lowest 50 percent of earners only owned 2.6 percent of the total wealth.
		
		Income inequality in the U.S.
		
		Despite the idea that the United States is a country where hard work and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps will inevitably lead to success, this is often not the case. In 2021, 9.3 percent of U.S. households had an annual income under 15,000 U.S. dollars. With such a small percentage of people in the United States owning such a vast majority of the country’s wealth, the gap between the rich and poor in America remains stark.
		
		The top one percent
		
		The United States follows closely behind China as the country with the most billionaires in the world. Elon Musk alone held around 219 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. Over the past 50 years, the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio has exploded, causing the gap between rich and poor to grow, with some economists theorizing that this gap is the largest it has been since right before the Great Depression

					And before anyone hops on me I have lived in Japan and around Europe. I want universal healthcare and more of the gaps in the social net to be filled. But the average American is much wealthier than even their European counterparts, and we could have even a European-style welfare state and that would still be true.

					Ignorance. They have no idea what life was like in somewhere like Burma, or where they live but 50 years ago. They’ve identified some things about their current situation that aren’t perfect and convinced themselves that they are suffering the torments of Hell, rather than enjoying a lifestyle that most of humanity for most of history would kill for.
					
					Did you see the idea doing the rounds on Reddit recently that medieval peasants had it better than us, because (according to the theory) with all of the holy days and holidays they worked less than we do. Kind of missing the point that a peasant farmer works from sun up to sun down, and has to WORK hard, not just “don’t get fired” levels of work, or there’s no crop and they starve. Not just no avocado on toast, but no food at all. And once you finish work, you go back to the hovel which you share with three generations of your family and your farm animals, and which does not have Netflix. Or in fact any television at all, nor any internet access because it’s a few centuries before Al Gore will invent the information superhighway.  But hey, sit there typing on a smartphone that cost hundreds of dollars about how people who owned one change of clothes and maybe their farm tools had life better than you do…

I grew up poor AF, my mom died homeless and penniless, I worked at Target and was a part time stripper while attending college full time. I handed in homework with tear stains because I was exhausted lol. But people still try to convince *me* that I just got lucky from privilege. They used to make me mad but now I just pity them.

					The whole privilege thing is completely asinine. 
					
					And it’s become a ridiculous ideology I call the totem pole of privilege because these people rank you based on how many minority (wealth, race, beauty, past experiences, mental illness) boxes you can check off with some ranked lower than others. 
					
					For example, a conversation I had with one of these people: 
					
					Me: “I’m gay and its caused some poor life experiences that I’m working past to live life better. I graduated college recently, got a good paying job, and have a core group of friends now” 
					
					Other guy: “Oh but you’re a *white* gay. You have no idea what it’s really like. I’m *black* and gay so I’ve had it far worse. You are privileged.”
					
					I just ended the conversation at that point because these privilege obsessed people are so tiring to deal with. They can’t get over their own victim complex and stay stuck where they are.

		Some of it is also kind of hard to control. Even in places with very strong social safety nets (Australia, the UK, Canada, etc.), housing prices can still be very high depending on the state of the economy. 
		
		A lot of these issues are also very massive and difficult to articulate. For instance, better mental health care - what exactly would we be demanding? Less expensive? Better wages for social service workers? More mental health amenities in the workplace? All of these could lead to better mental healthcare, but when you're organizing for a specific purpose, you can't just mobilize for "better mental healthcare." I'm a liberal, but that's one of the major issues I've observed on the left (especially in comparison to other countries). When we do get massive movements together - like Occupy Wall Street - we kind of lack a specific, cohesive strategy. It tends to get very idea-y very quickly.

Yes the bottom 25% are struggling, but the majority of people are doing well and happy and unfortunately they aren’t going to bite the hand that feeds them and disrupt their current status to help those below them.
		
		Even prior to the Trump/Clinton election it was something like 75% of Americans liked their current healthcare insurance - more Republicans but even Democrats were at least 50/50 saying they were happy with their health insurance.

			I was never more broke than when I was 18-24 years old, and everyone I knew was super broke when they were young. (Back in the 90s) It feels a bit like young people are (shocker) a bit impatient. Straight out of college they're asking, "Why am I not middle class yet?"

			I have long held a theory that those in charge have really figured out the perfect level to keep the masses at. Just enough to where people are comfortable enough to be complacent and not want to risk what they have by changing the status quo. Like of course if we all united, in whatever means are necessary, things could get better. But most people don’t want to put in the effort and risk loosing what they are comfortable with.

		It goes far beyond simply not being united.
		
		Americans are quite obviously purposefully divided, likely with express intent to prevent them from taking the actions OP mentions.
		
		The fact is, at one point, the American economy relied heavily on literal slavery.  That truth allows us to view America's subsequent economic path through that lens.  Meaning, as an effort to perfect 'slavery-lite': find just the right balance where the owner class *absolutely maximizes exploitation*, without causing complete uprising.
		
		To be clear, this is only one framework for interpreting things, and it may not be true in all cases.  But it may provide insight in other instances.
		
		So, we can't have unions, because people are convinced unions are out of control, and they inevitably lead to demands and regulations that kill businesses, and eventually kill their own jobs.  And that might be true.  I don't actually know enough about this specific topic, but it would be awfully convenient if the business owners helped ensure it was true...
		
		And we can't have cheap healthcare, or free/cheap college (even though it did exist, and my parents probably benefited from it, but eventually voted against it), because that's socialism.  And I don't know what socialism is, but Nazi's were socialist.  And so is China, and Russia, and some of the icky South American countries.  So it's obviously super bad.
		
		Also, Obamacare will literally execute your grandma, so shame on you and Obama.
		
		And can you sit there with a straight face and tell me I should worry about the minimum wage, when liberals are taking the sexy out of M&amp;Ms?  How can I focus on any of that when wokeness is coming to take my pride and dignity from my cold, diabetic hands?
		
		And I really don't mean to alarm you here, but liberals have been waging a literal war on Christmas for decades now.  Haven't you heard? I mean, truthfully, what's more important to you, ensuring your government provides you basic human rights and needs?  Or, keeping CHRIST in Christmas?
		
		I don't know the answer either way, I'm just comforted knowing we're keeping *unfettered and unashamed corporate sponsorship* in our holidays.  All year, I look forward to my Allstate Family Christmas Breakfast.  Then I take my family on our annual Goodyear Drive to Chick-fil-A Church Hour.  Then we return to our Capital One Tree, where finally, the bowels of our great economy bathe us in their loads of wrapped gifts.
		
		Sorry, what was the question again?

				The difference is the Tea Party actually got people elected.
				
				I remember Roger Ebert of all people writing about his disillusionment with Occupy and compared it to the relative success of the Tea Party. He wrote  something along the lines of: the Tea Party asked people to attend protests, vote for certain candidates, but at the end of the day *go home*. It gave them tangible goals that anyone anywhere could fit into their lives to help the movement. Occupy never seemed interested in reaching out. The whole thing began to feel performative and the only way to take part was to basically upend your whole life. If you were from a mid-sized city in Iowa there were ways for you to be involved in the Tea Party beyond just “send money”. Occupy never seemed to have that kind of road map.

* 🟩 **[Mr_MegaAfroMan](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr_MegaAfroMan)** ⬆️ 15 _(2024-01-08 22:53:20)_

	There are a few points brought up very eloquently in the comments here. A summary as I see it:

	1. America is huge. Like seriously. America is the size of continental Europe and it's population is arguably more comparable to the Entire EU than to any one country within it.  Something people often forget, especially here on reddit it seems, is a significant population of the US is more Suburban or Rural than true urbanites. Like really go look up the 10 largest cities, add up their metro area populations (which is overly generous as some definitions of New York metro area basically includes all of New Jersey as well as a significant chunk of the North East) and you'll find that some 60% or more of the population simply isn't accounted for there. States like Alabama, Colorado, Kentucky, Louisiana and on, do not have any cities over 1 million people, yet they still have 5 million or more total population in each state.

	As such economic realities will vary, sometimes dramatically. As well as coordinating mass demonstrations becomes difficult given the distances and different local situations. 

	2. America is diverse. America has a very diverse cultural, economic, and political make up along with a short history compared to many European nations where oppression existed as the status quo for literally a thousand years. As such getting any large unified group to even align on something is difficult. I know it seems sometimes like obviously every republican is a greedy boomer or religious zealot or that every liberal is a freeloading SJW, but almost all of them are legitimately real people, with inner lives and thought processes just as complex as your own. Sometimes they just express it poorly as we've grown to view disagreement as opposition. 

	Why would I waste my time giving a reasonable dissertation to someone I truly believe is genuinely just dangerously stupid or malicious?

	3. America, on the grand global and historical scheme, isn't actually that bad. Most* Americans live better than the rich did almost anywhere 200 years ago. Most* Americans live better than entire populations of 3rd world countries. 

	Like, yeah. It sucks being ruined by one mistake or unlucky event. It sucks clawing and fighting just to do as well as we perceive our relatives, and ancestors did with seemingly less effort or hardship. Yeah Healthcare is bullshit, and nobody should be required to work more than 40 hours a week just to scrape by.  But the reality of the world is, in some places it is still very normal to live with your extended family in buildings with only one or two rooms. Working literally all day, 6 or 7 days a week and building absolutely zero generational wealth. Most* Americans have it better than that, while it doesn't diminish their struggles, it is harder to motivate radical action when the problems are literally first world problems. 

	4. Those who have, do not want to lose. This is borderline conspiratorial. However there definitely is some demonstrable truth that the system is built in a way that those who look out for themselves can get ahead, and once you get ahead it is easier to stay ahead and continue accumulating wealth. Not every political action, is playing into this. Sometimes people do genuinely have different reasoning for supporting something than you can envision. But sometimes there are large paychecks waiting to be cashed by those willing to push things through. 

	5. The problems and proposed solutions are, frankly, not always fleshed out. There is a lot of debate to be had about ways to make the numbers work, but just as a back-of-the-napkin calculation the mean personal income for 2022 was 54K per person per year. That is 40 hours a week at about 25 dollars per hour. That's a take home of 44K a year. 3500 dollars a month for all your bills after health insurance deductions and retirement savings. In some areas this is very good and in dual income households this would escalate them to new financial possibilities. In others this would be very bad, and barely cover rent and expenses. Obviously some things will adjust as traditional welfare will no longer be necessary, however a different form of welfare to help those in high cost of living areas may need to be established. 

	Tl;dr: Man, revolutions a lot of work for not a lot of potential benefit in the grand scheme.

I think sometimes people outside our country really don’t understand just how diverse and vast our country is, you have so many people from many different backgrounds and cultures that affect how they think and view issues, it’s hard and almost near impossible to get everyone on board with some of these issues. But this diversity is one of the things that I love about our country though

	Americans are the wealthiest people in the world in all but the lowest 10% of earners, even when accounting for higher cost of living. Even though there's plenty of room for improvement, it's hard to justify protesting when you're in the most privileged group of people on the planet.

For the most part, we are the only ones who have AC as a household common.

If you had decided to boycott or protest university costs prior to going, that would have been change people could get behind. But asking the rest of the country to foot the bill for those loans, which is what is happening, is not a popular idea.

	3. Lower housing prices would mean all of the homeowners in the country would lose net worth. And property tax receipts would plummet.

	My guy, if a mass group of Americans marches *anywhere* country wide, like a full gathering just gaining traction and marching heavily across the nation, that shit’ll look less like a protest, and more like a militant movement. At least to the government, it will. It’d probably lead to some very drastic and aggressive actions from both the protesters, and the Feds. Especially if it were done in Washington or New York. 

	Aside from pure hypotheticals, most folks can’t and don’t agree on these things. We’re incredibly divided on these topics, mostly due to the politicians themselves. More than that, what people say on the internet and what people actually do are very different things. People get angry and pissed off online, but then they simply return to their work, their anger bringing them nothing but the slight validation from others online.

	Also, most people are doing well, despite what the internet says. We *are* America, after all, many people make enough money to live comfortably above the poverty line. And that’s good enough for the government and more so the mass public to believe that no changes need to be made. 

	Truthfully, I believe people just don’t care. You want change? You have to shake up your own life, gotta go long-term protest, which means not working, moving across a city/state. That shit ain’t easy, most people are much more content to shout into the void of Reddit or Twitter about their opinions than they are to take action about what they believe.

Old people, anyone in public sector jobs, pretty much anyone in white collar jobs, Medicaid recipients.  So it is hard to have a cohesive demographic on that one.

	* Student loan forgiveness - this is not well supported by the public.  There is fair support at lower amounts and with income thresholds, but support for straight up forgiveness is less than 30%.  

	* Lower Housing Costs - it is a more recent issue which is now at the federal level but you really need to address the supply side.  You can't have the government meddling in the actual prices directly.

	Because our real Masters have become incredibly good at the "Divide and Conquer" strategy, setting one group against the other, and has bought all the reigns to power.

	This is constantly mentioned and referred to, and a certain portion of the populace realizes this, but cannot gain traction with the others due to the before-mentioned reasons.

	It will take some sort of huge calamity or disaster/event that hits a huge portion of the population to change this, in my opinion.

	And even that may not be enough.

	The USA has HOPELESSLY screwed itself in this regard.

	Remember the Wall Street stuff? Or the oil pipeline stuff?

	Yeah?

	How about the "Storm the Capital" stuff? 

	That's how both sides get marginalized (note that I am not supporting either/or here, just showing examples of uprising/protesting sorts of events, devoid of rhetoric or opinion).

	The Real Masters (very small, exclusive group of incredibly rich and powerful individuals) basically control America lock, stock, and key.

	In the present conditions (with how politically divided we truly are, and how threatened our democracy now is, with the next election really putting it on the line), it's just exhausting to have deal with the bigger picture when we are all desperately trying to put out all these fires, to deal with the actual Arsonists themselves.

	Firehoses of Fuckery, Propaganda, Brainwashing, almost total Media control over content, foreign interest influences, and all the rest add up to a total fracturing of any unity.

	Support anything that attempts to upset/overturn this, and you get branded, hard, and immediately ostracized (probably with the threat of violence in today's environment) by those pulling the strings.

	It's just, on one side, brilliant, really, but on the other, totally horrifying to see the shitshow trainwreck happening, and not be able to really organize against it.

	So this is my way - just call it out.

	Bread and circuses! That’s why. Distraction/entertainment/food/vice usually effs people in the A when it comes to organizing people to take a stand against the government. 

	Rome’s rulers deliberately kept the populace in a complacent and inert state by continually plying them with handouts of free food and lavish, violent shows. 

	This concept is usually expressed in shorthand by the expression “bread and circuses”. 

	People are really distracted, money is stretched thin, inflation at an outrageous high, (already using fiat currency in the first place), and yet there’s this really weird gross culture of celebrity worship. 

	It’s all just a hollow shell of bullshit, distraction and ‘hey be a good wage slave and don’t rock the boat’ attitude. Only, in this case the boat is made of straw and we’re sinking like there’s no tomorrow. Meanwhile people are preoccupied with which celebrity bullshit and buying useless cheap shit and working their lives away, while they eat poisoned food, drink poisoned water, unable to pay for housing and just everyday living.
