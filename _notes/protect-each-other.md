Video Transcript:
	I've gotten to the point where if a politician does anything remotely fashy, I go check
	their donation and campaign records.
	It's all this, Rhonda Santas plans to expel all students from Florida who protest Israel.
	He said, oh that was stupid and then I immediately went to the Googles.
	It's literally to the point where I have opensecrets.org bookmarked on my phone.
	All of our politicians donation records are public information.
	I went to the Googles and saw that Rhonda Santas has been gifted almost $400,000 and counting
	from the Israel lobby.
	Israel literally paid him to do this.
	Johnson, the speaker of the house, the man that singlehandedly made sure that the TikTok
	bill, the Taiwan aid that Ukraine aid in the Israel aid was pushed through in 72 hours
	last week.
	It's literally been swimming in Israel money.
	Israel is sending him money as soon as he passes pro Israel legislation.
	Truly makes you wonder what were our politicians getting away with in 1892 when there was no internet.

Video Transcript:
	The closer an empire is to falling, the more repressive they become to their own people.
	When they no longer can control the world the way they want to,
	the more they are clamping down on the rights of their own people.
	And this is what we're seeing here in the Imperial Court of the US Empire.
	The US Empire is losing its grip on its hegemony all around the world,
	whether it be in West Asia, in Eastern Europe, or in East Asia.
	And this is why they will not tolerate any form of dissent
	as they lose their power internationally.

Video Transcript:
	Do you want to know how many people were arrested on January 6th?
	Like at the actual day of January 6th, how many actual arrests were made on that day?
	The day where they were taking over a federal building, a government building, and they were
	chanting, hang Mike, kill Nancy Pelosi, which are federal crimes, you cannot threaten harm
	against the President or Vice President.
	That is a federal crime.
	Six people were arrested inside the building.
	While yes, arrests have been made since, six people were arrested the day of that occurrence.
	Fourteen were arrested outside, but six were arrested inside the building.
	I am in a city where there were literal Nazis outside of a drag brunch.
	In no police presence, these men were there with a sign that said there will be blood.
	Nobody came.

Video Transcript:
	Do not put umbrellas at the front of your line or your march or your perimeter when a threat is approaching.
	Umbrella is, are your second line. Your front line is going to be anti-kettling tactics and barricades.
	The umbrella, in addition to being an excellent device for not getting wet when it's raining,
	helps against water canons to your gas and pepper bombs.
	But as you've probably seen in a few videos right now, whenever there's a threat approaching your line
	and they have no problem taking your property, they can just snatch the umbrellas out and then make arrests as they see fit.
	Your front lines are going to be anti-kettling barricades that have handles on them.
	So heavy wood, corrugated steel, sheets of plastic like the tops of dumpsters or large trash cans cut in half,
	at least 32 gallons or up. Those brave souls of the front line will be wearing safety goggles and a mask.
	No backpacks, the straps are often used as a handle to yank people forward every line.
	The mayor may not have added a binky in my lia that goes into much further detail about such tactics.
	Stay safe out there.

Video Transcript:
	Listen, I agree with the protesters as much as the next guy, but they shouldn't be disorderly about
	f- of course black lives matter, but property damage, that is too far.
	I'm against the war in Vietnam, but these protests are out of control.
	I mean, they should be allowed to sit at the front of the bus, but these freedom buses are hurting their chances at integral.
	Of course, I'd like the vote as much as any other woman, but destroying works of art, now that's too far.
	These suffragettes are hurting our economy.
	40-hour work weeks and save working conditions? Well, that sounds swell, but these unions are just too. Bye!
