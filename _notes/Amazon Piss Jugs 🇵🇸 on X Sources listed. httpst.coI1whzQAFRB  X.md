Joe Biden: Here’s an additional $37 billion to further overfund the police, plus 100,000 more cops to over police the streets. I call it the “safer America plan” (1994 Crime Bill 2.0). Anyone who tries to criticize it will be labeled unAmerican, just like with my Patriot Act.

exactly. the party of the people is actually a party for the oligarchy, and happily funds their enforcement arm

Seems like a horrible return on investment

biggest most dangerous gang on the planet

And the homicide solve rate has been dropping year after year…

kinda misleading 2% solved for "major" crimes... but 51% solved for homicides more than any other year... but stats only available since 2013. 1/4 get their jobs back... because they were innocent?

One-sided statistics. And fake statistics. Just because you throw some sign out here and expect somebody to believe it don't make it true. Show some numbers on real statistic research papers not a sign that you made up loser

\*By profession, police are #1 in spousal abuse. \*\*Victims must repost this crime to the PD to be counted.
