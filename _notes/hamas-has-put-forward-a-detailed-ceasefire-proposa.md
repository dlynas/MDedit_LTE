## Hamas has put forward a detailed ceasefire proposal that would proceed in three stages of 45 days each, with the goal of ending the Gaza war by the end of the four-and-a-half month period. (UPDATE: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the proposal on Wednesday.)

The Hamas plan is a counterproposal to a U.S.-backed Israeli plan that only promised a temporary lull in the fighting. 

Daniel Levy, a former Israeli peace negotiator, says "the parties are still really quite some distance apart" and warns that without U.S. pressure on Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, there is little chance of a successful ceasefire or overall peace in the region. 

"America is apparently willing to risk being further entangled yet again in Middle East wars because it is unwilling to stare down an Israeli leader â€¦ who is insistent on maintaining his apartheid regime," says Levy.
