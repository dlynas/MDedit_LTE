## Spare five minutes to learn about the Vietnam Backlash and the ten-year resistance movement that ended the war. There is a lot we can learn from those people. In many ways they are light years ahead of us.

"So I keep mentioning the Vietnam backlash.
Let's actually talk about it because I think it's
monumentally important to what we're doing now
and people no longer know what really happened.
So here's a primer.
It's a long one.
But just watch the goddamn video, please.
Vietnam anti-war movement renowned for its south and
fury was the first mass movement against a war
in American history and one of its great moral crusades.
Yet most Americans recall only enormous protests
in social chaos.
But in fact, the 10 year movement was a complex phenomenon
that evolved strategically as circumstances changed.
And remember, 10 years, 10 years, we're only on month five.
So there were four stages, but I'm only going to touch
on like the first three.
So the first in 1964 and 65 was led by two groups.
Left-wing activists organized into peace groups opposed
to Cold War and American intervention, abroad, and
college students who had come of age during the Southern
Civil Rights Movement and had seen how readily the
government could divert its gaze away from injustice.
When the war expanded in 1965, the fledgling movement
adopted two strategic goals to give activists enough
knowledge about Vietnam and to draw others into action.
Oh, yeah.
And to normalize opposition.
Since many Americans were hesitant to oppose their own
country at a time of war.
And these peace groups educated the public and the press.
The students invented a new way to train activists
through remarkably successful campus teachings that we hear
about.
Public protests were organized to normalize opposition.
Focus on the word normalize.
It's a thing now, forever.
By the end of 1965, this stage had largely succeeded.
Activists gained a deep knowledge of Vietnam and the war
in protests.
While still small, it did normalize opposition despite
accusations that they were un-American.
And seeds of doubt were planted in the press and the public.
But the war only escalated.
In early 1966, troop deployments, American casualties and
draft calls dramatically increased in college students
and their middle class families for whom military service
was not on the agenda took notice.
Because their self-interest triggered a second stage of
the anti-war movement with much bigger and more
numerous protests.
Also throughout 66 and 67 leaders from politics, science,
and academia, entertainment, and business announced their
opposition to the war.
But it took well over a year to get them to speak out.
In the second stage, there's strategic objectives where to
unite various strands of anti-war opposition behind widespread
draft resistance and to build opposition to force a
political end to the war.
Large protests sprang up across the country.
Self-interested draft avoidance evolved into morally driven
draft resistance.
Troop trains were impeded.
Campus protesters blocked access to CIA and military
recruiters.
Clergy members dumped blood on draft records.
And hippy organizers manipulated the media with attention
grabbing stunts.
Racism became a focus when it was revealed that black
soldiers were drafted, assigned to combat units and killed
at rates significantly higher than white soldiers.
And large protests continued.
But few believed they would stop the war.
So activists moved on to widespread civil disobedience,
rejection of mainstream lifestyles, violent clashes with
police, and militant opposition to the government.
Their strategy less coherent than it was in earlier stages.
Was meant to force an end to the war by creating instability,
chaos, and disruption at home.
Loyalty shifted earlier the dominant slogan had been,
hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?
In 1969, it became one side's right, one side's wrong,
victory to the Viet Cong.
The black community was in revolt after dozens of urban
rebellions.
Students were further radicalized by the killings that
can't state in Jackson State, combat soldiers, one in
six of whom were addicted to heroin, were refusing to
fight and bragging, or killing officers who ordered them
into combat.
This part of the Vietnam backlash that certain
interests try to cover up and pretend never happened.
Returning soldiers to, oh my god, shut up.
Returning soldiers formed a Vietnam veterans against the
war.
Organizers distributed anti-war literature at
military bases and helped GI's published anti-war
newsletters.
Draft resistors had inspired the second change of the
movement and the third, it was the GI's that played that role
and with a much angrier edge.
Hang on, I got to wait till this thing passes before I can do
the outro.
Okay, that was just a little introduction to the opening
stages to get the conversational ball rolling, but if you
think that level of fascist pro-war imperialism was the
thing of the past, you haven't been paying attention.
We don't have a draft, but we do have a burgeoning
police state only accountable to a right wing one party
government.
Cop City is being built in Atlanta and tech that is being
field tested in the occupied West Bank is going to
eventually be used on us.
So start studying the Vietnam backlash and channel those
vibes because the more things change, the more they stay
the same.
Isn't life grand and incidentally free Palestine."
