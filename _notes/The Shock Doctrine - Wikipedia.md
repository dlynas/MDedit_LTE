_**The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism**_ is a 2007 book by the Canadian author and social activist [Naomi Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Klein "Naomi Klein"). In the book, Klein argues that [neoliberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberal "Neoliberal") [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market") policies (as advocated by the economist [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman "Milton Friedman")) have risen to prominence in countries and regions such as the United States, the United Kingdom, China, the European Union, and Eastern Europe, because of a deliberate strategy of "[shock therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_therapy_(economics) "Shock therapy (economics)")". This centers on the exploitation of national crises (disasters or upheavals) to establish controversial and questionable policies, while citizens are too distracted (emotionally and physically) to engage and develop an adequate response and resist effectively. The book advances the idea that several man-made events, such as the [Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War "Iraq War"), were undertaken with the intention of pushing through unpopular free market capitalist policies in their wake.

Some reviewers criticized the book for making what they viewed as simplifications of political phenomena, while others lauded it as a compelling and important work. The book served as the main source of a 2009 documentary feature film with the same title directed by [Michael Winterbottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Winterbottom "Michael Winterbottom").<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

## Synopsis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Shock_Doctrine&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Synopsis")\]

The book is divided into seven parts with a total of 21 chapters.

**Part 1** begins with a chapter on psychiatric shock therapy and the covert experiments conducted by the psychiatrist [Ewen Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Ewen_Cameron "Donald Ewen Cameron") in collusion with the [Central Intelligence Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency"). The second chapter introduces Milton Friedman and his [Chicago school of economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics "Chicago school of economics"), whom Klein describes as leading a [laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire "Laissez-faire") capitalist movement committed to creating free markets that are even less regulated than those that existed before the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression").

**Part 2** discusses the use of "shock doctrine" to transform [South American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America") economies in the 1970s, focusing on the [1973 coup in Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1973 Chilean coup d'état") led by General [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet "Augusto Pinochet") and influenced by a prominent group of Chilean economists, known as the [Chicago Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Boys "Chicago Boys"), who had been trained at the University of Chicago in the Economics department, funded by the CIA, and advised by Milton Friedman. Klein connects torture with economic shock therapy.

**Part 3** covers attempts to apply the shock doctrine without the need for extreme violence against sections of the population. Klein says that [Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher "Margaret Thatcher") applied mild shock "therapy" facilitated by the [Falklands War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War "Falklands War"), while [free market reform in Bolivia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Bolivia#History "Economy of Bolivia") was possible due to a combination of pre-existing economic crises and the charisma of [Jeffrey Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs "Jeffrey Sachs").

**Part 4** reports on how Klein thinks the shock doctrine was applied in [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland "Poland"), [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa"), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia"), and the [Four Asian Tigers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Asian_Tigers "Four Asian Tigers"). In Poland she discusses how the left-leaning trade union [Solidarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union) "Solidarity (Polish trade union)") won the country's [1989 legislative elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Polish_legislative_election "1989 Polish legislative election"), but subsequently employed the shock doctrine due to [IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund") pressure. The section on China discusses the [1989 Tiananmen Square Protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Tiananmen_Square_protests "1989 Tiananmen Square protests"), and the liberalization of China's economy. In South Africa she explains that the [negotiations to end apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiations_to_end_apartheid_in_South_Africa "Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa") resulted in economic policy that went against the core of the [Freedom Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Charter "Freedom Charter"). In Russia she describes how [Boris Yeltsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin "Boris Yeltsin") took power after the [collapse of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union") and crafted an economic policy that turned Russia into an [oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy "Oligarchy"). Finally, she says that during the [1997 Asian financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis "1997 Asian financial crisis") the Tiger Nations were forced to sell off numerous state enterprises to private, foreign companies.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-time_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-time-3">[3]</a></sup>

**Part 5** introduces the "Disaster Capitalism Complex", a complex series of networks and influence employed by private companies that allows them to profit from disasters. She mirrors this new Disaster Capitalism Complex with the [Military Industrial Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex "Military–industrial complex") and explains that both employ the blurring of the line between private and public, through tactics like the [revolving door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_door_(politics) "Revolving door (politics)").

**Part 6** discusses the use of "[shock and awe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_and_awe "Shock and awe")" in the [2003 invasion of Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq "2003 invasion of Iraq") and the subsequent [occupation of Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Iraq_(2003%E2%80%932011) "History of Iraq (2003–2011)"), which Klein describes as the most comprehensive and full-scale implementation of the shock doctrine ever attempted, with mass privatization of Iraqi state-owned enterprises (including thousands of men being laid off) which is argued as contributing to the insurgency, since many of the unemployed became embittered toward the US as a result and joined insurgent groups afterward.

**Part 7** is about winners and losers of economic shock therapy – how small groups will often do very well by moving into luxurious [gated communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_communities "Gated communities") while large sections of the population are left with decaying public infrastructure, declining incomes and increased [unemployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment "Unemployment"). Klein describes economic policy after [Hurricane Katrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina "Hurricane Katrina"), the [2004 Sri Lanka Tsunami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_the_2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_on_Sri_Lanka "Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on Sri Lanka"), and the [apartheid-style policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_and_apartheid "Israel and apartheid") of the [Israeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") government toward [Palestinians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians "Palestinians").

The **Conclusion** details the backlash against the "shock doctrine" and economic institutions which, in Klein's view, encourage it – like the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank") and [IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund"). South America and Lebanon post-2006 are shown in a positive light, where politicians are already rolling back free-market policies, with some mention of the increased campaigning by community-minded activists in South Africa and China.

Paul B. Farrell from the _[Dow Jones Business News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_%26_Company "Dow Jones & Company")_ argued that _The Shock Doctrine_ "may be the most important book on economics in the 21st century."<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> In _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")_, [John Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_N._Gray "John N. Gray") hailed it as one of the "very few books that really help us understand the present", describing the work as "both timely and devastating".<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> William S. Kowinski of the _[San Francisco Chronicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle "San Francisco Chronicle")_ praised Klein's prose and wrote that the author "may well have revealed the master narrative of our time."<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> In _[The Irish Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irish_Times "The Irish Times")_, [Tom Clonan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clonan "Tom Clonan") reported that she "systematically and calmly demonstrates to the reader" the way in which [neoconservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservative "Neoconservative") figures were intimately linked to seismic events that "resulted in the loss of millions of lives."<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

In the _[Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times")_, Richard Rayner opined, "Not everybody's going to agree with her, but this is reporting and history-writing in the tradition of [Izzy Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._F._Stone "I. F. Stone") and [Upton Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair "Upton Sinclair"). Klein upends assumptions and demands that we think – her book is thrilling, troubling and very dark."<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> [Stephen Amidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Amidon "Stephen Amidon") of the _[New York Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Observer "New York Observer")_ affirmed the applicability of Klein's thesis to the [Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War "Iraq War") and argued, "Seen through the lens of Naomi Klein's analysis, \[it\] makes horrifying sense, right down to Mr. Rumsfeld's decision to allow the looting of the nation's cultural identity."<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Shashi Tharoor noted the work's "meticulous endnotes" and stated, referring to [globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization "Globalization"), that Klein "has established herself as its principal naysayer."<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Katy Guest of _[The Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent "The Independent")_ praised the book as "a compelling account of the way big business and politics use global disasters for their own ends."<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> [Juan Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Manuel_Santos "Juan Manuel Santos"), winner of the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize, called the book "as gripping as the best murder mystery, as well researched as the best investigative journalism – on a par with the work of a [Seymour Hersh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Hersh "Seymour Hersh")."<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

_The Shock Doctrine_ was named one of the best books of 2007 by the _[Village Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_Voice "Village Voice")_,<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> _[Publishers Weekly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishers_Weekly "Publishers Weekly")_,<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> _[The Observer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Observer "The Observer")_,<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> and the _[Seattle Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Times "Seattle Times")_.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> In 2019, _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")_ ranked it the 18th greatest book since 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

### Mixed\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Shock_Doctrine&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Mixed")\]

The [Nobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences "Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences") Laureate and former [Chief Economist of the World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Chief_Economist "World Bank Chief Economist") [Joseph Stiglitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz "Joseph Stiglitz") wrote a review of _The Shock Doctrine_ for _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_ calling the parallel between economic shock therapy and the psychological experiments conducted by Ewen Cameron "overdramatic and unconvincing" and claiming that "Klein is not an academic and cannot be judged as one. There are many places in her book where she oversimplifies." He also said, "the case against these policies is even stronger than the one Klein makes" and that the book contains "a rich description of the political machinations required to force unsavory economic policies on resisting countries."<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> [Shashi Tharoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashi_Tharoor "Shashi Tharoor") in _[The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")_ says that _The Shock Doctrine_ takes Klein's criticism of capitalism an important step further. He also said Klein "is too ready to see conspiracies where others might discern little more than the all-too-human pattern of chaos and confusion, good intentions and [greed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greed "Greed")."<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

Sociologists as [Ulrich Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrich_Beck "Ulrich Beck") envisioned the society of risk as a new cultural value which posed risk as a [commodity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity "Commodity") to be exchanged in globalized economies. As Klein observed, this suggested that disasters and [capitalist economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_economy "Capitalist economy") was inevitably entwined.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Some voices have praised the contributions of Klein to the study of the "spectacle of disasters".

### Unfavourable\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Shock_Doctrine&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Unfavourable")\]

In the _[London Review of Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Review_of_Books "London Review of Books")_, Stephen Holmes criticizes _The Shock Doctrine_ as naïve, and opines that it conflates "'free market orthodoxy' with predatory corporate behaviour."<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> John Willman of the _[Financial Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times "Financial Times")_ describes it as "a deeply flawed work that blends together disparate phenomena to create a beguiling – but ultimately dishonest – argument."<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Tom Redburn in _The New York Times_ states that "what she is most blind to is the necessary role of [entrepreneurial capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurial_capitalism "Entrepreneurial capitalism") in overcoming the inherent tendency of any established [social system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_system "Social system") to lapse into stagnation."<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

[Jonathan Chait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Chait "Jonathan Chait") wrote in _[The New Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic "The New Republic")_ that Klein "pays shockingly (but, given her premises, unsurprisingly) little attention to [right-wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing "Right-wing") ideas. She recognizes that [neoconservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism "Neoconservatism") sits at the heart of the [Iraq war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_war "Iraq war") project, but she does not seem to know what neoconservatism is; and she makes no effort to find out."<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Robert Cole from _[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times "The Times")_ said, "Klein derides the 'disaster capitalism complex' and the profits and [privatisations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatisation "Privatisation") that go with it but she does not supply a cogently argued critique of free market principles, and without this _The Shock Doctrine_ descends into a muddle of stories that are often worrying, sometimes interesting, and occasionally bizarre."<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>

Economist [Tyler Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Cowen "Tyler Cowen"), who called Klein's arguments "ridiculous" and the book a "true economics disaster", wrote on _[The New York Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Sun "The New York Sun")_ that the book contains "a series of fabricated claims, such as the suggestion that [Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher "Margaret Thatcher") created the [Falkland Islands crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_invasion_of_the_Falkland_Islands "1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands") to crush the unions and foist unfettered capitalism upon an unwilling British public."<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> [Johan Norberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Norberg "Johan Norberg") of the libertarian [Cato Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute "Cato Institute") criticizes the book, saying that "Klein's analysis is hopelessly flawed at virtually every level." Norberg finds fault with specifics of the analysis, such as with the Chinese government crackdown on the [Tiananmen Square protests of 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989 "Tiananmen Square protests of 1989"). He argues that, rather than crushing opposition to pro-market reforms (as Klein would have it), the crackdown itself caused liberalization to stall for years.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Klein responded on her website to both Norberg and Chait, stating that both had misrepresented her positions. Klein wrote that Norberg had erected a [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man "Straw man") by claiming that her book is about one man, Friedman, but that it is in fact about a "multifaceted ideological trend".<sup id="cite_ref-Klein1Year_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-Klein1Year-28">[28]</a></sup> Norberg again responded that Klein "actually defends only one of her central claims that I criticized. Instead, she gives the impression that I have just tried to find small mistakes here and there in her book." He went on to say that the numbers Klein supplied in her reply reveal the statistics in her central argument to be "rubbish".<sup id="cite_ref-Norberg3Days_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-Norberg3Days-29">[29]</a></sup>

In a piece related to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"), Klein wrote in 2020 that a "Pandemic Shock Doctrine" was beginning to emerge and called it the "Screen New Deal".<sup id="cite_ref-ti-20200508_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine#cite_note-ti-20200508-30">[30]</a></sup>
