			Someone before in a post was talking about the news and their scare tactics for previous generations about acid rain and other things/issues. As someone pointed out it wasn't scare tactics it was this will happen if we don't change and laws and people changed and we fixed the issues. We have to be loud and keep pushing to get change.

Elon Musk is flying nearly 200,000 miles a year in his private jet while emiting 5kg of CO2 per mile. It is like he is intentionally trying his hardest to undo every pound of CO2 that his electric cars offset. It really hammers home the bitter truth that ethical consumption simply does not exist under capitalism and it never will.

			Why would I ever expect rich humans to act reasonably?
			
			We're talking about an animal here. You give an animal unlimited access to resources with zero checks, they aren't going to act responsibly. 
			
			We are never going to convince billionaires (or most modern politicians for that matter) to start being considerate for others.
			
			By definition they cannot. Theyre dragons.

			* 🟦 **[DecentIdeasOverHere](https://www.reddit.com/user/DecentIdeasOverHere)** ⬆️ 15 _(2024-02-24 11:02:22)_

				Billionaires are a *diseased* animal; not all humans would act that way…
				
				> give an animal unlimited access to resources with zero checks
				
				That’s not the actual scenario, tho, right? 1) “Self-made” billionaires/mega rich people don’t just wake up one morning and randomly have unlimited access to resources. They actively set out to acquire these resources, and pathologically hoard them. 2) There are checks, both from institutions/government, and socially/culturally. But again, these people pathologically ignore or fight to (successfully) remove them…
				
				What you’re describing is just the children of said people. There, you see more of a mix of responsible behaviors, I’d say. And those that want to continue the wealth growing/hoarding tend to do a poorer job of it than the original amasser.
				
				….and I totally agree they cannot be convinced to care for others. They are to be eaten.

				* 🟪 **[kunbish](https://www.reddit.com/user/kunbish)** ⬆️ 6 _(2024-02-24 11:33:00)_

					I described current reality (billionaires exists), not the whole process of how billionaires become billionaires.
					
					And I think its a super interesting question to ask whether any of us would act differently if we had all the money. 
					
					My personal belief is that people are lazy. We don't tend to change unless we have to. We don't tend to respect threats until we are punished or forsee an obvious consequence. Basically we're smart but not always wise; we jump just high enough to reach the grape. No higher.
					
					For my part, I care about others as a result of having been told off a few times. Teenage me had to hurt a few feelings and get his feelings hurt quite a bit; and then had to work several dead-end jobs; had to consistently walk and bike everywhere, had to struggle; and still had to do a bunch of research out of pure random interest in order to arrive at a place I would call "reasonably compassionate".
					
					With that in mind, being rich would mean that regardless of how morally upstanding and kind your soul might be, you do not face the same incentives and pressures that regular people do.
					
					So while we can agree that your ultra-entreprenur to the death is the absolute worst, I do not think that their kids are very far behind them. Hell the fact that there are so many more trust fund kids than Musks might hint at them being a bigger statistical issue.
					
					I think that no man can carry the One True Ring. Takes a hobbit.

					* 🟥 **[DecentIdeasOverHere](https://www.reddit.com/user/DecentIdeasOverHere)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-24 12:43:43)_

						I think a lot of us would act differently if we had all the money. But i tend to think it’s more a “money doesn’t change your character, it reveals it” kind of thing. A man who dutifully comes home to his wife every night might take on 904 wives if he had all the money. He didn’t change, but his behavior did because now he can afford more wives. … But as for me, if I had Musk money, I wouldn’t build rockets to start a space travel business, or all that other narcissistic dumb sht—because I’m not a love-starved narcissist. 
						
						> We tend to….obvious consequence.
						
						I agree with that assessment, but not the line before it. Just in that I don’t think that’s laziness. That’s just humans/animals being conditioned to our environment. If my two lowest Maslow level of needs are being met in my current circumstance, why would I change things? Change is dangerous…or scary, especially if that third level is not secure/reliable. From an evolutionary/physiological perspective, jumping just high enough to reach the grape make sense: why spend precious calories on extra effort? Why jump higher than necessary and risk a greater injury in the return to earth?
						
						Yes, you are a good, regular human lol! Isn’t that how we all learn how to be socially accepted in our groups? Now, the dead-end jobs and financial struggle part…that’s capitalism’s fault and not really necessary as a human experience, but adversity more generally is pretty natural/universal. And trust fund kids may have it, too—it just springs from issues further up the Maslow pyramid 😒
						
						That’s actually an interesting question and wonder if yo[u/anyone](https://www.reddit.com/user/anyone) has any data on it: how much wealth is tied up in/has been disbursed by trust funds? I would agree that our likely most-positive path out of our current state will be determined by what happened with that collective mass of resources/the choices those people make.

					Gotta clarify one thing.
					
					Emissions are one facet of an enormous issue that I call ecocide.
					
					In the case of animal ag, the real problem is the deforestation and pesticide/herbicide use; not to mention its relative inefficiency in terms of caloric production compared to most veg farming.
					
					Similar issue to say, suburbs. They take up way more space than they need to and provide way less than other options for the space. And demand is unsustainably high. Some people do eat steak every day. There are people switching over to *meat only* diets right now, dumb as it is.

		I think it's a fool's errand to pretend this is apolitical. Capitalism is the primary force depending on and encouraging hyper-consumption. It also has a huge influence on our politics, laws, and regulations. It's naive to act like we can make changes as individuals. Collective action and political change is necessary.

	I respectfully disagree. I think as a planet we have just about already reached peak CO2 emissions and are coming down. I do agree that legislation should chase after the worst offenders and curtail the use of private jets.

	But in general, I think if you can lead by example and show that you can be happy and healthy in a smaller consumption life and feel fulfilled, I think you'll have a bigger impact than you think as your lifestyle will rub off on others.

	I think using legislative pressure + smarter consumer choices we can cut back on overall consumption, but where we do consume it'd be great to de-petroleum the packaging and shipping of consumables products. I think CO2 is easier to fix than we think while micro plastics in the soil and water is harder to fix than we think and we need to be ramping cellulose and bioplastics and shutting down petroleum as as hard as we can. Just my two cents but I feel positive in general. Plus just have fewer kids, that'll help too.

	I really believe that trying to get meaning in life through wealth signification and consumption is harmful to the person doing it on some level, though. Of course, you've mentioned insanely rich people who don't seem like they do very much self-reflection, but if I jettisoned my values in this area, I'd be hurting myself in the end, as well. I know a counterpoint could be "It's socially accepted and normal to consume rabidly and see that as a reflection of success" but, outside of something like owning a house (something I'll probably never be able to do, anyway), I don't relate to that, can't justify it, and feel any time I have an existential crisis as though that mentality is harmful. I don't think it does good things to people for them to constantly be thinking "What's the next thing I can own to show people I'm successful, beautiful, wealthy, organised, smart, etc?"

	 I also feel like, no matter what other people do, I want to try to do what I know is right. The impact of that isn't always measurable (probably rarely measurable), nor is it smooth sailing, but I want to know that I'm trying to do what I see as the right thing to do, even if other people (people who have the ability and desire to consume objects and resources in an extravagant way) refuse to do anything. Also, I think it's normal and logical to be mad about the fact that they refuse to do anything, so I understand your feelings on one level, but I'm not going to appeal to futility as a result.

							> "And that means nihilists find zero meaning in anything?"
							
							Yes, traditionally nihilists believe meaning is completely impossible. 
							
							> "How could one function in that state?"
							
							Nihilists are often quite miserable. It would seem, roughly, that even an absurd or hopeless pursuit of meaning has some benefits to a cheerful affect.
							
							Basically, few people are scholarly, dedicated *nihilists* for long. Finding meaning in pleasure is called hedonism (or utilitarianism, depending on how you define "pleasure") - a moral ethics that postulates you forge meaning in a definition you create/discover is called existentialism.
							
							As to your first question, formal existentialism is built on/reacting to earlier nihilist writings. However, it isn't really accurate to call existentialist thinking an "offshoot," nor necessarily fair to compare them as roughshod as I did earlier.
							
							Anyway this is a topic I find fascinating so please let me know if you have any other questions.

								Man I need some formal education in philosophy this stuff is awesome
								
								Nihilism does make more sense as a transitionary thing, that puts it into context. So are there rules for self-identifying as a "true" nihilist? Like is there a criteria laid out?
								
								Cause my first thought was "language is an abstact concept" and "math is an abstract concept" and my name, and the concept of meaning itself and the word nihilism are all "meaningful" in a sense. Language literally exists to express meaning lol
								
								Maybe I'm being too literal or pedantic

									> "So are there rules for self-identifying as a "true" nihilist?"
									
									Moreso the word has meaning in philosophy.
									
									Nietzsche is often cited as a nihilist, primarily his assertion in *Thus Spake Zarathustra*, "God is dead" where he casts doubt on traditional structures of meaning (at that point largely rooted in religion).
									
									In my opinion Nietzsche's work shows reverence to some concepts of meaning, which excludes him as a nihilist. In his book *Birth of Tragedy*, he talks about multiple foundations of meaning. The twin gods of human endeavor - Apollo and Dionysus - provide two paths to meaning that a nihilist (as strict as we're being here) wouldn't recognize.
									
									I also believe Schopenhauer was an infamously dour writer and is tributed with the title "nihilist" but I haven't read his work.
									
									> "the concept of meaning itself and the word nihilism are all 'meaningful' in a sense."
									
									I'm also inclined to believe this. A nihilist might argue that, no, words don't have meaning but the *impression* of meaning. That what *feels* like communication isn't really, then they might drill down on language until they hit Socratic bedrock where you do, ultimately, have to confess the only thing you know for sure is nothing.
									
									Or they might kick your shins and wander off, depending on the sincerity of their nihilism.
									
									> "How would you describe your personal philosophy?"
									
									In terms of meaning I'm a phenomenologist. I am confident there is meaning because I've experienced it as qualia in my perception.

								I read a post of yours talking about the cycle of morality:  essentially nihilism -> hedonism -> utilitarianism -> existentialism -> (potentially back to nihilism).
								
								It really broadened my perspective, so I browsed some of your post history. Do you have any good book suggestions to further broaden my perspective on this cycle/philosophy as a whole so to speak, or maybe other suggested readings. I saw you suggested Hume to this commenter - I will look into him; but to start, I think I need some groundwork.
								
								Thanks for the thought provoking posts!
								
								Edit: Sorry, out of eagerness, I think I jumped the gun on this reply to you. I am currently browsing phenomenology and many of these topics of the Stanford Encyclopedia, and I'm sure I can find more information. Thank you though for piquing my curiosity. It seems I need to move on from studying eastern thought and psychology and take a deep dive into philosophy - specifically the refutation of nihilism.

								* ⬜️ **[ledfox](https://www.reddit.com/user/ledfox)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-03-05 08:05:02)_

									Wow thanks. I recommended Hume because he is ground-work. He's accessible and his ideas are important. Specifically "An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding" - he covers a lot and with very breezy language.
									
									The "cycle" that folks tend to move through as they explore ethics is a meta-ethics observation. For details on that, I highly recommend Sartre's "Existentialism is a Humanism." It's a bit more advanced than Hume, but this work of Sartre is far from the most esoteric of tomes I could mention. Sartre (and existentialists in general) talk a *lot* about the formation of ethics. 
									
									Those two should get you started. Enjoy!
