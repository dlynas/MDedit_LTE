## We are currently millions to feel powerless witnessing from afar the genocide currently unfolding against Palestinians of Gaza. Fighting this powerlessness means organizing for tomorrow to support, at our own scale, the Palestinian struggle for liberation. In order to do so, we need to be useful where we can.

For you, architecture students, this may mean understanding the geography and architecture of Israeli settler colonialism in Palestine to then be able to act upon this understanding. This is why we are proposing a teach-in by The Funambulist editor-in-chief LÃ©opold Lambert, who will introduce the various architectural embodiments of settler colonialism in Palestine.

November 11, 2023
6PM Paris time*

(*make sure to double-check your time zone in case we did a mistake in the following hours
(cf. daylight savings, etc.))

PS: Although we welcome everyone with interest in spatial politics, please note that this teach-in is tailored for architecture students.
