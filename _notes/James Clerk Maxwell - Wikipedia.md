[Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations") for electromagnetism have been called the "[second great unification in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(physics)#Unification_of_magnetism,_electricity,_light_and_related_radiation "Unification (physics)")"<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> where [the first one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(physics)#Unification_of_gravity_and_astronomy "Unification (physics)") had been realised by [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton").

With the publication of "[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field "A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field")" in 1865, Maxwell demonstrated that [electric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_force "Electric force") and [magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") travel through space as [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave") moving at the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"). He proposed that light is an undulation in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.<sup id="cite_ref-ADTEF_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-ADTEF-4">[4]</a></sup> The unification of light and electrical phenomena led to his prediction of the existence of [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave "Radio wave"). Maxwell is also regarded as a founder of the modern field of [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering").<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

Maxwell was the first to derive the [Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution "Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution"), a statistical means of describing aspects of the [kinetic theory of gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases "Kinetic theory of gases"), which he worked on sporadically throughout his career.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> He is also known for presenting the first durable [colour photograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_photograph "Colour photograph") in 1861 and for his foundational work on analysing the [rigidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_rigidity "Structural rigidity") of rod-and-joint frameworks ([trusses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truss "Truss")) like those in many bridges. He is responsible for modern [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis").<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Maxwell is also recognized for laying the groundwork for [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory").<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

His discoveries helped usher in the era of modern physics, laying the foundation for such fields as [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). Many physicists regard Maxwell as the 19th-century scientist having the greatest influence on 20th-century physics. His contributions to the science are considered by many to be of the same magnitude as those of Isaac Newton and [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein").<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> In the millennium poll—a survey of the 100 most prominent physicists—Maxwell was voted the third greatest physicist of all time, behind only Newton and Einstein.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> On the centenary of Maxwell's birthday, Einstein described Maxwell's work as the "most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton".<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Einstein, when he visited the University of Cambridge in 1922, was told by his host that he had done great things because he stood on Newton's shoulders; Einstein replied: "No I don't. I stand on the shoulders of Maxwell."<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Tom Siegfried described Maxwell as "one of those once-in-a-century geniuses who perceived the physical world with sharper senses than those around him".<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

## Life

### Early life, 1831–1839

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/James_Clerk_Maxwell%27s_birthplace_at_14_India_Street.jpg/170px-James_Clerk_Maxwell%27s_birthplace_at_14_India_Street.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:James_Clerk_Maxwell%27s_birthplace_at_14_India_Street.jpg)

Clerk Maxwell's birthplace at 14 India Street in Edinburgh is now the home of the [James Clerk Maxwell Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell_Foundation "James Clerk Maxwell Foundation").

James Clerk Maxwell was born on 13 June 1831<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> at 14 India Street, [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh "Edinburgh"), to [John Clerk Maxwell of Middlebie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clerk_Maxwell_of_Middlebie "John Clerk Maxwell of Middlebie"), an advocate, and Frances Cay,<sup id="cite_ref-oxford_506_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-oxford_506-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Waterston_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Waterston-18">[18]</a></sup> daughter of [Robert Hodshon Cay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hodshon_Cay "Robert Hodshon Cay") and sister of [John Cay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cay "John Cay"). (His birthplace now houses a museum operated by the [James Clerk Maxwell Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell_Foundation "James Clerk Maxwell Foundation").) His father was a man of comfortable means<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> of the Clerk family of [Penicuik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicuik "Penicuik"), holders of the [baronetcy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baronetcy "Baronetcy") of [Clerk of Penicuik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerk_baronets "Clerk baronets"). His father's brother was the [6th baronet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_George_Clerk,_6th_Baronet "Sir George Clerk, 6th Baronet").<sup id="cite_ref-preface_20-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-preface-20">[20]</a></sup> He had been born "John Clerk", adding "Maxwell" to his own after he inherited (as an infant in 1793) the Middlebie estate, a Maxwell property in Dumfriesshire.<sup id="cite_ref-oxford_506_17-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-oxford_506-17">[17]</a></sup> James was a first cousin of both the artist [Jemima Blackburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemima_Blackburn "Jemima Blackburn")<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> (the daughter of his father's sister) and the civil engineer [William Dyce Cay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Dyce_Cay "William Dyce Cay") (the son of his mother's brother). Cay and Maxwell were close friends and Cay acted as his best man when Maxwell married.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

Maxwell's parents met and married when they were well into their thirties;<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> his mother was nearly 40 when he was born. They had had one earlier child, a daughter named Elizabeth, who died in infancy.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

When Maxwell was young his family moved to [Glenlair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenlair_House "Glenlair House"), in Kirkcudbrightshire, which his parents had built on the estate which comprised 1,500 acres (610 ha).<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> All indications suggest that Maxwell had maintained an unquenchable curiosity from an early age.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> By the age of three, everything that moved, shone, or made a noise drew the question: "what's the go o' that?"<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> In a passage added to a letter from his father to his sister-in-law Jane Cay in 1834, his mother described this innate sense of inquisitiveness:

> He is a very happy man, and has improved much since the weather got moderate; he has great work with doors, locks, keys, etc., and "show me how it doos" is never out of his mouth. He also investigates the hidden course of streams and bell-wires, the way the water gets from the pond through the wall....<sup id="cite_ref-Campbell_p_27_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Campbell_p_27-28">[28]</a></sup>

### Education, 1839–1847

Recognising the boy's potential, Maxwell's mother Frances took responsibility for his early education, which in the [Victorian era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_times "Victorian times") was largely the job of the woman of the house.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-:0-29">[29]</a></sup> At eight he could recite long passages of [John Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton "John Milton") and the whole of the [119th psalm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalm_119 "Psalm 119") (176 verses). Indeed, his knowledge of [scripture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text "Religious text") was already detailed; he could give chapter and verse for almost any quotation from the psalms. His mother was taken ill with [abdominal cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_cancer "Abdominal cancer") and, after an unsuccessful operation, died in December 1839 when he was eight years old. His education was then overseen by his father and his father's sister-in-law Jane, both of whom played pivotal roles in his life.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_29-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-:0-29">[29]</a></sup> His formal schooling began unsuccessfully under the guidance of a 16-year-old hired tutor. Little is known about the young man hired to instruct Maxwell, except that he treated the younger boy harshly, chiding him for being slow and wayward.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_29-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-:0-29">[29]</a></sup> The tutor was dismissed in November 1841. James' father took him to [Robert Davidson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Davidson_(inventor) "Robert Davidson (inventor)")'s demonstration of electric propulsion and magnetic force on 12 February 1842, an experience with profound implications for the boy.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

Maxwell was sent to the prestigious [Edinburgh Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Academy "Edinburgh Academy").<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> He lodged during term times at the house of his aunt Isabella. During this time his passion for drawing was encouraged by his older cousin Jemima.<sup id="cite_ref-mahon_p_12-14_32-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-mahon_p_12-14-32">[32]</a></sup> The 10-year-old Maxwell, having been raised in isolation on his father's countryside estate, did not fit in well at school.<sup id="cite_ref-mahon_p_10_33-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-mahon_p_10-33">[33]</a></sup> The first year had been full, obliging him to join the second year with classmates a year his senior.<sup id="cite_ref-mahon_p_10_33-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-mahon_p_10-33">[33]</a></sup> His mannerisms and [Galloway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galloway "Galloway") accent struck the other boys as rustic. Having arrived on his first day of school wearing a pair of homemade shoes and a tunic, he earned the unkind nickname of "[Daftie](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/daft "wikt:daft")".<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> He never seemed to resent the epithet, bearing it without complaint for many years.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> Social isolation at the Academy ended when he met [Lewis Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Campbell_(classicist) "Lewis Campbell (classicist)") and [Peter Guthrie Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Guthrie_Tait "Peter Guthrie Tait"), two boys of a similar age who were to become notable scholars later in life. They remained lifelong friends.<sup id="cite_ref-oxford_506_17-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-oxford_506-17">[17]</a></sup>

Maxwell was fascinated by [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry "Geometry") at an early age, rediscovering the [regular polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedra "Regular polyhedra") before he received any formal instruction.<sup id="cite_ref-mahon_p_12-14_32-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-mahon_p_12-14-32">[32]</a></sup> Despite his winning the school's scripture biography prize in his second year, his academic work remained unnoticed<sup id="cite_ref-mahon_p_12-14_32-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-mahon_p_12-14-32">[32]</a></sup> until, at the age of 13, he won the school's mathematical medal and first prize for both English and poetry.<sup id="cite_ref-Campbell,_p_43_36-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Campbell,_p_43-36">[36]</a></sup>

Maxwell's interests ranged far beyond the school syllabus and he did not pay particular attention to examination performance.<sup id="cite_ref-Campbell,_p_43_36-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Campbell,_p_43-36">[36]</a></sup> He wrote his first [scientific paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_paper "Scientific paper") at the age of 14. In it he described a mechanical means of drawing [mathematical curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve "Curve") with a piece of twine, and the properties of [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse "Ellipse"), [Cartesian ovals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_ovals "Cartesian ovals"), and related curves with more than two [foci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(geometry) "Focus (geometry)").

Old College, University of Edinburgh

Maxwell left the Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began attending classes at the [University of Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh "University of Edinburgh").<sup id="cite_ref-Harman_p_662_40-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Harman_p_662-40">[40]</a></sup> He had the opportunity to attend the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge"), but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of the university included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included [Sir William Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Hamilton,_9th_Baronet "Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet"), who lectured him on [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics "Metaphysics"), [Philip Kelland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kelland "Philip Kelland") on mathematics, and [James Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_David_Forbes "James David Forbes") on [natural philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy "Natural philosophy").<sup id="cite_ref-oxford_506_17-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-oxford_506-17">[17]</a></sup> He did not find his classes demanding,<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> and was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus; however, his chief concerns regarded the properties of [polarised light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarized_light "Polarized light").<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> He constructed shaped blocks of [gelatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatine "Gelatine"), subjected them to various [stresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(physics) "Stress (physics)"), and with a pair of [polarising prisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol_prism "Nicol prism") given to him by [William Nicol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nicol_(inventor) "William Nicol (inventor)"), viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> Through this practice he discovered [photoelasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelasticity "Photoelasticity"), which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>

At age 18, Maxwell contributed two papers for the [Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh "Royal Society of Edinburgh"). One of these, "On the Equilibrium of Elastic Solids", laid the foundation for an important discovery later in his life, which was the temporary [double refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_refraction "Double refraction") produced in [viscous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity "Viscosity") liquids by [shear stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_stress "Shear stress").<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> His other paper was "Rolling Curves" and, just as with the paper "Oval Curves" that he had written at the Edinburgh Academy, he was again considered too young to stand at the rostrum to present it himself.

A young Maxwell at [Trinity College, Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge "Trinity College, Cambridge"), holding one of his [colour wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_wheel "Colour wheel")

In October 1850, already an accomplished mathematician, Maxwell left Scotland for the [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge"). He initially attended [Peterhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterhouse,_Cambridge "Peterhouse, Cambridge"), but before the end of his first term transferred to [Trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge "Trinity College, Cambridge"), where he believed it would be easier to obtain a [fellowship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow "Fellow").<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> At Trinity he was elected to the elite secret society known as the [Cambridge Apostles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Apostles "Cambridge Apostles").<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> Maxwell's intellectual understanding of his Christian faith and of science grew rapidly during his Cambridge years. He joined the "Apostles", an exclusive debating society of the intellectual elite, where through his essays he sought to work out this understanding.

> Now my great plan, which was conceived of old, ... is to let nothing be wilfully left unexamined. Nothing is to be holy ground consecrated to Stationary Faith, whether positive or negative. All fallow land is to be ploughed up and a regular system of rotation followed. ... Never hide anything, be it weed or no, nor seem to wish it hidden. ... Again I assert the Right of Trespass on any plot of Holy Ground which any man has set apart. ... Now I am convinced that no one but a Christian can actually purge his land of these holy spots. ... I do not say that no Christians have enclosed places of this sort. Many have a great deal, and every one has some. But there are extensive and important tracts in the territory of the Scoffer, the Pantheist, the Quietist, Formalist, Dogmatist, Sensualist, and the rest, which are openly and solemnly Tabooed. ..."
> 
> Christianity—that is, the religion of the Bible—is the only scheme or form of belief which disavows any possessions on such a tenure. Here alone all is free. You may fly to the ends of the world and find no God but the Author of Salvation. You may search the Scriptures and not find a text to stop you in your explorations. ...
> 
> The Old Testament and the Mosaic Law and Judaism are commonly supposed to be "Tabooed" by the orthodox. Sceptics pretend to have read them and have found certain witty objections ... which too many of the orthodox unread admit, and shut up the subject as haunted. But a Candle is coming to drive out all Ghosts and Bugbears. Let us follow the light.<sup id="cite_ref-MIT_IAP_Seminar_50-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-MIT_IAP_Seminar-50">[50]</a></sup>

In the summer of his third year, Maxwell spent some time at the [Suffolk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otley,_Suffolk "Otley, Suffolk") home of the Rev. [C. B. Tayler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Benjamin_Tayler "Charles Benjamin Tayler"), the uncle of a classmate, G. W. H. Tayler. The love of God shown by the family impressed Maxwell, particularly after he was nursed back from ill health by the minister and his wife.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>

On his return to Cambridge, Maxwell writes to his recent host a chatty and affectionate letter including the following testimony,<sup id="cite_ref-MIT_IAP_Seminar_50-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-MIT_IAP_Seminar-50">[50]</a></sup>

> ... I have the capacity of being more wicked than any example that man could set me, and ... if I escape, it is only by God's grace helping me to get rid of myself, partially in science, more completely in society, —but not perfectly except by committing myself to God ...

In November 1851, Maxwell studied under [William Hopkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hopkins "William Hopkins"), whose success in nurturing mathematical genius had earned him the nickname of "[senior wrangler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Wrangler_(University_of_Cambridge) "Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)")\-maker".<sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup>

In 1854, Maxwell graduated from Trinity with a degree in mathematics. He scored second highest in the final examination, coming behind [Edward Routh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Routh "Edward Routh") and earning himself the title of Second Wrangler. He was later declared equal with Routh in the more exacting ordeal of the [Smith's Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%27s_Prize "Smith's Prize") examination.<sup id="cite_ref-Tolstoy_p_62_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Tolstoy_p_62-53">[53]</a></sup> Immediately after earning his degree, Maxwell read his paper "On the Transformation of Surfaces by Bending" to the [Cambridge Philosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Philosophical_Society "Cambridge Philosophical Society").<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> This is one of the few purely mathematical papers he had written, demonstrating his growing stature as a mathematician.<sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> Maxwell decided to remain at Trinity after graduating and applied for a fellowship, which was a process that he could expect to take a couple of years.<sup id="cite_ref-Mahon_p_47-48_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Mahon_p_47-48-56">[56]</a></sup> Buoyed by his success as a research student, he would be free, apart from some tutoring and examining duties, to pursue scientific interests at his own leisure.<sup id="cite_ref-Mahon_p_47-48_56-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Mahon_p_47-48-56">[56]</a></sup>

The nature and perception of colour was one such interest which he had begun at the University of Edinburgh while he was a student of Forbes.<sup id="cite_ref-Mahon_p_51_57-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Mahon_p_51-57">[57]</a></sup> With the coloured [spinning tops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_top "Spinning top") invented by Forbes, Maxwell was able to demonstrate that white light would result from a mixture of red, green, and blue light.<sup id="cite_ref-Mahon_p_51_57-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Mahon_p_51-57">[57]</a></sup> His paper "Experiments on Colour" laid out the principles of colour combination and was presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March 1855.<sup id="cite_ref-Tolstoy_p_64-65_58-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Tolstoy_p_64-65-58">[58]</a></sup> Maxwell was this time able to deliver it himself.<sup id="cite_ref-Tolstoy_p_64-65_58-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Tolstoy_p_64-65-58">[58]</a></sup>

Maxwell was made a fellow of Trinity on 10 October 1855, sooner than was the norm,<sup id="cite_ref-Tolstoy_p_64-65_58-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Tolstoy_p_64-65-58">[58]</a></sup> and was asked to prepare lectures on [hydrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatics "Hydrostatics") and [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics "Optics") and to set examination papers.<sup id="cite_ref-Glazebrook_p_43-46_59-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Glazebrook_p_43-46-59">[59]</a></sup> The following February he was urged by Forbes to apply for the newly vacant [Chair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_(academic) "Chair (academic)") of Natural Philosophy at [Marischal College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marischal_College "Marischal College"), [Aberdeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen "Aberdeen").<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Campbell_p_126_61-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Campbell_p_126-61">[61]</a></sup> His father assisted him in the task of preparing the necessary references, but died on 2 April at Glenlair before either knew the result of Maxwell's candidacy.<sup id="cite_ref-Campbell_p_126_61-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Campbell_p_126-61">[61]</a></sup> He accepted the professorship at Aberdeen, leaving Cambridge in November 1856.<sup id="cite_ref-Glazebrook_p_43-46_59-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Glazebrook_p_43-46-59">[59]</a></sup>

Maxwell proved that the [rings of Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn "Rings of Saturn") were made of numerous small particles.

The 25-year-old Maxwell was a good 15 years younger than any other professor at Marischal. He engaged himself with his new responsibilities as head of a department, devising the syllabus and preparing lectures.<sup id="cite_ref-Mahon_p_69-71_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Mahon_p_69-71-62">[62]</a></sup> He committed himself to lecturing 15 hours a week, including a weekly _[pro bono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_bono "Pro bono")_ lecture to the local working men's college.<sup id="cite_ref-Mahon_p_69-71_62-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Mahon_p_69-71-62">[62]</a></sup> He lived in Aberdeen with his cousin [William Dyce Cay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Dyce_Cay "William Dyce Cay"), a Scottish civil engineer, during the six months of the academic year and spent the summers at Glenlair, which he had inherited from his father.<sup id="cite_ref-preface_20-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-preface-20">[20]</a></sup>

He focused his attention on a problem that had eluded scientists for 200 years: the nature of [Saturn's rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn "Rings of Saturn"). It was unknown how they could remain stable without breaking up, drifting away or crashing into Saturn.<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> The problem took on a particular resonance at that time because [St John's College, Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge "St John's College, Cambridge"), had chosen it as the topic for the 1857 [Adams Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_Prize "Adams Prize").<sup id="cite_ref-oxford_508_64-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-oxford_508-64">[64]</a></sup> Maxwell devoted two years to studying the problem, proving that a regular solid ring could not be stable, while a fluid ring would be forced by wave action to break up into blobs. Since neither was observed, he concluded that the rings must be composed of numerous small particles he called "brick-bats", each independently orbiting Saturn.<sup id="cite_ref-oxford_508_64-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-oxford_508-64">[64]</a></sup> Maxwell was awarded the £130 Adams Prize in 1859 for his essay "On the stability of the motion of Saturn's rings";<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> he was the only entrant to have made enough headway to submit an entry.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> His work was so detailed and convincing that when [George Biddell Airy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Biddell_Airy "George Biddell Airy") read it he commented, "It is one of the most remarkable applications of mathematics to physics that I have ever seen."<sup id="cite_ref-mactutor_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-mactutor-1">[1]</a></sup> It was considered the final word on the issue until direct observations by the _[Voyager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program "Voyager program")_ flybys of the 1980s confirmed Maxwell's prediction that the rings were composed of particles.<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> It is now understood, however, that the rings' particles are not totally stable, being pulled by gravity onto Saturn. The rings are expected to vanish entirely over the next 300 million years.<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>

In 1857 Maxwell befriended the Reverend Daniel Dewar, who was then the Principal of Marischal.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> Through him Maxwell met Dewar's daughter, [Katherine Mary Dewar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Clerk_Maxwell "Katherine Clerk Maxwell"). They were engaged in February 1858 and married in Aberdeen on 2 June 1858. On the marriage record, Maxwell is listed as Professor of Natural Philosophy in Marischal College, Aberdeen.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> Katherine was seven years Maxwell's senior. Comparatively little is known of her, although it is known that she helped in his lab and worked on experiments in [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity "Viscosity").<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> Maxwell's biographer and friend, Lewis Campbell, adopted an uncharacteristic reticence on the subject of Katherine, though describing their married life as "one of unexampled devotion".<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup>

In 1860 Marischal College merged with the neighbouring [King's College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_College,_Aberdeen "King's College, Aberdeen") to form the [University of Aberdeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen "University of Aberdeen"). There was no room for two professors of Natural Philosophy, so Maxwell, despite his scientific reputation, found himself laid off. He was unsuccessful in applying for Forbes's recently vacated chair at Edinburgh, the post instead going to [Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tait_(physicist) "Peter Tait (physicist)"). Maxwell was granted the Chair of Natural Philosophy at [King's College, London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_College,_London "King's College, London"), instead.<sup id="cite_ref-Glazebrook_p_54_73-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Glazebrook_p_54-73">[73]</a></sup> After recovering from a near-fatal bout of [smallpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox "Smallpox") in 1860, he moved to London with his wife.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>

Maxwell's time at King's was probably the most productive of his career. He was awarded the [Royal Society's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society "Royal Society") [Rumford Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumford_Medal "Rumford Medal") in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861.<sup id="cite_ref-Tolstoy_p_103-104_76-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Tolstoy_p_103-104-76">[76]</a></sup> This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the [viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity "Viscosity") of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis"). Maxwell would often attend lectures at the [Royal Institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Institution "Royal Institution"), where he came into regular contact with [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday "Michael Faraday"). The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40 years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of [senility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senility "Senility"). They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup>

This time is especially noteworthy for the advances Maxwell made in the fields of electricity and magnetism. He examined the nature of both electric and magnetic fields in his two-part paper "[On physical lines of force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_physical_lines_of_force "On physical lines of force")", which was published in 1861. In it he provided a conceptual model for [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction"), consisting of tiny spinning cells of [magnetic flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_flux "Magnetic flux"). Two more parts were later added to and published in that same paper in early 1862. In the first additional part he discussed the nature of [electrostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatics "Electrostatics") and [displacement current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_current "Displacement current"). In the second additional part, he dealt with the rotation of the plane of the [polarisation of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves) "Polarization (waves)") in a magnetic field, a phenomenon that had been discovered by Faraday and is now known as the [Faraday effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_effect "Faraday effect").<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup>

In 1865 Maxwell resigned the chair at King's College, London, and returned to Glenlair with Katherine. In his paper "On governors" (1868) he mathematically described the behaviour of [governors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(device) "Governor (device)")—devices that control the speed of steam engines—thereby establishing the theoretical basis of control engineering.<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> In his paper "On reciprocal figures, frames and diagrams of forces" (1870) he discussed the rigidity of various designs of lattice.<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> He wrote the textbook _Theory of Heat_ (1871) and the treatise _Matter and Motion_ (1876). Maxwell was also the first to make explicit use of [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis "Dimensional analysis"), in 1871.<sup id="cite_ref-82"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup>

In 1871 he returned to Cambridge to become the first [Cavendish Professor of Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_Professor_of_Physics "Cavendish Professor of Physics").<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> Maxwell was put in charge of the development of the [Cavendish Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_Laboratory "Cavendish Laboratory"), supervising every step in the progress of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus.<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of [Henry Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish "Henry Cavendish"), from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other things, such questions as the [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density "Density") of the Earth and the composition of water.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> He was elected as a member to the [American Philosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Philosophical_Society "American Philosophical Society") in 1876.<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>

In April 1879 Maxwell began to have difficulty in swallowing, the first symptom of his fatal illness.<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>

Maxwell died in Cambridge of abdominal cancer on 5 November 1879 at the age of 48.<sup id="cite_ref-Harman_p_662_40-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Harman_p_662-40">[40]</a></sup> His mother had died at the same age of the same type of cancer.<sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> The minister who regularly visited him in his last weeks was astonished at his lucidity and the immense power and scope of his memory, but comments more particularly,

> ... his illness drew out the whole heart and soul and spirit of the man: his firm and undoubting faith in the Incarnation and all its results; in the full sufficiency of the Atonement; in the work of the Holy Spirit. He had gauged and fathomed all the schemes and systems of philosophy, and had found them utterly empty and unsatisfying—"unworkable" was his own word about them—and he turned with simple faith to the Gospel of the Saviour.

As death approached Maxwell told a Cambridge colleague,<sup id="cite_ref-MIT_IAP_Seminar_50-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-MIT_IAP_Seminar-50">[50]</a></sup>

> I have been thinking how very gently I have always been dealt with. I have never had a violent shove all my life. The only desire which I can have is like David to serve my own generation by the will of God, and then fall asleep.

Maxwell is buried at [Parton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parton,_Dumfries_and_Galloway "Parton, Dumfries and Galloway") Kirk, near [Castle Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Douglas "Castle Douglas") in Galloway close to where he grew up.<sup id="cite_ref-89"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> The extended biography _The Life of James Clerk Maxwell_, by his former schoolfellow and lifelong friend Professor [Lewis Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Campbell_(classicist) "Lewis Campbell (classicist)"), was published in 1882.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup> His collected works were issued in two volumes by the [Cambridge University Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press "Cambridge University Press") in 1890.<sup id="cite_ref-92"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>

### Personal life

As a great lover of [Scottish poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_poetry "Scottish poetry"), Maxwell memorised poems and wrote his own.<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> The best known is _Rigid Body Sings_, closely based on "[Comin' Through the Rye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comin%27_Through_the_Rye "Comin' Through the Rye")" by [Robert Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns "Robert Burns"), which he apparently used to sing while accompanying himself on a guitar. It has the opening lines<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>

> Gin a body meet a body  
> 
> Flyin' through the air.  
> Gin a body hit a body,  
> 
> Will it fly? And where?

A collection of his poems was published by his friend [Lewis Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Campbell_(classicist) "Lewis Campbell (classicist)") in 1882.<sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup>

Descriptions of Maxwell remark upon his remarkable intellectual qualities being matched by social awkwardness.<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup>

Maxwell wrote the following aphorism for his own conduct as a scientist:

> He that would enjoy life and act with freedom must have the work of the day continually before his eyes. Not yesterday's work, lest he fall into despair, not to-morrow's, lest he become a visionary not that which ends with the day, which is a worldly work, nor yet that only which remains to eternity, for by it he cannot shape his action. Happy is the man who can recognize in the work of to-day a connected portion of the work of life, and an embodiment of the work of eternity. The foundations of his confidence are unchangeable, for he has been made a partaker of Infinity. He strenuously works out his daily enterprises, because the present is given him for a possession.<sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup>

Maxwell was an evangelical [Presbyterian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterianism "Presbyterianism") and in his later years became an [Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_of_the_Church_of_Scotland "Elder of the Church of Scotland") of the [Church of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Scotland "Church of Scotland").<sup id="cite_ref-The_Aberdeen_University_Press_100-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-The_Aberdeen_University_Press-100">[100]</a></sup> Maxwell's religious beliefs and related activities have been the focus of a number of papers.<sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Rel00_102-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Rel00-102">[102]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Rel1_103-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Rel1-103">[103]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup> Attending both Church of Scotland (his father's denomination) and [Episcopalian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Episcopal_Church "Scottish Episcopal Church") (his mother's denomination) services as a child, Maxwell underwent an [evangelical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism "Evangelicalism") conversion in April 1853.

## Scientific legacy

### Electromagnetism

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Postcard-from-Maxwell-to-Tait.jpg/220px-Postcard-from-Maxwell-to-Tait.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Postcard-from-Maxwell-to-Tait.jpg)

A postcard from Maxwell to [Peter Tait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Guthrie_Tait "Peter Guthrie Tait")

Maxwell had studied and commented on electricity and magnetism as early as 1855 when his paper "On Faraday's lines of force" was read to the [Cambridge Philosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Philosophical_Society "Cambridge Philosophical Society").<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup> The paper presented a simplified model of Faraday's work and how electricity and magnetism are related. He reduced all of the current knowledge into a linked set of [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") with 20 equations in 20 variables. This work was later published as "[On Physical Lines of Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Physical_Lines_of_Force "On Physical Lines of Force")" in March 1861.<sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup>

Around 1862, while lecturing at King's College, Maxwell calculated that the speed of propagation of an electromagnetic field is approximately that of the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"). He considered this to be more than just a coincidence, commenting, "We can scarcely avoid the conclusion that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.<sup id="cite_ref-mactutor_1-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-mactutor-1">[1]</a></sup>

Working on the problem further, Maxwell showed that the [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave_equation "Electromagnetic wave equation") predict the existence of waves of [oscillating electric and magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") that travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments; using the data available at the time, Maxwell obtained a velocity of 310,740,000 metres per second (1.0195×10<sup>9</sup> ft/s).<sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup> In his 1865 paper "[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dynamical_Theory_of_the_Electromagnetic_Field "A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field")", Maxwell wrote, "The agreement of the results seems to show that light and magnetism are affections of the same substance, and that light is an electromagnetic disturbance propagated through the field according to electromagnetic laws".<sup id="cite_ref-ADTEF_4-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-ADTEF-4">[4]</a></sup>

His famous twenty equations, in their modern form of [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"), first appeared in fully developed form in his textbook _[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Treatise_on_Electricity_and_Magnetism "A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism")_ in 1873.<sup id="cite_ref-108"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup> Most of this work was done by Maxwell at Glenlair during the period between holding his London post and his taking up the Cavendish chair.<sup id="cite_ref-mactutor_1-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-mactutor-1">[1]</a></sup> [Oliver Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Heaviside "Oliver Heaviside") reduced the complexity of Maxwell's theory down to four [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation "Partial differential equation"),<sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup> known now collectively as Maxwell's Laws or [Maxwell's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations "Maxwell's equations"). Although potentials became much less popular in the nineteenth century,<sup id="cite_ref-110"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-110">[110]</a></sup> the use of scalar and vector potentials is now standard in the solution of Maxwell's equations.<sup id="cite_ref-111"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup>

As Barrett and Grimes (1995) describe:<sup id="cite_ref-112"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup>

> Maxwell expressed electromagnetism in the algebra of [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions "Quaternions") and made the electromagnetic potential the centerpiece of his theory. In 1881 Heaviside replaced the electromagnetic potential field by force fields as the centerpiece of electromagnetic theory. According to Heaviside, the electromagnetic potential field was arbitrary and needed to be "assassinated". (_sic_) A few years later there was a debate between Heaviside and [\[Peter Guthrie\] Tate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Guthrie_Tait "Peter Guthrie Tait") (_sic_) about the relative merits of [vector analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_analysis "Vector analysis") and [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions "Quaternions"). The result was the realization that there was no need for the greater physical insights provided by [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions "Quaternions") if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace.

Maxwell was proved correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th-century [mathematical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics "Mathematical physics").<sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup>

Maxwell also introduced the concept of the _electromagnetic field_ in comparison to force lines that Faraday described.<sup id="cite_ref-tef_114-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-tef-114">[114]</a></sup> By understanding the propagation of electromagnetism as a field emitted by active particles, Maxwell could advance his work on light. At that time, Maxwell believed that the propagation of light required a medium for the waves, dubbed the [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether "Luminiferous aether").<sup id="cite_ref-tef_114-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-tef-114">[114]</a></sup> Over time, the existence of such a medium, permeating all space and yet apparently undetectable by mechanical means, proved impossible to reconcile with experiments such as the [Michelson–Morley experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment "Michelson–Morley experiment").<sup id="cite_ref-115"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup> Moreover, it seemed to require an absolute [frame of reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference "Frame of reference") in which the equations were valid, with the distasteful result that the equations changed form for a moving observer. These difficulties inspired [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") to formulate the theory of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity"); in the process Einstein dispensed with the requirement of a stationary luminiferous aether.<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup>

### Colour vision

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Tartan_Ribbon.jpg/220px-Tartan_Ribbon.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tartan_Ribbon.jpg)

First durable colour photographic image, demonstrated by Maxwell in an 1861 lecture

Along with most physicists of the time, Maxwell had a strong interest in psychology. Following in the steps of [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)"), he was particularly interested in the study of [colour vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_vision "Colour vision"). From 1855 to 1872, Maxwell published at intervals a series of investigations concerning the perception of colour, [colour-blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour-blindness "Colour-blindness"), and colour theory, and was awarded the [Rumford Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumford_Medal "Rumford Medal") for "On the Theory of Colour Vision".<sup id="cite_ref-117"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup>

[Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") had demonstrated, using prisms, that white light, such as [sunlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight "Sunlight"), is composed of a number of [monochromatic components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color "Spectral color") which could then be recombined into white light.<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup> Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called _[metameres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color) "Metamerism (color)")_. [Thomas Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist) "Thomas Young (scientist)") later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold,<sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> the _[trichromatic colour theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%E2%80%93Helmholtz_theory "Young–Helmholtz theory")_. Maxwell used the recently developed [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra "Linear algebra") to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case,<sup id="cite_ref-120"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup> inventing colour matching experiments and [Colourimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colourimetry "Colourimetry").

Maxwell was also interested in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in [colour photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_photography "Colour photography"). Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced with a set of three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through [red, green, and blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model "RGB color model") [filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(optics) "Filter (optics)"), and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.<sup id="cite_ref-121"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup>

During an 1861 Royal Institution lecture on colour theory, Maxwell presented the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. [Thomas Sutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sutton_(photographer) "Thomas Sutton (photographer)"), inventor of the [single-lens reflex camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera "Single-lens reflex camera"), took the picture. He photographed a [tartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan "Tartan") ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's [photographic plates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_plate "Photographic plate") were insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, the results of this pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that "if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue", it "would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved."<sup id="cite_ref-Tolstoy_p_103-104_76-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Tolstoy_p_103-104-76">[76]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-122"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-123"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup> Researchers in 1961 concluded that the seemingly impossible partial success of the red-filtered exposure was due to [ultraviolet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet "Ultraviolet") light, which is strongly reflected by some red dyes, not entirely blocked by the red filter used, and within the range of sensitivity of the [wet collodion process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collodion_process "Collodion process") Sutton employed.<sup id="cite_ref-124"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup>

### Kinetic theory and thermodynamics

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Maxwell%27s_demon.svg/220px-Maxwell%27s_demon.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maxwell%27s_demon.svg)

[Maxwell's demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon "Maxwell's demon"), a thought experiment where entropy decreases

Maxwell also investigated the [kinetic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases "Kinetic theory of gases") of gases. Originating with [Daniel Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli "Daniel Bernoulli"), this theory was advanced by the successive labours of [John Herapath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herapath "John Herapath"), [John James Waterston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Waterston "John James Waterston"), [James Joule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Prescott_Joule "James Prescott Joule"), and particularly [Rudolf Clausius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Clausius "Rudolf Clausius"), to such an extent as to put its general accuracy beyond a doubt; but it received enormous development from Maxwell, who in this field appeared as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) as well as a mathematician.<sup id="cite_ref-125"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup>

Between 1859 and 1866, he developed the theory of the distributions of velocities in particles of a gas, work later generalised by [Ludwig Boltzmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann "Ludwig Boltzmann").<sup id="cite_ref-126"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-127"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup> The formula, called the [Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution "Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution"), gives the fraction of gas molecules moving at a specified velocity at any given temperature. In the [kinetic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory_of_gases "Kinetic theory of gases"), temperatures and heat involve only molecular movement. This approach generalised the previously established laws of thermodynamics and explained existing observations and experiments in a better way than had been achieved previously. His work on [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") led him to devise the [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment "Thought experiment") that came to be known as [Maxwell's demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon "Maxwell's demon"), where the [second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics "Second law of thermodynamics") is violated by an imaginary being capable of sorting particles by energy.<sup id="cite_ref-128"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>

In 1871, he established [Maxwell's thermodynamic relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_relations "Maxwell relations"), which are statements of equality among the second derivatives of the [thermodynamic potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_potentials "Thermodynamic potentials") with respect to different thermodynamic variables. In 1874, he constructed a [plaster thermodynamic visualisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_thermodynamic_surface "Maxwell's thermodynamic surface") as a way of exploring phase transitions, based on the American scientist [Josiah Willard Gibbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs "Josiah Willard Gibbs")'s graphical [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics "Thermodynamics") papers.<sup id="cite_ref-129"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-130"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup>

### Control theory

Maxwell published the paper "On governors" in the _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, vol. 16 (1867–1868).<sup id="cite_ref-Maxwell1867_131-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-Maxwell1867-131">[131]</a></sup> This paper is considered a central paper of the early days of [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory "Control theory").<sup id="cite_ref-132"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup> Here "governors" refers to the [governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(device) "Governor (device)") or the [centrifugal governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor "Centrifugal governor") used to regulate [steam engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine "Steam engine").
