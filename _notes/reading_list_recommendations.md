* 🟩 **[benwiener](https://www.reddit.com/user/benwiener)** ⬆️ 38 _(2021-06-13 07:57:06)_

	1/ **7 Powers** by Hamilton Helmer - one investor called this "the best business book in history." Not as well known as others, but based on decades of case studies: the seven strategies that provide extended, sustainable competitive advantage. This book is so important that i may or may not have just published a mystery [novel](https://www.amazon.com/Murder-First-Principles-Ben-Wiener/dp/B096LS48ZC/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1623409307&amp;sr=8-2) about it...

	2/ **Crossing the Chasm** by Geoffrey Moore: The famous description of market subdivisions (Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority etc.) and go-to-market strategies for tackling each subdivision.

	3/ **Play Bigger** by Lochhead, Peterson et al: Like 7 Powers, not as famous, but a companion to Crossing the Chasm - a step-by-step playbook for creating your product's market as a newly-defined market rather than a "me-too" competitor in an existing market.

	4/ **Zero to One** by Peter Thiel:  The must-read for any beginning startup entrepreneur.

	5/ **Never Split the Difference** by chris Voss: Specific to negotiation strategy; written by former chief CIA hostage negotiator with surprisingly actionable and often counter-intuitive strategies for 1:1 situations in the business world.

		Just read 7 Powers and recommend it as well. It's nothing revolutionary. But, a good distillation and to the point.

* 🟩 **[IcAliens](https://www.reddit.com/user/IcAliens)** ⬆️ 23 _(2021-05-31 23:49:05)_

	I’m reading The 33 Strategies of War by Robert Greene and I love it. Greene uses a ton of historical anecdotes to develop strategies to put to use in our social lives.

	* 🟨 **[Extra_Attitude](https://www.reddit.com/user/Extra_Attitude)** ⬆️ 5 _(2021-06-02 10:52:47)_

		I was literally thinking of this as soon as I read the post! Can't recommend this enough! Do you know of anything similar in terms of his historical anecdotes? I've listened to other popular works like art of War, the Prince, the book of five rings, etc... but its hard to find anything about tactics and strategy that really taps into the thought process of historical  figures like Greene's book does... most books and documentaries are typically like "in 600 AD so and so did this"...

		* 🟧 **[IcAliens](https://www.reddit.com/user/IcAliens)** ⬆️ 7 _(2021-06-02 10:55:42)_

			Haha I’m in the same boat as you. I love all of Greene’s books and am trying to find authors that have a similar style to his works. Hopefully others will have some good recommendations.
			
			Edit: try checking out Illacertus on YouTube. He does analyses of all of Greene’s books along with other strategy books. He has some great recommended readings.

	Lawrence Freedman – "Strategy: a History". Book born out of 25+ years of writing by one of the cleverest strategic researchers and practicioners in the world. From this book you'd get a links to a dozens of foundational sources almost on every facet of strategic reality.

	1. [Good Strategy/Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt](https://amzn.to/2UFlQ1P) \- seeing the bad spelt out is as valuable as having the good explained.

	2. [Everybody Lies by Stephen Seth-Davidowitz](https://amzn.to/3wFSXQc) \- for understanding that the world is not the way people claim it is.

	3. [The Art of War by Sun Tzu](https://amzn.to/3idNLy3) \- because every strategist should read it and realise that we understood this for thousands of years.

	4. [The Lean Startup by Eric Reis](https://amzn.to/3xEPL8R) \- because even mature organisations should think like startups.

	5. [Understanding Michael Porter by Joan Magretta](https://amzn.to/3idOmjh) \- because he has forgotten more about strategy than most of us will ever know and is vastly misunderstood.

	* 🟨 **[MisterDumay](https://www.reddit.com/user/MisterDumay)** ⬆️ 8 _(2023-01-08 13:45:17)_

		Good Strategy / Bad Strategy is one of my favorites

		But Porter has...forgot about strategy? Other people forgot about him? Sorry, just need clarification

		* 🟧 **[chriscfoxStrategy](https://www.reddit.com/user/chriscfoxStrategy)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-11-23 13:24:52)_

			Apologies, that is an English idiom. When you say that someone has forgotten more about something than someone else knows, it means that the first person knows vastly more than the second. Porter knows vastly more about strategy than most other people.

* 🟩 **[wave-drop](https://www.reddit.com/user/wave-drop)** ⬆️ 10 _(2022-04-19 12:22:39)_

	I think that the best books about business and strategy are not books about business and strategy at all, but rather books about philosophy and life. These books will teach you how to think when the business books teach anything but what really matters. One of the most important lesson I've learnt is life gives you what you are and not what you want.  The state of mind of a person is his most important asset, because it acts on our perceptions and our perceptions influence our reality. Therefore if you want to change your life you should start by changing your mind. 

	Now, for the list:

	\- **Outwitting the devil by Napoleon Hill (easy to read):** The author wrote many books about the subject of getting rich, but I think this one is worth all the others combined. It probably was his best book and ironically it was published after his death. It is labeled as a fictional conversation between the author and the devil. They talk about many subjects with always the same topic in mind: "how can one get whatever he or she desires from life?".

	**- The ethics by Spinoza (extremely hard to read, but so much worth the effort):** Here, the author -a dutch philosopher of the 17th century regarded by many as the best philosopher of the west- explains with an extremely rigorous and mathematical methodology the nature of life and the nature of god (for him, they're the same thing). It is really one of the most challenging reading I've ever experienced in my life, but again, it was worth every ounce of effort I've put in and would recommend it to anyone. To ease the reading and understand more of the book, you can find plenty of explanations on the internet and many books were specifically written to explain the ethics (yes, it is that hard). Spinoza believed that to live a good life, you should know it better. With the knowledge in hand you can then get anything you desire from it.

	**- De Vita Beata by Seneca (easy to medium):** The greeks had it all figured out. And I mean the whole thing, life, the nature of things and all the rest. Their only flaw was they didn't really know or could not accurately explain why the way they chose to live seemed to work and grant abundance and happiness (something Spinoza does masterfully). Stoicism is a very large subject in philosophy, and De Vita Beata ('on the happy life' in english) could be an entry point. Seneca gives the blueprint to live a great and full life that could grant you anything you desire. Where Spinoza tries to explain why things work that way and not another, Seneca focuses solely on what works therefore making his teachings a lot more accessible. It is pure golden.

	Thanks for letting me share!

	* 🟨 **[applejackalll](https://www.reddit.com/user/applejackalll)** ⬆️ 2 _(2022-07-05 12:24:39)_

		I totally agree with the idea that the best learnings come from ideas presented in philosophy. Learning how to think is something that I’ve only recently begun exploring. It started with research on critical thinking and now I’m looking to explore further. Any suggestions on material of ‘how to think’?

		* 🟧 **[wave-drop](https://www.reddit.com/user/wave-drop)** ⬆️ 2 _(2022-07-06 18:24:49)_

			All the books mentioned are great for this subject. They will teach you that the only true form of thinking is of free thinking and is easily attainable by following one rule: to always stay true to who you are, to never lie to yourself and to always get to where the truth is even when it might hurt your feelings. Free thought is a natural aptitude that all human beings possess without exception, they only have to use it.

	* 🟨 **[kennyfraser](https://www.reddit.com/user/kennyfraser)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-23 13:48:45)_

		You make a great point - not least because so many business books are badly written even when the ideas are good. I even turn to fiction in some cases. The character of Thomas Cromwell in the Wolf Hall trilogy is an excellent leadership role model.

* 🟩 **[nolander_78](https://www.reddit.com/user/nolander_78)** ⬆️ 8 _(2022-06-04 14:22:12)_

	I'm sorryI might be in the wrong place after reading these comments, why is no one mentioning Michael Porter although he's praised as the father of modern day business strategy?

* 🟩 **[afroglives](https://www.reddit.com/user/afroglives)** ⬆️ 5 _(2022-05-29 03:13:02)_

	Some great recommendations here. I tried to think about books that have influenced me the most, rather than books that are the ‘best’ or ‘most useful’ for a strategist. So, here goes:

	1. Strategy Safari, Henry Mintzberg et al. I think this one is important because it reminds us that there are many different ways of setting and realising strategy. Most people have an opinion about the ‘right’ way, but there actually isn’t one best way.

	2. Playing To Win, Lafley &amp; Martin. Mentioned here already, but I have to include it as I still think it is the most clear and cogent explanation of how to make strategic choices. I was lucky enough to be trained by Roger Martin as it happens.

	3. Destruction &amp; Creation, John Boyd. Not a book, but a brilliant paper on how strategic decisions get made. A classic and something that has been hugely influential for me.

	4. Thinking in Bets, Annie Duke. Not a book about strategy and drifts a bit towards the end, but a very clear reminder that every strategic choice is a bet and bets can go two ways. Process is what is important - the outcome can go against you.

	5. The Innovator’s Dilemma, Clay Christensen. Still a classic and a great book to come back to when you’re wondering how to create new value in an industry.

* 🟩 **[StrategyViz](https://www.reddit.com/user/StrategyViz)** ⬆️ 4 _(2021-08-21 05:55:08)_

	**Strategy:** a history (Lawrence Freedman, 2013).   

	Comprehensive overview of strategy, from origins of warfare to business strategies. Quite thick and dense, but individual chapters can be read seperately. There is also an audio book available.

	**Strategy safari:** A Guided Tour Through the Wilds of Strategic Management (Mintzberg et al, 1998/2008).   

	Focused on business strategy, a great overview of the various perspectives.

	**Strategy in 3D:** Essential Tools to Diagnose, Decide, and Deliver (Fisher et al., 2020).   

	More of a practical book about business strategy and tools.

* 🟩 **[Bleepblooping](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bleepblooping)** ⬆️ 4 _(2021-06-03 08:29:11)_

* 🟩 **[bdua217](https://www.reddit.com/user/bdua217)** ⬆️ 4 _(2021-07-27 12:30:02)_

	**Patterns of Strategy** by Patrick Hoverstadt &amp; Lucy Loh

	Looks at strategy as **changing fitness with environment to one's own advantage by concentrating power in time**.

	Emergent strategy is seen as the product of the structural couplings that one entity has with other entities in its ecosystem (structural coupling comes from evolutionary biology / Maturana and it happens when both entity A influences the evolution of entity B and viceversa)

	Power, Fit and Time are seen as key dimensions of strategy (most of the strategy in books and in practice focuses mainly on Power).

	Each of these three dimensions has multiple facets. For example Time has synchronicity (faster, synchronized, slower than the other entity), cycle time, foresight and change rate.

	There are 80 patterns of strategy shared in the book - really insightful to identify how these patterns combine and play out in the real world.

	Hope you enjoy it, it's very different than the other books

	Your Strategy Needs a Strategy

	Awesome book by top BCG consultants. The books simplifies different stages and proven methods to determine the strategy approach that is best for you business.

	They start by helping you assess the business environment.

	They show how existing strategy approaches sort into 5 categories: be big, be fast, be first, be the orchestrator or be viable.

	Highly recommend.

				I like historical perspective, so there is one particular books I really like:   
				
				
				**"Strategy of the Byzantine Empire"** by Edward Luttwak. Byzantine, or rather Eastern Roman Empire has surivived for about 1000 years with it's strategy based almost purely on diplomatic and bureaucratic apparatus. Very cool, systemic read written by one of the most prominent living practicing strategists.

* 🟩 **[Tyrantthelittle](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tyrantthelittle)** ⬆️ 3 _(2022-07-20 19:21:02)_

	On Grand Strategy by John Lewis Gaddis

	It's a broadly encompassing text on strategic theory using historical examples like the Greeks as well as some of the big names we often associate to high light principle concepts ( Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, etc).

* 🟩 **[galactic-beyond](https://www.reddit.com/user/galactic-beyond)** ⬆️ 2 _(2022-10-29 19:15:35)_

	The Evolution of Strategy by Beatrice Heuser -- A very big-picture, chronological view of strategy, that will place the evolution of it in dialectical terms.

	The Psychology of Strategy by Kenneth Payne -- Takes a sociological/psychological approach to strategy that provides contrast with the dominant "rational-player" viewpoint that dominates most theory (not a substitute but complementary).

	Makers of Modern Strategy from Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age -- Much like Heuser but by multiple authors, less integrated, and more disjoint. Not worse, not better, but should be kept on-hand.

	Gunpowder Age by Tonio Andrade -- Reading it will give you a sense of strategy being more about preparing to take advantage of good luck, and preparing to blunt the impact of very bad luck.

	Philosophers of the Warring States by Kurtis Hagen -- Not directly about strategy, but that is very fitting because most of the crucial prerequisites for good strategy, don't \_look\_ like strategy. They are background phenomena -- culture and habits and view-points -- that influence what kinds of strategies we can actually manifest. Strategy is not a thing that you sit down and do, it is a superior point of view, or superior interpretation of your context.

	Game Theory 101: Bargaining by William Spaniel -- Great book on the raw logic of bargaining. Also see his book about nuclear bargaining.

* 🟩 **[Signal-Court-4099](https://www.reddit.com/user/Signal-Court-4099)** ⬆️ 2 _(2023-04-12 14:00:29)_

	My short list of some of the most valuable books on strategy:

	“Strategic Advantage: How to Win in War, Business, and Life”  Surveys 87 master strategists from the time of Troy to today, distilling the “high-five” principles of strategic advantage for winning in competition and cooperation.

	“Sun Tzu: The Art of War”  The classic book on strategy with a focus on war that stimulated numerous books with applications of Sun Tzu’s thoughts for other fields. 

	“Strategy:  A History”  A large book detailing applications of strategy throughout the years. Pick and choose your areas of interest from a wide range of coverage.    

	“Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters” Focuses on nine sources of power, while developing not only the “what” you are trying to do but the “why” and the “how.”

	“Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works”   From Harvard Business Review Press, the advice of the former Chairman and CEO of Procter &amp; Gamble and a business school dean. 

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2021-07-22 18:24:51)_

	Book about strategy implementation and the role of capabilities in bridging the gap  between formulation and implementation. 

	3)) Playing To Win. By Lafley and Martin.

	How P&amp;G reinvented itself in an increasingly complicated context? Lafley is the former CEO under who leadership P&amp;G grew exponentially.

	4)) Contemporary Strategy Analysis by Robert Grant.

		The best part is the very objective ideas without that stalling that most business books brings. The manual also mention ways to develop tactics. The strategy behind it can be narually learned.

* 🟩 **[kennyfraser](https://www.reddit.com/user/kennyfraser)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-03-23 13:52:44)_

	The Living Company by Arie De Geus. A different view of the question. He looks at large companies that have survived long term (more than the average of 40 years). Then he asks why and comes back with ideas about learning and evolution that are more fundamental characteristics and culture than traditional strategy.
