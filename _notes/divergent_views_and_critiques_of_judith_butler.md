## Divergent views and critiques of Judith Butler

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1adu9he/divergent_views_and_critiques_of_judith_butler/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1adu9he/divergent_views_and_critiques_of_judith_butler/)

> I’ve been on kind of a Butler binge recently and have read their Gender Trouble and Undoing Gender. Being trans, both books left me awestruck and offered an altogether new way to view gender (as performativity). 
> 
> But now that I’ve read these books, I’m wondering what else can I read that approaches gender in the same way but perhaps offers a different theory of gender than Butler? Any critiques of Butler’s work would also be helpful.
> 
> I’m more interested in the psychology of gender and found the parts where they discuss Lacanian psychoanalysis particularly compelling.

	I really respect Martha Nussbaum who's an interesting scholar but her criticism of Butler is so off the mark that it's pretty painful to read at times. But anyway it was a rather heavily discussed piece [so there you go](https://newrepublic.com/article/150687/professor-parody), maybe you'll find some compelling arguments, maybe you'll stick to Butler even more ;-)

		Yeah I’ve read the critique and its…disgusting, to say the least. It kinda turned me off Nussbaum as a whole if all her feminism leads to unnecessary attacks like these. Any other suggestions?

		Jesus I just took a peak at this and it’s just bad/offered in bad faith. Nussbaum is by all means correct that Butler is a difficult writer, and frankly I would co-sign the label of “bad” writer, but Butler’s points are still readily apparent to someone willing to carefully read and who’s got a passing familiarity with the lineage Butler is working in. The two pull-quotes Nussbaum uses to show that Butler is *incoherent* simply don’t do that and offer clear propositions when you strip away all the bullshit dependent clauses; it’s worth noting, and Nussbaum should know, that such stylistic idiosyncrasies just aren’t surprising or out of place for a scholar of Hegel, Derrida and Lacan.
		
		I do also think Nussbaum is correct in pointing out the shortcomings of Foucauldian-Butlerian accounts almost entirely predicated on power and a fetishism of resistance; this is a well-trod line of criticism with regards to Foucault and I think it’s apropos for Butler too, but ultimately this piece shows the importance of how criticism is made and that when one gets bogged down in sniping and taking shots one loses the moral high ground that Nussbaum so resolutely believes she possesses.

			I would offer that Hegel and Lacan are FAR worse writers than Butler, I'm slogging through Ecrits at the moment and my recent encounters with Butler (I just reread Precarious Life and Frames of War in light of their writing after October 7th) have been incredibly smooth by conparison.

				I find Hegel easier to read than Butler. I don’t know why that is but my brain can’t get around Butler’s ridiculous sentence structures. But Lacan? Fuuuck the Ecrits, even when you know what he’s talking about it rough.

					With Hegel I feel like I can never be confident that what I understand from his writing is what he meant. I found Butler’s writing a lot clearer, and anyone familiar with Althusser, Lacan, and Foucault could easily read their work. Granted those are heavyweight thinkers but I think Butler does a decent job at using them to make their own point

						With Hegel the historical context is key. I thought I understood him and then I actually read a lot about the time period and his intellectual commitments. Now I feel like I have a pretty firm grasp on why he’s saying what he’s saying. Though I am far from any amount of expertise.

	Joan Copjec responded to Butler in her 1994 book Read My Desire. It is a fascinating book on Lacanian psychoanalysis. However, not all of it is aimed at what you are interested in, but the last essay Sex and the Euthanasia of Reason is a fantastic look at the Formulas of Sexuation, developed by Lacan in seminars 19 and 20. It really helped my understanding of Lacanian Sexuation. I am a bi man and my best friend is trans and we both get so much out of critically engaging with Lacanian notions of sex. Even Žižek, if you can get on to his level and understand what he is saying, is often very useful to think through with regards to this topic. Though, none of these people engage with trans topics directly, or if they do it is often stilted and the language is outdated, they are valuable interlocutors for understanding the complications implicit in the concept of sex. I will also second Gherovici, she works as a Lacanian analyst, yet she is often not working in the same bounds as others. She is reticent to accept the psychosis theory of trans subjectivity.

		Thank you for the suggestions! Didn’t know Zizek has written on sex and sexuality much. There are several videos of him on YouTube speaking against “transgenderism” and what sounds like the same ROGD stuff that’s been debunked a long time ago. But I’ve read and liked some of his work. Anything you’d recommend by him?

		* 🟧 **[Sam_the_caveman](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sam_the_caveman)** ⬆️ 5 _(2024-01-29 17:35:08)_

			Yeah he does have his boomer moments and I won’t try to defend them too much, except to say that in his writings, if you can get past his irreverent style (he is irreverent about everything, not just these issues) there is a lot he has to say that should be taken seriously. 
			
			He designates 3 main antagonisms/contradictions in reality: class, sex, and the inconsistency in the big Other. The latter he connects with Christianity. Sex and the Failed Absolute (2016?) is a more recent book that directly addresses the topic of sex — though he sprinkles it throughout his work — and it is a pretty systematic overview of his work. Another one from the 90’s is The Metastases of Enjoyment, I have not read it yet, but I know it does dialogue with Butler and Copjec, at least for the relevant parts. Another I haven’t read is Surplus Enjoyment from a few years ago, that one also does touch on sex from my understanding. All that said, very rarely do I read anything by Žižek that I feel isn’t connected with sex because it is so fundamental to his philosophy.

				That is an interesting take on Zizek, about his work being entrenched with notions of sex. Either way, thanks for the suggestions :)

					And just to be clear, he does not think of sex as a binary or necessarily related to biology, the formulas of sexuation are pretty clear on that, even though there re two positions they are not a binary. It’s very complicated but so it is with all the Lacanian nonsense. In many ways he’s actually very close to Butler, though definitely critical and has his own take on these matters.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 13 _(2024-01-29 08:11:22)_

	In sociology instead of Butler we primarily read West and Zimmerman 'Undoing Gender'. It's honestly not a very different theory and it's not a critique of Butler (it came before Butler) but it has some useful concepts like "sex category". It's basically  a similar argument as Butler but less political and basically from an ethnomethodological perspective, so it's grounded in a different theory of action, and a lot of the insights are in reference to Garfinkel's foundational piece about Agnes. I have an ethnomethodologist friend who insists ethnomethodology and Butler's theory have nothing in common but I honestly think that's a misreading that splits hairs unnecessarily (they seem to have an axe to grind against Butler lol).

	not for everybody, but Freud is a pretty indispensable resource on gender, imo. His idea of a "primary bisexuality", in my reading, implies that everyone is originally non-binary, and identifying solely with one gender or another is a kind of neurosis.

	Folks will probably disagree with me on this point, but it's all there in Five Essays on the Theory of Sexuality.

			Yes, her work is so important for anyone wanting to see psychoanalysis grapple with queerness and gender identity in an affirming and validating manner, which, it historically, has not.

	Analytic: Sally Haslanger's *Resisting Reality* is a good book but probably wrong about Butler. Quill Kukla is influenced by Butler and has some articles. Robin Dembroff is influenced by Haslanger, but I don't think his manuscript is out yet.

		Undoing Gender was fairly straightforward tbh, Butler really dumbs down their language and academic jargon there. But I may have this view because I read Gender Trouble first and relatively its a much easier read.
		
		Gender Trouble’s first chapter is a breeze but second chapter onwards gets *really* dense as they explore the connections between Lacanian psychoanalysis, Althusserian theory and gender. I have a background in philosophy so I could manage but someone entirely new to gender theory would probably really struggle

* 🟩 **[AHorseisHuman1966](https://www.reddit.com/user/AHorseisHuman1966)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-05-04 14:07:58)_

	If you don't read biological sex as determining self or identity - just as frequently determining poor or preferential treatment, which is the more traditional feminist argument about gender, then you don't need it erased.  I recommend you read Frederickson's objectification theory and then apply it to a body-self dichotomy.  That I believe would be more relevant than Butler to achievable trans rights and more relevant to how trans people may face violence and discrimination.
