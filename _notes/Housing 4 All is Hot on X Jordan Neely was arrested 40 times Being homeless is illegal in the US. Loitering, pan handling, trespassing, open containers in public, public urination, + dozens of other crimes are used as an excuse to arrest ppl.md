"Jordan Neely was arrested 40 times" Being homeless is illegal in the US. Loitering, pan handling, trespassing, open containers in public, public urination, + dozens of other crimes are used as an excuse to arrest ppl who don't have a place to live and public facilities to use.



A lot of people don't have criminal records until they become unhoused - or become unhoused after their first charge that keeps them from being able to find a place to live. Then they get more and more charges due to the nature of the criminalization of the poor + survival.

Even if he had 40 murder charges (which he didn't -because no one racks up 40 charges unless they're minor!!) he didn't deserve to get executed by a random person in a middle of a train for yelling about being hungry and thirsty.

Post War on Drugs + ending up with the largest prison population on earth - we should be well aware that a person's criminal history is not a good judgement of their character or their value. It's a reflection on how much police interaction they have- and unhoused ppl have a lot.

And he busked in subway, which is a few more reasons for cops to harass and arrest

He had an active assault charge.

Agreed. Nothing about Neely or his behavior in that moment remotely rose to the level of being an imminent threat justifying the use of lethal force in response. This debate should be focusing in on the Marine, not him.

The foundation allegedly submitted bogus invoices for work at a homeless shelter. The city attorney calls it ‘willful misconduct.’

So you're ok with all that?

Casually leaving out all the assault charges

And, from what I read, he had to testify against his mother’s boyfriend, because I believe he witnessed the bf strangle his mother to death He had mental health issues due to the life he was forced to endure as a child and then the horror that this is how this young man died

Everyone taking sides and arguing w each other when the real problem is the elected officials whose policies caused this mess. NY cut funding for mental health programs and their “light on crime” approach will continue to cause citizens to fight back [elizabethkelleylaw.com/mentaldisabili](https://t.co/cOr9nIeunB)

So are you advocating for a two-tier justice system? Or legalizing public drinking, public urination, trespassing?

Maybe it was because of the violent physical assaults? Many of which were caught on camera? Nah

Nah, it’s hard as hell to get arrested in NYC stop lying

Even the statement "he was arrested X # times" is useless on its face. The police arrest people all the time on invented issues. An arrest means nothing here.

He had an active assault charge on him for attacking an elderly person.

I still have yet to see someone say this and provide an actual source.

Jermaine spent four years incarcerated as a teen, and there he was again. Behind bars, he joined Prison Fellowship Academy® and surrendered his life to God. He got a second chance. Click to read how Jermaine went from lawbreaker to lawmaker of his town!

Honestly no one should even have to justify his arrests or his character, being arrested is not a capital offense and he didnt even do anything warranting a new arrest.
