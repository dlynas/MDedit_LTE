		I like to listen to him, but I do get a bit annoyed that he talks a lot about Netanyahu as the problem. Israel's problem is Zionism, and it started way before Netanyahu.

			It’s funny that this guys trusts Israel even though nothing they say has been independently verified and the actively prevent any sort of independent investigation but it’s so outrageous to him to believe Hamas numbers which have been proven to be relatively accurate in past conflicts

				I mean, Israel only told us a whole bunch of lies since the beginning of this thing, that were so blatant that even the internet just looked at them and said “nope”. To think they suddenly had a change in heart and decided to start telling the truth makes him one of the dumbest and most naive people on the planet.

				* 🟪 **[Unusual_Specialist58](https://www.reddit.com/user/Unusual_Specialist58)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-07 04:46:04)_

					I agree but unfortunately the propaganda machine is strong so there are people that will believe ANYTHING Israel claims

			If we're going to look past Netanyahu and get to the root of the problem, I say let's go all the way with it. There are two critically salient facts about this conflict, without which nothing useful is ever accomplished through talking, and I hear no one else insisting upon them.
			
			1. The October 7th attack was a military operation carried out upon [soldiers, not civilians,](https://archive.is/Uu2PV) and thus legal and valid according to all the laws and informal rules of war. It was equivalent to the Tet Offensive, not 9/11 (and I made that exact point on the very day it occurred). Hamas are not villains, they are not terrorists, they are in fact the only people in the entire world sacrificing their own lives on a daily basis in order to defend the civilian population of Gaza, first from a totalitarian occupation, and now from genocide. If that's not heroic, then what is?
			
			2. The Zionist project is inherently antisemitic on its face. Zionism posits that Jews are uniquely incapable of living among and alongside people of other nations, which is the very definition of antisemitism and has been the core contention of anti-Semites for thousands of years. The creation and maintenance of the artificial state of Israel is the single greatest threat to the safety of Jews worldwide, and it is only through the Diaspora that Jews have found and will continue to find lasting security, just like every other marginalized group of people existing everywhere else in the world. Israel is a colonial project akin to Liberia, and like Liberia, it is ultimately destined one way or another to be repatriated to its indigenous population, a fact which Netanyahu understands better than perhaps anyone else alive, and its prevention is the very reason he is carrying out a campaign of extermination. 
			
			As long as we agree to the bullshit make-believe rules of the colonizers, talking accomplishes nothing. Zionists begin every discussion by insisting upon two things: that you condemn Hamas and that you acknowledge that Israel has "a right to exist," as if any country enjoys such a fiction. This is meant to obscure the fact that **Palestinians have the right to defend themselves from the Zionists who are stealing their land**. Every discussion or debate about this issue must begin with that central fact and stay rooted upon it because it is the truth and it is absolutely unshakeable. Every other consideration is secondary and withers when set against it.

			If so, it would be the greatest mistake ever made. It would achieve the same result as the [Samson Option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Option) regardless of whether or not that plan is the one used.

			It is truly astonishing how rapidly they've descended from invincibility into incoherence. That's the most surprising element of all of this to me. It's like these aren't even the same people from ten years ago.

				And what about other issues in society?
				
				Are you a climate change affirmer? What if fixing the problem requires sending free labour to developing nations. Are you a climate change denier all of a sudden?

		In Israel, they consume propaganda 24/7. Their own propaganda has demonized Palestinians to such an extent that these people can't believe anyone would believe or trust anything a Palestinian would say. They think the rest of the world is like them, that all they need to say is the other side is Hamas and anything and everything is permitted cause Hamas is the most evil group in the entire world. Unfortunately this strategy has worked cause many western countries share and propagate the same propaganda that you see in Israel.

	* 🟨 **[Global_Bat_5541](https://www.reddit.com/user/Global_Bat_5541)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-07 16:35:02)_

		Because they think that will shut people up- they think people are afraid to be seen as pro hamas because they see them as terrorists. It's like calling everything they don't like antisemitism. They know people are afraid of being labeled as an antisemite so they throw it around in hopes it'll shut down reason

	The casualty figures from the Palestinian Health Authority have been used by the UN and US State Department.  In fact these are probably underestimates.  As Norman Finklestein has stated just stick to the facts and that is good enough to show up hasbarists with their pathetic excuses.

	* 🟨 **[GeshtiannaSG](https://www.reddit.com/user/GeshtiannaSG)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-07 02:39:17)_

		It’s easy to tell if the numbers are accurate. The health ministry lists out every person killed by name, just have to count them.

	* 🟨 **[Global_Bat_5541](https://www.reddit.com/user/Global_Bat_5541)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-07 16:37:08)_

		I believe I read that even Israel is accepting Palestinian health authority's casualty numbers now. Hasbara bots haven't caught up with this news I guess

	Until now, no one has argued with Israeli misinformation agents, one on one. They usually just show up on friendly outlets like Fox, Sky, Sun, CNN and BBC controlled by Zionist owners or management… say a bunch of nonsense and leave. It’s only now that they are scrambling and desperately trying to spread misinformation that they have to go on shows such as this…and we are seeing their propaganda skillfully dismantled. It’s about time!

	You don’t trust the figures. No. So we should send in journalists to verify the IDFs and the Palestinian health authorities figures. No. Why not? Because. But surely with all these claims your making about guns in pillowcases and the like they’d come across these and verify what you’re saying and support your point. Yes they would. So we should send them in then. No.

	If schools taught courses on propaganda all governments would crumble. It’s amazing to me that full adults like trevor don’t see that they’re using “whataboutism” tactics that have been provided to them by their own government and they brainlessly parrot it without second guessing the source it came from
