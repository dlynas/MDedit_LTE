## Yesterday @weareumaw posted this infographic (last slide) that spread widely without much scrutiny. It frustrated me because it ultimately works against the best interest of artists & benefits bots/Apple/Amazon. Wanted to share my thoughts on some economic systems before the dust settled.

Again, I donâ€™t think Spotify needs anyone coming to their defense - I have plenty of qualms with them (& most companies these days), but leaving Apple/Amazon out of this conversation is a mistake. Yes, Spotify operates at a loss, but Apple/Amazon Music use music as a LOSS LEADER - Apple Music helps sell iPhones, Amazon Music helps sell Prime - which should, in theory, give them the freedom to make meaningful changes.
