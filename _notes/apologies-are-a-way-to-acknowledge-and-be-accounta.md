## ⁣⁣Apologies are a way to acknowledge and be accountable for wrongdoings. You do not have to apologize, but it is favorable toward repairing broken expectations in a relationship. 

If you believe that you are not wrong, don't offer an apology to keep the peace. Apologies are best when they are meaningful. 
⁣⁣⁣⁣
The most significant error people make in apologizing is being defensive. ⁣⁣⁣⁣Acknowledge that you've wronged or hurt someone instead of trying to defend yourself. ⁣⁣Perhaps, you do have a legitimate defensive, but sharing your defensive when offending someone else is inappropriate. 
⁣⁣
The best apology is not repeating the same offense again and again.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
A genuine apology requires accountability and reasonable efforts to change. ⁣⁣
 
Hard truth: Some people will not apologize, and you will have to decide how you want to proceed when the other person is not acknowledging their actions.
