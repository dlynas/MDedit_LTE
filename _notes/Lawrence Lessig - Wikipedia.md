Interview with Lawrence Lessig in 2009

Lessig was born on June 3, 1961, in [Rapid City, South Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_City,_South_Dakota "Rapid City, South Dakota"). He graduated from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania "University of Pennsylvania") in 1983 with a double degree [BA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts "Bachelor of Arts") in [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics") and a [BS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science "Bachelor of Science") in management. He then studied [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") at [Trinity College, Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge "Trinity College, Cambridge"), receiving an [MA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin) "Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)") in 1986. Lessig then returned to the United States to attend law school. He did his first year at the [University of Chicago Law School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Law_School "University of Chicago Law School") before transferring to [Yale Law School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Law_School "Yale Law School"), graduating in 1989 with a [JD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor "Juris Doctor") degree.

After graduating from law school, Lessig was a [law clerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_clerk "Law clerk") for Judge [Richard Posner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Posner "Richard Posner") of the [US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Seventh_Circuit "United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit") from 1989 to 1990, and then for Justice [Antonin Scalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Scalia "Antonin Scalia") of the [US Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States "Supreme Court of the United States") from 1990 to 1991.<sup id="cite_ref-resume_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-resume-2">[2]</a></sup>

Lessig started his academic career at the [University of Chicago Law School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Law_School "University of Chicago Law School"), where he was professor from 1991 to 1997. As co-director of the Center for the Study of Constitutionalism in Eastern Europe there, he helped the newly independent [Republic of Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country) "Georgia (country)") draft a constitution.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> From 1997 to 2000, he was at [Harvard Law School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Law_School "Harvard Law School"), holding for a year the chair of Berkman Professor of Law, affiliated with the [Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkman_Klein_Center_for_Internet_%26_Society "Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society").<sup id="cite_ref-resume_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-resume-2">[2]</a></sup> He subsequently joined [Stanford Law School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Law_School "Stanford Law School"), where he established the school's [Center for Internet and Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Center_for_Internet_and_Society "Stanford Center for Internet and Society").<sup id="cite_ref-short-bio_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-short-bio-4">[4]</a></sup>

## Views\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Lessig&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Views")\]

Lessig is a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright"), [trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark "Trademark"), and [radio frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency "Radio frequency") spectrum, particularly in technology applications. In 2001, he founded [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons "Creative Commons"), a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon and to share legally. Prior to his most recent appointment at Harvard, he was a professor of law at [Stanford Law School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Law_School "Stanford Law School"), where he founded the [Center for Internet and Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Center_for_Internet_and_Society "Stanford Center for Internet and Society"), and at the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago "University of Chicago"). He is a former board member of the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation "Free Software Foundation") and [Software Freedom Law Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Freedom_Law_Center "Software Freedom Law Center"); the Washington, DC lobbying groups [Public Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Knowledge "Public Knowledge") and [Free Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Press_(organization) "Free Press (organization)"); and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation "Electronic Frontier Foundation").<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> He was elected to the [American Philosophical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Philosophical_Society "American Philosophical Society") in 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

As a political activist, Lessig has called for state-based activism to promote substantive reform of government with a [Second Constitutional Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Constitutional_Convention_of_the_United_States "Second Constitutional Convention of the United States").<sup id="cite_ref-twsNovQ11_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-twsNovQ11-10">[10]</a></sup> In May 2014, he launched a crowd-funded [political action committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee "Political action committee") which he termed [Mayday PAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayday_PAC "Mayday PAC") with the purpose of electing candidates to [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") who would pass [campaign finance reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_reform_in_the_United_States "Campaign finance reform in the United States").<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Lessig is also the co-founder of [Rootstrikers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers "Rootstrikers"), and is on the boards of [MapLight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapLight "MapLight") and [Represent.Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Represent.Us "Represent.Us").<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> He serves on the advisory boards of the _Democracy Café_<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> and the [Sunlight Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight_Foundation "Sunlight Foundation").<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

In August 2015, Lessig announced that he was exploring a possible candidacy for President of the United States, promising to run if his exploratory committee raised $1 million by [Labor Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day "Labor Day").<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-why_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-why-16">[16]</a></sup> After accomplishing this, on September 6, 2015, Lessig announced that he was entering the race [to become a candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig_presidential_campaign,_2016 "Lawrence Lessig presidential campaign, 2016") for the 2016 [Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)")'s [presidential nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_candidates,_2016 "Democratic Party presidential candidates, 2016").<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Lessig described his candidacy as a referendum on [campaign finance reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_reform_in_the_United_States "Campaign finance reform in the United States") and [electoral reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_reform "Electoral reform") legislation.

Lessig speaking with Harvard internet law professor [Jonathan Zittrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Zittrain "Jonathan Zittrain")

Lessig has been politically [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States "Liberalism in the United States") since studying philosophy at Cambridge in the mid-1980s. By the late 1980s, two influential [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism "Conservatism") judges, Judge [Richard Posner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Posner "Richard Posner") and Justice [Antonin Scalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Scalia "Antonin Scalia"), selected him to serve as a [law clerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_clerk "Law clerk"), choosing him because they considered him brilliant rather than for his ideology and effectively making him the "token liberal" on their staffs.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Posner would later call him "the most distinguished law professor of his generation."<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

Lessig has emphasized in interviews that his philosophy experience at [Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge") radically changed his values and career path. Previously, he had held strong conservative or [libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism "Libertarianism") political views, desired a career in business, was a highly active member of [Teenage Republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Republicans "Teenage Republicans"), served as the youth governor for Pennsylvania through the [YMCA Youth and Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA_Youth_and_Government "YMCA Youth and Government") program<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> in 1978, and almost pursued a [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)") political career.

What was intended to be a year abroad at Cambridge convinced him instead to stay another two years to complete an undergraduate degree in philosophy and develop his changed political values. During this time, he also traveled in the [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc "Eastern Bloc"), where he acquired a lifelong interest in [Eastern European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe "Eastern Europe") law and politics.

Lessig remains skeptical of government intervention but favors some regulation, calling himself "a constitutionalist." On one occasion, Lessig also commended the [John McCain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain "John McCain") campaign for discussing [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use "Fair use") rights in a letter to [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube "YouTube") where it took issue with YouTube for indulging overreaching copyright claims leading to the removal of various campaign videos.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

## Internet and computer activism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Lessig&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Internet and computer activism")\]

### "Code is law"\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Lessig&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: "Code is law"")\]

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), "code" typically refers to the text of a computer program (the [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code")). In law, "code" can refer to the texts that constitute [statutory law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_law "Statutory law"). In his 1999 book _[Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_and_Other_Laws_of_Cyberspace "Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace")_, Lessig explores the ways in which code in both senses can be instruments for [social control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_control "Social control"), leading to his dictum that "Code is law." Lessig later updated his work in order to keep up with the prevailing views of the time and released the book as _[Code: Version 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:_Version_2.0 "Code: Version 2.0")_ in December 2006.

### Remix culture\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Lessig&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Remix culture")\]

Lessig has been a proponent of the [remix culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_culture "Remix culture") since the early 2000s.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> In his 2008 book [_Remix_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix_(book) "Remix (book)")<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> he presents this as a desirable cultural practice distinct from piracy. Lessig further articulates remix culture as intrinsic to technology and the Internet. Remix culture is therefore an amalgam of practice, creativity, "read/write" culture and the hybrid economy.

According to Lessig, the problem with the remix comes when it is at odds with stringent US copyright law. He has compared this to the failure of [Prohibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States "Prohibition in the United States"), both in its ineffectiveness and in its tendency to normalize criminal behavior. Instead he proposes more lenient licensing, namely [Creative Commons licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license "Creative Commons license"), as a remedy to maintain "rule of law" while combating plagiarism.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

### Free culture\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Lessig&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Free culture")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Aaron_Swartz_and_Lawrence_Lessig.jpg/220px-Aaron_Swartz_and_Lawrence_Lessig.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aaron_Swartz_and_Lawrence_Lessig.jpg)

Lessig and [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz "Aaron Swartz") in 2002 at the launch party for [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons "Creative Commons")

On March 28, 2004 Lessig was elected to the FSF's board of directors.<sup id="cite_ref-Fsf.org_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-Fsf.org-29">[29]</a></sup> He proposed the concept of "[free culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-culture_movement "Free-culture movement")".<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> He also supports [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "Free and open-source software") and [open spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_spectrum "Open spectrum").<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> At his free culture keynote at the [O'Reilly Open Source Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Open_Source_Convention "O'Reilly Open Source Convention") 2002, a few minutes of his speech was about [software patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent "Software patent"),<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> which he views as a rising threat to [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software"), [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software "Open source software") and innovation.

In March 2006, Lessig joined the board of advisors of the [Digital Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Universe "Digital Universe") project.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> A few months later, Lessig gave a talk on the ethics of the Free Culture Movement at the 2006 [Wikimania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimania "Wikimania") conference. In December 2006, his lecture _On Free, and the Differences between Culture and Code_ was one of the highlights at [23C3 _Who can you trust?_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress "Chaos Communication Congress").<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

Lessig claimed in 2009 that, because 70 percent of young people obtain digital information from illegal sources, the law should be changed.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

In a foreword to the [Freesouls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freesouls "Freesouls") book project, Lessig makes an argument in favor of amateur artists in the world of digital technologies: "there is a different class of amateur creators that digital technologies have ... enabled, and a different kind of creativity has emerged as a consequence."<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

Lessig is also a well-known critic of [copyright term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_term "Copyright term") extensions.

### Net neutrality\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Lessig&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Net neutrality")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Lessig-Wales-20070615.jpg/220px-Lessig-Wales-20070615.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lessig-Wales-20070615.jpg)

Lessig and [Jimmy Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales "Jimmy Wales") at the iCommons iSummit07 in [Dubrovnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik "Dubrovnik")

Lessig has long been known to be a supporter of [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality "Net neutrality"). In 2006, he testified before the US Senate that he believed Congress should ratify [Michael Powell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Powell_(attorney) "Michael Powell (attorney)")'s four Internet freedoms and add a restriction to access-tiering, i.e. he does not believe content providers should be charged different amounts. The reason is that the Internet, under the neutral end-to-end design is an invaluable platform for innovation, and the economic benefit of innovation would be threatened if large corporations could purchase faster service to the detriment of newer companies with less capital. However, Lessig has supported the idea of allowing ISPs to give consumers the option of different tiers of service at different prices. He was reported on CBC News as saying that he has always been in favour of allowing internet providers to charge differently for consumer access at different speeds. He said, "Now, no doubt, my position might be wrong. Some friends in the network neutrality movement as well as some scholars believe it is wrong—that it doesn't go far enough. But the suggestion that the position is 'recent' is baseless. If I'm wrong, I've always been wrong."<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

### Legislative reform\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Lessig&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Legislative reform")\]

Despite presenting an anti-regulatory standpoint in many fora, Lessig still sees the need for legislative enforcement of copyright. He has called for limiting copyright terms for creative professionals to five years, but believes that creative professionals' work, many of them independent, would become more easily and quickly available if bureaucratic procedure were introduced to renew trademarks for up to 75 years after this five-year term.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> Lessig has repeatedly taken a stance that privatization through legislation like that seen in the 1980s in the UK with British Telecommunications is not the best way to help the Internet grow. He said, "When government disappears, it's not as if paradise will take its place.

From 1999 to 2002, Lessig represented a high-profile challenge to the [Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Bono_Copyright_Term_Extension_Act "Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act"). Working with the [Berkman Center for Internet and Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkman_Center_for_Internet_and_Society "Berkman Center for Internet and Society"), Lessig led the team representing the plaintiff in _[Eldred v. Ashcroft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft "Eldred v. Ashcroft")_.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> The plaintiff in the case was joined by a group of publishers who frequently published work in the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain_in_the_United_States "Public domain in the United States") and a large number of _[amici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae "Amicus curiae")_ including the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation "Free Software Foundation"), the [American Association of Law Libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Association_of_Law_Libraries "American Association of Law Libraries"), the [Bureau of National Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_National_Affairs "Bureau of National Affairs"), and the [College Art Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Art_Association "College Art Association").

In March 2003, Lessig acknowledged severe disappointment with his Supreme Court defeat in the Eldred copyright-extension case, where he unsuccessfully tried to convince Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who had sympathies for de-regulation, to back his "market-based" approach to intellectual property regulation.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>

### _Killswitch_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Lessig&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Killswitch")\]

In October 2014, _Killswitch_, a film featuring Lawrence Lessig, as well as [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz "Aaron Swartz"), [Tim Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Wu "Tim Wu"), and [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden "Edward Snowden") received its World Premiere at the [Woodstock Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_Film_Festival "Woodstock Film Festival"), where it won the award for Best Editing. In the film, Lessig frames the story of two young hacktivists, Swartz and Snowden, who symbolize the disruptive and dynamic nature of the Internet. The film reveals the emotional bond between Lessig and Swartz, and how it was Swartz (the mentee) that challenged Lessig (the mentor) to engage in the political activism that has led to Lessig's crusade for [campaign finance reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_reform_in_the_United_States "Campaign finance reform in the United States").<sup id="cite_ref-metro_51-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-metro-51">[51]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ocreg_52-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-ocreg-52">[52]</a></sup>

In February 2015, _Killswitch_ was invited to screen at the Capitol Visitor's Center in Washington, DC, by Congressman [Alan Grayson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Grayson "Alan Grayson"). The event was held on the eve of the Federal Communications Commission's historic decision on [Net Neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Neutrality "Net Neutrality"). Lessig, Congressman Grayson, and [Free Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Press_(organization) "Free Press (organization)") CEO Craig Aaron spoke about the importance of protecting net neutrality and the free and open Internet.<sup id="cite_ref-house1_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-house1-53">[53]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>

Director Ali Akbarzadeh, producer Jeff Horn, and writer Chris Dollar created a human centered story.

### Rootstrikers\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Lessig&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Rootstrikers")\]

Despite having decided to forgo running for Congress himself, Lessig remained interested in attempting to change Congress to reduce corruption.<sup id="cite_ref-blog-notrunning_62-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-blog-notrunning-62">[62]</a></sup> To this end, he worked with political consultant [Joe Trippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Trippi "Joe Trippi") to launch a web based project called "[Change Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_Congress "Change Congress")".<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> In a press conference on March 20, 2008, Lessig explained that he hoped the Change Congress website would help provide technological tools voters could use to hold their representatives accountable and reduce the influence of money on politics.<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> He is a board member of [MAPLight.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAPLight.org "MAPLight.org"), a nonprofit research group illuminating the connection between money and politics.

## Electoral College reform\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Lessig&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Electoral College reform")\]

In 2017, Lessig announced a movement to challenge the [winner-take-all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting_system "Plurality voting system") [Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States) "Electoral College (United States)") vote allocation in the various states, called _[Equal Votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Citizens#Equal_Votes "Equal Citizens")_.<sup id="cite_ref-to171005_85-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-to171005-85">[85]</a></sup> Lessig was also a counsel for electors in the Supreme Court case _[Chiafalo v. Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiafalo_v._Washington "Chiafalo v. Washington")_ where the court decided states could force electors to follow the state's popular vote.

In 2023, Lessig wrote an editorial in _[Slate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine) "Slate (magazine)")_ suggesting that the electoral college should be the body that decides whether [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") engaged in insurrection under the U.S. Constitution. He explained that it was better "that the college called into being for the sole purpose of selecting a president decide the matter than for sitting politicians or state officials."<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>

### Defamation lawsuit against _The New York Times_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lawrence_Lessig&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Defamation lawsuit against The New York Times")\]

In 2019, during the criminal investigation of [Jeffrey Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein "Jeffrey Epstein"), it was discovered that the [MIT Media Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab "MIT Media Lab"), under former director [Joichi Ito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joichi_Ito "Joichi Ito"), had accepted secret donations from Epstein after Epstein had been convicted on criminal charges. Ito eventually resigned as director of the [MIT Media Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Media_Lab "MIT Media Lab") following this discovery. After making supportive comments to Ito, Lessig wrote a [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website) "Medium (website)") post in September 2019 to explain his stance. In his post, Lessig acknowledged that universities should not take donations from convicted criminals like Epstein who had become wealthy through actions unrelated to their criminal convictions; however, if such donations were to be accepted, it was better to take them secretly rather than publicly connect the university to the criminal.<sup id="cite_ref-101"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup> Lessig's essay drew criticism, and about a week later, [Nellie Bowles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellie_Bowles "Nellie Bowles") of _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_ had an interview with Lessig in which he reiterated his stance related to such donations broadly.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup> The article used the headline "A Harvard Professor Doubles Down: If You Take Epstein’s Money, Do It in Secret", which Lessig confirmed was based on a statement he had made to the _Times_. Lessig took issue with the headline overlooking his argument that MIT should not accept such donations in the first place and also criticized the first two lines of the article which read "It is hard to defend soliciting donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law professor, has been trying." He subsequently accused the _Times_ of writing [clickbait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait "Clickbait") with the headline crafted to defame him, and stated that the circulation of the article on social media had hurt his reputation.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (January 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In January 2020, Lessig filed a defamation lawsuit against the _Times_, including writer Bowles, business editor Ellen Pollock, and executive editor Dean Baquet. The _Times_ stated they will "vigorously" defend against Lessig's claim, and believe that what they had published was accurate and had been reviewed by senior editors following Lessig's initial complaints.<sup id="cite_ref-104"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup>

In April 2020, _The New York Times_ changed its original headline to read: "What Are the Ethics of Taking Tainted Funds? A conversation with Lawrence Lessig about Jeffrey Epstein, M.I.T. and reputation laundering."<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup> Lessig reported he subsequently withdrew his defamation lawsuit.<sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup>
