## Surprised they aired this much truth on a Fox affiliate.

"Some breaking news on the campus of the University of Chicago campus.
Please they're breaking up a protester encampment police in riot gear arrived on campus early this morning.
Johnny has been there very early.
She has the latest.
Johnny what has unfolded since you arrived?
Well, the campus police says you said moved in just for five a.m.
And these protesters have been holding a line now for two hours.
There's a bullhorn behind us.
So it's very loud.
Chris was on the inside when it happened to describe what happened in the
triad in the quadrant of this morning.
Yeah, it was horrific.
They waited like hours until every single student was asleep in their tent
basically.
And then they stormed in maybe 40 or 50 of them with riot gear gear screaming.
They started throwing wood, playing throwing chairs throwing absolutely
everything in any direction to destroy the campus fastest possible to
suppress this movement as fast as possible.
And in fact, one of the chairs that they threw came within maybe three
inches of hitting my girlfriend in the head.
And they had just woke us up.
It was dark because it was four skies.
You had a warning.
They were coming.
But they did for a while.
It was a warning.
No, we had no more.
Then what did you do when that all that happened?
I tried to make sure everyone was safe.
I mean, it was chaos.
It was terrifying.
Yeah.
So you were able to get out.
I understand that students are being threatened with disciplinary action for
being in there.
They gave us some ridiculous notice out here saying that like participants in
the Quad encampment, which no longer exist, thanks to them, are facing like an
interim leave of absence as well as a criminal trespass charge.
I have no idea if that's just a scare-tactor, but it's real, but it doesn't
matter because the difference between us and people like these cops is that
there are limits to when we continue following orders.
And when you're talking about a genocide, visited upon a colonized population of two
million people trapped in a ghetto that's as long as a marathon and six miles wide.
When that ghetto is being systematically starved, slaughtered, every hospital
bond, every university bond, 70% of home destroyed.
40,000 people murdered, 15,000 children murdered.
The entire population on the brink of starvation, we say, and if our government and our academic
institutions are complicit in this, that comes a point where we say we're not following
orders and it doesn't matter what you do to us.
It's because there are principles and there are human lives that matter more than our
careers and our futures.
And that's what separates us from people like Paul, all of you saw those, the coward
president of this university and these coward cops that come in terrorizing and incantrable
people are sleeping.
You've been standing at this line linked to arm and arm with other protesters.
What has happened here?
What's happening here?
You'd have to ask them.
Apparently they're trying to intimidate us, trying to suppress the protest that is continuing
to grow.
I think that they thought they could basically terrify us into inaction, into flight.
But this is what this university has never understood, has never accepted, has never reckoned
with about this student movement.
And not just at UChicago but around the country is that the commitment to Gaza runs deeper
than fears for our safety, fears for our careers, fears for our paychecks.
It is a fundamental obligation we have as citizens of a country that is presiding over
this genocide, forming this genocide, and as students at a university that is invested
in those same weapons manufacturers and that is partnered with the same, a part-site institutions
that train that military and develop its technology.
There was some pushing and shoving.
I don't know who was pushing or shoving but I know that there was tension here in the
line.
You tried to have a conversation with some of these police officers.
Yeah, I've been talking to them this whole time.
I've been asking them what it would take for them to stop following orders.
I would ask them how many kids have to die.
So if you say 15,000 kids are killed, they're still willing to violently suppress a national
movement raising the alarm that this needs to stop, that the US complicity needs to stop.
So what if it was 50,000 kids?
200,000 kids, a million kids.
What if the whole Gaza ghetto?
No, there are next steps here.
For them?
For me, where the next step is a simple one, whatever form it takes, which is to continue
fighting with every breath we have, with everything we have, for the people of Gaza because
the blood of those kids is on our hands.
It's on all of our hands, whether we like it or not.
If we're US citizens, if we're US Chicago students, we are implicated in this poor that is
being visited with total impunity because of US security council vetoes.
By the state of Israel.
I'm a student yet, so I'm a PhD student.
Again, I don't care.
It doesn't matter.
There are things that matter more than my academic future.
And certainly, everyone of those children that is being murdered, star, maim, whose parents
are having to choose, do I let this kid star first or that one?
This is such an ugly reality, such great magnitude, to even think, to really entertain questions
about like, oh, what might happen if Paul puts me on a leave of absence?
It's ridiculous.
And it's insulting to the memory of every child that has been murdered in the course
of this genocide with the full complicity of the United States of Joe Biden and of people
like the Olivia Salto and his cocks that he sticks on us in the middle of the night.
They're hypocrites, they're cowards, and the blood of Gaza's kids is on their hands too.
The different ancient enemies that we know that, and we reckon with it because we have
a duty to them.
Well, they hide from the truth.
And they won't even admit that a single university has been bombed.
Thank you so much."
