## Is the American home-owning dream dead?

According to the majority of renters surveyed in a new poll, the answer is yes.

The poll, conducted by the Harris Poll Thought Leadership and Future Practice and shared exclusively with the Guardian, asked survey takers to identify themselves as renters or homeowners, along with other demographic information.

Those polled were asked their opinion on home ownership in the United States. For many, especially renters, the outlook is bleak.

Though the vast majority of renters polled said they want to own a home in the future, 61% said they are worried they will never be able to. A similar percentage believe no matter how hard they work, they’ll never be able to afford a home.

“The implications on consumer psyche when things feel so unaffordable is something that will impact everyone,” said Libby Rodney, chief strategy officer at Harris Poll. The American dream of owning a home “is looking more like a daydream for renters”.

The state of the US housing market underlines just how difficult the situation has become. Redfin estimates only 16% of home listings in 2023 were affordable to the typical US household. In comparison, 50% of listings in 2013 were affordable on a median income.
