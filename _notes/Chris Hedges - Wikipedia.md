### Early career [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Early career")

Hedges gained an interest in pursuing journalism as a means of furthering ministry after a period of close communications with British journalist [Robert Cox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cox_(journalist) "Robert Cox (journalist)"), who was at that time reporting on the [Dirty War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_War "Dirty War") in [Argentina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina").

Hedges made some freelance contributions for _[The Washington Post](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post")_,<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> and later covered the [Falklands War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War "Falklands War") from Buenos Aires for [National Public Radio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR "NPR") using equipment given to him by NPR reporter [William Buzenberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Buzenberg "William Buzenberg"). Hedges returned to the United States to complete a [Master of Divinity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Divinity "Master of Divinity") degree at Harvard in 1983.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

Hedges continued his career as a freelance journalist in Latin America. From 1983 to 1984, he covered the conflicts in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala for _[The Christian Science Monitor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christian_Science_Monitor "The Christian Science Monitor")_ and NPR.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> He was hired as the Central America Bureau Chief for _[The Dallas Morning News](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News "The Dallas Morning News")_ in 1984 and held this position until 1988.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> [Noam Chomsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky") wrote of Hedges at the time that he was one of the "few US journalists in Central America who merit the title."<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

## _The New York Times_ [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: The New York Times")

In 1990, Hedges was hired by _The New York Times_. He covered the first [Gulf War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War "Gulf War") for the paper, where he refused to participate in the military pool system that restricted the movement and reporting of journalists.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_18-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:2-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> He was arrested by the [United States Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "United States Army") and had his press credentials revoked, but continued to defy the military restrictions to report outside the pool system. Hedges subsequently entered Kuwait with [U.S. Marine Corps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps "United States Marine Corps") members who were distrustful of the Army's press control. Within _The New York Times_, [R.W. Apple Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._W._Apple_Jr. "R. W. Apple Jr.") supported Hedges' defiance of the pool system.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_18-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:2-18">[18]</a></sup>

Hedges, along with [Neal Conan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Conan "Neal Conan"), was taken prisoner in [Basra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basra "Basra") after the war by the [Iraqi Republican Guard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Guard_(Iraq) "Republican Guard (Iraq)") during the Shiite uprising.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> He was freed after a week. Hedges was appointed the paper's Middle East Bureau Chief in 1991. His reporting on the atrocities committed by [Saddam Hussein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein "Saddam Hussein") in the Kurdish-held parts of northern Iraq saw the Iraqi leader offer a bounty for anyone who killed Hedges, along with other western journalists and aid workers in the region. Several aid workers and journalists, including the German reporter Lissy Schmidt, were assassinated and others were severely wounded.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

### Yugoslav Wars (1995–2000) [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Yugoslav Wars (1995–2000)")

In 1995, Hedges was named the Balkan Bureau Chief for _The New York Times_. He was based in Sarajevo when the city was being hit by over 300 shells a day by the surrounding Bosnia Serbs.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> He reported on the [Srebrenica massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre "Srebrenica massacre") in July 1995 and shortly after the war uncovered what appeared to be one of the central collection points and hiding places for perhaps thousands of corpses at the large open pit Ljubija mine during the [Bosnian Serbs' ethnic cleansing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing_in_the_Bosnian_War "Ethnic cleansing in the Bosnian War") campaign.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> He and the photographer Wade Goddard were the first reporters to travel with armed units of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in Kosovo.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> Hedges investigative piece was published in _The New York Times_ in June 1999 detailing how [Hashim Thaçi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashim_Tha%C3%A7i "Hashim Thaçi"), leader of the [Kosovo Liberation Army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_Liberation_Army "Kosovo Liberation Army") (and later president of Kosovo), directed a campaign in which as many as half a dozen top rebel commanders were assassinated and many others were brutally purged to consolidate his power.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Thaci, indicted by the special court in [The Hague](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague "The Hague") on 10 counts of war crimes, is in detention in The Hague awaiting trial.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

Hedges was a [Nieman Fellow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieman_Fellowship "Nieman Fellowship") at Harvard University during the 1998–1999 academic year, and chose to study [Latin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin") because of his prior interest in the [classics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics "Classics") from studying Classical Greek.<sup id="cite_ref-:11_8-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:11-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

Hedges ended his career of reporting in active conflicts in October 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_6-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:1-6">[6]</a></sup>

#### Reporting from coached defectors [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Reporting from coached defectors")

In a collaboration between _The New York Times_ and _[Frontline](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontline_(American_TV_program) "Frontline (American TV program)")_,<sup id="cite_ref-:4_34-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:4-34">[34]</a></sup> Hedges authored three articles covering the claims of false Iraqi defectors. Hedges worked on behalf of [Lowell Bergman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Bergman "Lowell Bergman") of _Frontline_, who could not travel to Beirut to interview the purported defectors. The trip was organized by [Ahmed Chalabi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Chalabi "Ahmed Chalabi"), whom Hedges considered to be unreliable. The first defector Hedges interviewed identified himself as Lt. General Jamal al-Ghurairy. Hedges consulted the U.S. Embassy in Turkey to confirm that identity, and the embassy falsely did so<sup id="cite_ref-heroes_in_error_35-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-heroes_in_error-35">[35]</a></sup> as the real al-Ghurairy had never left Iraq.

Hedges wrote a November 8, 2001 _Times_ cover story about two former Iraqi military commanders who claimed to have [trained foreign mujahedeen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein_and_al-Qaeda_link_allegations "Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations") how to hijack planes<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> and destroy vital American infrastructure. The two defectors also asserted there was a secret compound in [Salman Pak facility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Pak_facility "Salman Pak facility") where a German scientist was producing biological weapons.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> The _Frontline_ report featured statements from American officials who doubted the claims of the defectors.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_34-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:4-34">[34]</a></sup>

Conservative outlets referenced the articles in justifying the invasion of Iraq.<sup id="cite_ref-heroes_in_error_35-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-heroes_in_error-35">[35]</a></sup> In the aftermath of the revelations that the Iraqi defectors were not legitimate, Hedges defended his comportment since he had done the story as a favor to Lowell Bergman, adding that "There has to be a level of trust between reporters. We cover each other's sources when it's a good story because otherwise everyone would get hold of it."<sup id="cite_ref-heroes_in_error_35-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-heroes_in_error-35">[35]</a></sup>

### Exit from the _Times_ [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Exit from the Times")

In 2003, Hedges gave a commencement speech at the graduation ceremony for [Rockford College](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockford_University "Rockford University") in which he criticized the ongoing [American invasion of Iraq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq "2003 invasion of Iraq").<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> His speech was received with boos, and his microphone was shut off three minutes after he began speaking.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:9_40-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:9-40">[40]</a></sup> Hedges had to end the commencement speech short because of the various student disruptions,<sup id="cite_ref-:10_41-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:10-41">[41]</a></sup> which included an additional microphone cut, foghorns,<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> and chants of "God Bless America."<sup id="cite_ref-:9_40-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:9-40">[40]</a></sup>

_The New York Times_ criticized Hedges' statements and issued him a formal reprimand for "public remarks that could undermine public trust in the paper's impartiality". Hedges cited this reprimand as a motivation for resigning from the _Times_ in 2005.<sup id="cite_ref-dallas_43-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-dallas-43">[43]</a></sup> In 2013 he said "Either I muzzled myself to pay fealty to my career, which on a personal sense would be to betray my father, or I spoke out and realized that my relationship with my employer was terminal. And so at that point I left before they got rid of me. But I knew that, you know, I wasn't going to be able to stay".<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>

During the uncertainty following the loss of employment, Hedges was looking for posts to teach [high school](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school "Secondary school") English classes.<sup id="cite_ref-:8_45-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:8-45">[45]</a></sup> In a 2008 interview, Hedges acknowledged that he ultimately had not struggled, adding that "every year since I left the _Times_, I've made at least twice the salary I made at the paper. So, in a way, I didn't pay for it. And I have maintained what is most valuable to me, which is my integrity and my voice."<sup id="cite_ref-:7_1-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:7-1">[1]</a></sup>

Hedges produced a weekly column in [Truthdig](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthdig "Truthdig") for 14 years. He was fired along with all of the editorial staff in March 2020.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> Hedges and the staff had gone on strike earlier in the month to protest the publisher's attempt to fire the Editor-in-Chief [Robert Scheer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Scheer "Robert Scheer"), demand an end to a series of unfair labor practices and the right to form a union.<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> Hedges resumed work with Scheer after the launch of _Scheerpost_.

In June 2014, Christopher Ketcham published an article on _[The New Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic "The New Republic")_ website accusing Hedges of plagiarism in several Truthdig columns and a 2010 _[Harper's Magazine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper%27s_Magazine "Harper's Magazine")_ article.<sup id="cite_ref-Ketcham_50-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-Ketcham-50">[50]</a></sup> The Truthdig posts were updated to give attribution to their author,<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> and the _Harper's_ article was withdrawn.<sup id="cite_ref-Ketcham_50-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-Ketcham-50">[50]</a></sup>

### Ordination and ministerial installation [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Ordination and ministerial installation")

On October 5, 2014, Hedges was ordained a [minister](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(Christianity) "Minister (Christianity)") within the [Presbyterian Church](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian_Church_(U.S.A.) "Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)").

Hedges began hosting the television show _On Contact_ for the Russian-government owned network [RT America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_America "RT America") in June 2016. Hedges, who has claimed not to have known much about the network at the time, was approached to make a show by RT America president Mikhail "Misha" Solodovnikov, who promised him complete editorial independence.<sup id="cite_ref-:8_45-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:8-45">[45]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup>

_On Contact_ provided commentary on social issues, often profiling nonfiction authors and their recently published works with Hedges aiming to follow the approach of former public television shows. _On Contact_ was nominated for an [Emmy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards "Emmy Awards") in 2017, RT America's first significant award nomination, but the award was won by [_Steve_](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_(talk_show) "Steve (talk show)").<sup id="cite_ref-:8_45-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:8-45">[45]</a></sup>

On March 3, 2022, RT America ceased operations following the widespread deplatforming of Russian-sponsored media caused by the [2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine").<sup id="cite_ref-:8_45-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:8-45">[45]</a></sup> The run of _On Contact_ ended.

Hedges said he "might have paid with" his job for making negative comments about the war in Ukraine, "but at least for those six days", after the invasion, he remained in post.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Stay_on_topic" title="Wikipedia:Writing better articles"><span title="The material near this tag may contain information that is not relevant to the article's main topic.

### Chris Hedges Report (2022– ) [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Chris Hedges Report (2022– )")

Hedges, in collaboration with [The Real News Network](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_News_Network "The Real News Network"), began production in April 2022 for his current web series _The Chris Hedges Report_.<sup id="cite_ref-Report_2-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-Report-2">[2]</a></sup>

### Activism and direct involvement with politics [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Activism and direct involvement with politics")

In the [2008 United States presidential campaign](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_campaign "2008 United States presidential campaign"), Hedges was a speech writer for candidate [Ralph Nader](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader "Ralph Nader").<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> Hedges supported Green Party candidate [Jill Stein](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Stein "Jill Stein") in the 2016 election.<sup id="cite_ref-:8_45-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-:8-45">[45]</a></sup>

On April 15, 2016, Hedges was arrested, along with 100 other protesters, during a sit-in outside the [Capitol building](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol "United States Capitol") in Washington, D.C., during [Democracy Spring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Spring "Democracy Spring") to protest corporate political influence.<sup id="cite_ref-61"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup>

On May 27, 2020, Hedges announced that he would run as a [Green Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_the_United_States "Green Party of the United States") candidate in [New Jersey's 12th congressional district](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey%27s_12th_congressional_district "New Jersey's 12th congressional district") for the [2020 elections](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_New_Jersey "2020 United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey"). After being informed the following day that running for office would conflict with [FCC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission "Federal Communications Commission") [fairness doctrine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine "FCC fairness doctrine") rules because he was at that time hosting the nationally broadcast RT America television show _On Contact_, Hedges decided not to pursue office in order to keep hosting the show.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup>

## Political views [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Political views")

> Class struggle defines most of human history. Marx got this right. It is not a new story. The rich, throughout history, have found ways to subjugate and re-subjugate the masses. And the masses, throughout history, have cyclically awoken to throw off their chains.

—Chris Hedges "America's New Class War", _Scheerpost_, January 18, 2022<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>

Hedges has described himself as a [socialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist "Socialist")<sup id="cite_ref-67"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> and an [anarchist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism").<sup id="cite_ref-68"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> His books _[Death of the Liberal Class](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_the_Liberal_Class "Death of the Liberal Class")_ and _[Empire of Illusion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Illusion "Empire of Illusion")_ are strongly critical of [American liberalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_the_United_States "Liberalism in the United States").

Hedges' 2007 book _[American Fascists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Fascists "American Fascists")_ describes the [fundamentalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_fundamentalism "Christian fundamentalism") [Christian right](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right "Christian right") in the United States as a [fascist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism "Fascism") movement. In March 2008, Hedges published the book _I Don't Believe in Atheists_, in which he argues that [new atheism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atheism "New Atheism") presents a danger that is similar to religious extremism.<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup>

### Russian invasion of Ukraine [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Russian invasion of Ukraine")

In March 2022, Hedges condemned Russia's aggression as criminal and criticized [NATO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO")'s expansion as a dangerous and predictable provocation that baited Russia to initiate a conflict. Hedges called for Russia's withdrawal, an immediate ceasefire and moratorium on arms shipments to Ukraine.<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> He later stated that the invasion was "set to become a lengthy war of attrition, one funded and backed by an increasingly bellicose United States."<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> Hedges criticized the $40 billion aid package for Ukraine in a May 2022 piece, which he says demonstrates that the United States is "trapped in the death spiral of unchecked militarism" as the country "rots, morally, politically, economically, and physically," with no real plans to address the epidemic of [mass shootings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States "Mass shootings in the United States"), decaying infrastructure, lack of [universal healthcare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_healthcare "Universal healthcare"), ever rising [inequality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States "Income inequality in the United States"), [student debt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_debt#United_States "Student debt"), [child poverty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States#Child_poverty "Poverty in the United States") and the [opioid epidemic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States "Opioid epidemic in the United States").<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> In his 2022 book _The Greatest Evil is War_, Hedges wrote that "Russia has every right to feel threatened, betrayed, and angry. But to understand is not to condone. The invasion of Ukraine, under post-Nuremberg laws, is a criminal war of aggression."<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>

### Accusing Israel of ethnic cleansing and other war crimes [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Accusing Israel of ethnic cleansing and other war crimes")

In late 2023 and early 2024, Hedges gave lectures on the Israel–Hamas war in the [Gaza Strip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip "Gaza Strip"),<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-death-of-israel_76-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-death-of-israel-76">[76]</a></sup> dedicated episodes of his show _The Chris Hedges Report_ to the topic, and appeared as a guest on the _[Mark Steiner Show](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mark_Steiner_Show&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mark Steiner Show (page does not exist)")_.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> He believes that since Zionism's early days its goals was the possession of all of mandatory Palestine and the extermination of the Palestinian people. He states that the end game of Netanyahu's ruling coalition is permanently destroy the idea of a [State of Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine "State of Palestine"), to be accomplished through acts of [genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide") and [ethnic cleansing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing "Ethnic cleansing"). He cites the withholding of food, water, medicine, and the bombing of hospitals, during the war as examples of such acts. He states that Israel with the rise to power of the ultranationalist Jewish-supremacist far-right, what he calls the heirs to [Meir Kahane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Kahane "Meir Kahane"), as evidence of Israel having developed into a fully fascist, hate-filled, [Jewish-supremacist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_supremacy "Jewish supremacy") [apartheid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid "Apartheid") state, that will continue to pursue its transformation into an ethnoreligiously pure state with the explusion of all Palestinians including [Israeli citizens of Palestinian ethnicity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Arabs "Israeli Arabs"). Hedges criticizes U.S. President Biden's, the U.S. government's and the U.S. and European media "total support" for the Israeli narrative including military support and voting down cease-fire proposals in the [United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations"). He supports the [BDS movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDS_movement "BDS movement"), ending aid to and sanctioning Israel. He states that Israel's genocide of Palestinians has "signed its own death sentence" with respect to its "social capital", losing its "facade of civility, its supposed vaunted respect for rule of law and democracy, its mythical story of the courageous Israeli military and miraculous birth of the Jewish nation will lie in ash heaps", Hedges argued.<sup id="cite_ref-death-of-israel_76-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hedges#cite_note-death-of-israel-76">[76]</a></sup>

### NDAA lawsuit [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chris_Hedges&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: NDAA lawsuit")

In 2012, after the [Obama administration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obama_administration "Obama administration") signed the [National Defense Authorization Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2012 "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012") (NDAA), Hedges sued members of the US government, asserting that Section 1021 of the law unconstitutionally allowed presidential authority for indefinite detention without _[habeas corpus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus "Habeas corpus")_. He was later joined in the suit, _[Hedges v. Obama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedges_v._Obama "Hedges v.
