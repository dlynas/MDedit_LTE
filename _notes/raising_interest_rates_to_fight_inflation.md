## Raising Interest Rates to Fight Inflation? Analysis of the MMT View

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mmt_economics/comments/wchq55/raising_interest_rates_to_fight_inflation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mmt_economics/comments/wchq55/raising_interest_rates_to_fight_inflation/)

> Do any of you have a full MMT-based understanding of how the Fed's interest rate affects inflation? 
> 
> I've been trying to figure this out for a long time so forgive the length of this post. The dominant view in mainstream economics is that raising central bank interest rates is one of the best ways to fight inflation. Inflation is caused by demand overshooting supply, and mainstream economists believe high interest rates will reduce consumer demand back in line with supply (by reducing borrowing, jobs, and real income) and therefore reduce inflation. 
> 
> MMT economists generally reject this. Warren Mosler makes the [bold claim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIvhTDp6O9s) that raising interest rates actually increases inflation rather than decreasing it. L Randall Wray [argues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E464oOQ6Tw) that the effect is "indeterminate." Stephanie Kelton has also [warned](https://twitter.com/stephaniekelton/status/1380154529526726666?lang=en) about the potentially inflationary effects of raising interest rates. 
> 
> If MMT economists like Mosler are right, this is probably their most controversial and least accepted economic statement. You can find news stories every day that assume the claim that interest rates fight inflation is an objective fact. 
> 
> The following are some of the reasons I've seen from MMT economists to argue why raising interest rates will not bring down inflation (or at least not by as much as conventionally accepted).  
> 1. When central banks raise interest rates, this means governments spend more on their interest payments. This translates into increased income for bondholders. Higher incomes lead to more consumer demand, pushing up prices. Similarly, banks benefit from higher interest payments from the Federal Reserve. In other words, the interest from the higher interest rates goes to someone in the economy, and their demand increases rather than decreasing.  
> 2. Interest rates are a cost for businesses. When central banks raise interest rates, businesses pass this new cost on to consumers in the form of higher prices, which is inflation by definition.  
> 3. Higher interest rates make it harder to start a business and harder to hold inventory. This reduces supply, leading to higher prices aka inflation.  
> 4. Finally, MMT economists point to the fact that there is no empirical research at all showing that higher interest rates decrease inflation. In fact, the [correlation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=292593&rn=251#) runs in the opposite direction.
> 
> (Mosler also talks about "forward pricing" as a reason why raising interest rates causes inflation, but I don't fully understand what he means by this - maybe one of you can explain.)
> 
> These are all good arguments but I'm still not sure that I buy it completely. Specifically regarding interest payments, this seems like a long-term effect rather than a short-term effect. Most bonds pay interest based on fixed rates, so the higher interest income will only kick in once bonds that are purchased after interest rates are increased reach maturity, which usually takes many years. Also, the people who receive interest income are unlikely to spend it as much compared to people who lost their jobs.
> 
> Regarding the empirical research, mainstream economists would argue that the effect of interest rates on inflation is really hard to study, since higher interest rates are in response to inflation. When inflation rises after the Fed increases rates, they just say inflation was rising already before and the effect of a rate increase takes time.
> 
> The most commonly cited empirical example of higher rates reducing inflation is the Volcker shock of 1980. Mosler [argues](https://twitter.com/wbmosler/status/1377731585118715906) Volcker might have actually prolonged inflation, but it is hard to explain. Still, MMT economists have better examples in my opinion to prove their point on the relationship between interest rates and inflation, such as near-zero rates from 2008 to 2020 in the US and from 1998 to 2022 in Japan coinciding with little to no inflation.
> 
> This topic is honestly exhausting and confusing and I'm not sure what to believe. On the one hand, I do think higher interest rates hurt most consumers and their demand, and on the other hand, I know that that is not the only factor that is important when analyzing the effect of interest rates on inflation. The most likely conclusion for me is that higher interest rates can only effectively reduce inflation if they are raised very high very fast, causing a large recession, which of course is a horrible outcome. MMT-based solutions to inflation (automatic stabilizers in fiscal policy, supply fixes, possibly price controls) are definitely preferable. And what I do know for sure is that mainstream economists are way too confident in their understanding of the relationship between interest rates and inflation. But what do you think about this important topic?

	"Most bonds pay interest based on fixed rates, so the higher interest income will only kick in once bonds that are purchased after interest rates are increased reach maturity, which usually takes many years. "

	That's a static view, not a dynamic view. There are always a set of bonds maturing today that have to be rolled over. The effect comes from the differential of what is maturing today vs what is issued today. 

	The analysis of the interest/price spiral is here: [https://new-wayland.com/blog/interest-price-spiral/](https://new-wayland.com/blog/interest-price-spiral/) 

	If a wage/price spiral exists as a possibility, then an interest/price spiral exists as a possibility. 

	The MMT economist you didn't quote was Bill Mitchell. 

	>Modern monetary theorists consider monetary policy to be a poor tool for counter-stabilisation. It is indirect, blunt and relies on uncertain distributional behaviour. It works with a lag if at all and imposes penalties on regions and cohorts that may not be contributing to the price pressures (for example, when Sydney property prices were booming all of regional Australia which was not was forced to bear the higher interest rates). There is also no strong empirical research to tell us about the impact on debtors and creditors and their spending patterns. It is assumed implicitly that borrowers have higher consumption propensities than lenders but that hasn’t been definitively determined.

	The effectiveness of monetary policy is one area where I disagree with Mosler. 

	Interest increases work mainly by appreciating the real exchange rate to import deflation, and (to a lesser extent) by slowing the velocity of money, despite usually having little impact on money creation in aggregate (increases in government money creation for interest payments are offset by reduced private money creation through bank lending).

		The problem is, the connection between monetary policy and inflation is weak at best, and even given the proposed mechanism is clearly dependent on a given scenario. It might be that monetary policy has some desired impact in some scenario, but given the complete lack of empirical justification and the complexity of the system, there's going to be counter intuitive effects in other scenarios.
		
		I have serious issue with the current dogma that monetary policy has a clear, unambiguous and well understood causal effect on inflation.

	* 🟨 **[aldursys](https://www.reddit.com/user/aldursys)** ⬆️ 1 _(2022-07-31 11:51:35)_

		Except that it may not do either of those things because the linkages are not direct, nor certain. 
		
		There's no guarantee of reduced private money creation, nor any guarantee in reduction in velocity - particularly in an economy where there is an unresolvable supply side shortage. You tend not to get people paying off mortgages when they are short of money to pay the bills. 
		
		Similarly hoping to export more savings in a denomination by attracting the carry trade relies heavily on beliefs about exchange rates that don't hold in practice. Purchasing Price Parity is similarly a myth rejected by MMT, and the wider PK community.

			Well unfortunately the importance of ERPT is a case where I have to disagree with Bill too. I know the literature best here in Australia, and we actually have pretty [good estimates](https://www.rba.gov.a[u/publications](https://www.reddit.com/user/publications)/bulletin/2011/sep/2.html) of exchange rate pass-through coefficients. We know that the pass-through from exchange rate movements to import prices is very strong: 
			> "The point estimates suggest that a 10 per cent appreciation in the exchange rate typically lowers import prices by around 8 per cent. However, the proposition that the effect is 10 per cent – that there is ‘full pass-through’ – is sometimes not rejected in statistical tests."
			
			And that given the weight of import prices in the overall consumption basket: 
			> "a 10 per cent appreciation of the Australian dollar is estimated to lower the level of overall consumer prices by around 1 per cent over a period of around three years."
			
			These estimates are parameters of Australia's main econometric policy model MARTIN (which is an old-style SEM, not some useless DSGE monstrosity). MARTIN gives estimates of the impacts of a given change in the interest rate on output and inflation, and [by excluding each policy transmission channel one-by-one you can judge the mechanisms through which monetary policy works.](https://imgur.com/a/mvshOlY)

				But that's not correlated with the interest rate, which doesn't have the mechanical effect on exchange rates claimed.
				
				And that's because there isn't a one-to-one relationship between money and stuff. It's inductively connected at best.
				
				The reason for that is straightforward. Exchange rate setting has little to do with trade and everything to do with financial market flow.
				
				You can't just buy additional financial exports to make space for greater imports by increasing the interest rate. It doesn't work like that.
				
				I'll admit I have a bit of an advantage here because I've got the chapter from John T Harvey that explains it all.
				
				>Even supporters of purchasing power parity admit that it only holds in the long run – a period of time they say is equivalent to years or even decades. The more likely answer is that it does not hold at all. Because the factors that determine the demand for goods and services differ significantly from those that drive financial capital flows, purchasing power parity cannot possibly explain real-world currency movements. And without purchasing power parity and the full-employment assumption, the Monetary Model no longer serves as the intellectual foundation for the MMT-as-currency-killer argument.

					I don't disagree that financial market flows are the dominant factor in exchange rate determination, at least in most advanced economies (for emerging markets with large trade deficits in the food and energy sectors the story is more complex), but I'm surprised you don't seem to think monetary policy decisions have a major impact on the direction and magnitude of those flows. 
					
					If a country has deeply negative real interest rates (relative to other economies) why would I as a non-resident wish to hold that country's currency as a store of value? Supposing the capital account is open why would I wish to hold the currency even if I were a resident? 
					
					This is not to say any of the interest rate parity models have strong predictive power on their own, - at least not when the central banks concerned are conducting relatively orthodox monetary policy - day-to-day exchange rate movements are overdetermined; influenced by many different factors and speculative randomness. But at the extremes, for example if a country were to adopt a ZIRP, it's a factor which can't be ignored. 
					
					My most profitable trade this year has been being short the Turkish Lira, even though there's a 17% cost of carry annually on the position I'm a long way in front; and so long as Erdogan continues to demand deeply negative real interest rates I see no reason why that should change.

						"If a country has deeply negative real interest rates (relative to other economies) why would I as a non-resident wish to hold that country's currency as a store of value?"
						
						Because they are, for example, holding it on the central bank balance sheet as a 'foreign reserve' which they then discount into your own money. Mostly because they can't admit politically that the only actual reserve is the power to tax in your own denomination. 
						
						People hold money for things other than interest rates - insurance and status purposes primarily, but also neo-mercantile purposes in some variation of the above. Exporters like to keep exchange rates down and drain spending funds from their target markets. That keeps demand flowing in their direction. 
						
						"and so long as Erdogan continues to demand deeply negative real interest rates I see no reason why that should change."
						
						It will change when Erdogan realises he needs to cut public spending or put taxes up to drain the excess Lira properly rather than trying to play the "borrowers spend and savers don't" belief as well as balancing imports so they reflect needs not wants. Once he does that sufficiently then the pressure on the exchange rate will ease by eliminating the effect of the carry. 
						
						Chances are he doesn't have the political power to do anything other than wait for the train to crash into the buffers. 
						
						We can see from both Turkey and Zimbabwe that interest rates have no control function whether they go up or down. It's not steering anything.

							There are a select few currencies with reserve status held in meaningful quantities as FX reserves on foreign central banks' balance sheets.  Most countries don't have the luxury of printing a global reserve asset for which there is always strong external demand - in fact some countries can't even print currency their residents want to hold (see Argentina, Turkey, etc, currently).
							
							I also think you need to think more carefully about the incentives for customers to take bank loans (and correspondingly for banks to create deposits) when the real interest rate on bank loans is deeply negative (in Turkey they're currently approx. -60%). Especially as much of this newly created money will likely be used to acquire foreign assets or finance imports. If you're not going to use interest rates anymore, I do think you need to come up with some other scheme for rationing banks' credit (and deposit) creation. 
							
							I agree that shrinking the fiscal deficit (through tax increases and/or spending cuts) is another way to drain liquidity, reduce effective demand, and in doing so lower inflation and stabilise the exchange rate; my contention is only that monetary policy works too. I'm actually in favour of a ZIRP, but we shouldn't get there by immediately cutting rates, crashing the exchange rate, and allowing inflation to spike (as Turkey has done), only to then try to fix the problem with contractionary fiscal policy (as you suggest Turkey now do). Instead we should apply contractionary fiscal policy while lowering interest rates enough to maintain employment growth and keep inflation on target until rates hit zero. Once rates hit zero, we should maintain employment growth and prevent deflation by running a sufficient fiscal deficit.

								"Most countries don't have the luxury of printing a global reserve asset for which there is always strong external demand"
								
								Correct. That just means that today's exports pay for today's imports and the job is done. 
								
								Actually not having anybody outside your currency area holding your currency is a huge benefit. Having nobody hold the currency inside your currency area is even better. At that point you have a permanent balanced budget. 
								
								"Especially as much of this newly created money will likely be used to acquire foreign assets or finance imports."
								
								It can't be used to finance any of those things. In a floating exchange rate system those importing into a country simply finance the exports of a country. That's what a floating exchange rate means. (Savings being an export product). 
								
								A Full liquidity rule is limited by collateral and capacity to pay. Once you have banks that can be allowed to go bust market pressure will kill those banks who do not consider the denomination of the capacity to pay. The quality of the loan and what it can be used for is a central bank regulated activity, so they can set the rules for local currency loans and for collateral enforcement. 
								
								Turkey can only fix the situation it is in by contracting fiscal space. And there's little point doing that if you're just giving people money simply for holding the denomination - since that is increased fiscal action. 
								
								Cutting interest rates \*is\* contractionary since it removes money from people's hands. Those holding lira simply to obtain that offset will try to get out of Lira, but eventually the outputs and the inputs match - killing the effects of the carry. The exchange rate may continue to drop, but further shifting of the cost of imported needs onto imported wants will kill the imported wants strengthening the currency. 
								
								The experience of what has happened with the Rouble shows that the MMT view of exchange rates is correct. Killing imports pushed the currency exchange rate back up - exactly as we predicted.

									> Having nobody hold the currency inside your currency area is even better. At that point you have a permanent balanced budget. 
									
									This is a disaster if you care at all about monetary sovereignty, the foundation of which is residents of a currency area accepting, issuing and trading liabilities denominated in the national currency. Such that the national currency is serving all the functions of money, acting as a unit of account, medium of exchange and a store of value. If residents reject the national currency, you either need to revert to barter or some form of informal 'dollarisation' occurs (see Venezuela, and to a lesser extent Argentina). 
									
									> It can't be used to finance any of those things.
									
									I take a loan from a Turkish bank in Lira (at a real interest rate of -60%), the Turkish bank creates a Lira deposit for me, I sell that deposit in the foreign exchange market, to buy a USD deposit which I  either hold as an investment or use to pay for imported goods. In a free floating exchange rate system this exerts downwards pressure on the exchange rate. 
									> Cutting interest rates *is* contractionary since it removes money from people's hands. 
									
									This is true only if money velocity is held constant, and only if reduced government money creation for interest payments is not offset by increased private money creation by banks (as bank credit becomes more attractive at lower interest rates). 
									> The experience of what has happened with the Rouble shows that the MMT view of exchange rates is correct. Killing imports pushed the currency exchange rate back up - exactly as we predicted.

										"This is a disaster if you care at all about monetary sovereignty"
										
										No. It's just a government provisioning itself with its own money. Which is what a denomination is there to do. It's a simple public monopoly. 
										
										What the private sector does in response to that is a matter for it to decide. If it ends up deciding to use bottle tops as money that isn't a concern. The provisioning system can continue. 
										
										Once you understand that, then nobody else using the money for anything else other than paying taxes means you end up with a balanced budget. 
										
										The fun starts when people start saving in the denomination. MMT is, at root, the explaination of how to manage that saving so that government provisioning can continue uninterrupted.

	If you jack up interest rates, people stop borrowing for cars, real estate, business expansion, more defaults, floating rate debt gets painful, etc... The cost of capital goes up so there is less business activity in general. It's hard for me to believe that this doesn't reduce demand, so in a demand-driven inflationary environment, that should reduce inflation. That doesn't mean it's the best way to accomplish it, but I'm sure 50% interest rates would kill demand and thus reduce inflation (assuming it's not caused by some fundamental shortage).

		I understand why you would intuitively think that would happen, but can you show me the evidence that it does? Maybe real estate lending slows down, where's the evidence that commercial lending slows down? The actual data from [2022](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=SXby) shows no slowdown in commercial lending in response to rate hikes and actually shows lending speeding up. Similarly, for the Volcker years, there was a slight, temporary deceleration (that could be attributed to a number of causes), but the volume of outstanding commercial loans didn't shrink for a single quarter until Q2 [1983](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=SXc5).

	It is one of the best real study case for looking at what happens to inflation when real rates (interest rate - inflation) rise and drop. 

	Their central bank is one of the most orthodox and fast acting at using rates to control inflation.

	I think the question is not if raising rates reduces inflation, the question is if the recession that raising rates causes to reduce inflation is the best way to reduce inflation.

		This is what I can find on Brazil: https://bric-group.com/res/images/pub_imgs/425_aaa-e1561546444996.png It's not obvious to me looking at this graph that higher interest rates are followed by less inflation. For example, looking at the 90s, you can see that inflation is falling before interest rates are jacked up, and then after interest rates are jacked up, inflation actually begins to rise. All the empirical studies I've seen (and there aren't many) have not found that higher interest rates reduce inflation.
