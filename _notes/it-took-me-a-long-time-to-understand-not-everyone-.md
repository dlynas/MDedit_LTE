## It took me a long time to understand not everyone is actually capable of critical thought. Itâ€™s not that they refuse to critically consider issues, they simply canâ€™t. Their brain is not built that way. 

But now that I do understand this itâ€™s improved my quality of life. I recognize pretty quickly now whether or not youâ€™re even capable of critically engaging a subject as opposed to screaming your preset knee jerk position. 

I have better things to do.

"I found a very liberating position for myself as an artist.
And that was, I sort of gave up on the human race,
and gave up on the American dream and culture and nation,
and decided that I didn't care about the outcome.
And that gave me a lot of freedom
from a kind of distant platform to be sort of amused,
a kind of, to watch the whole thing
with a combination of wonder and pity,
and try to put that into words.
Not caring about the outcome, what do you mean by that?
Not having an emotional stake
and whether this experiment with human beings works.
I really don't care.
I love people as I meet them one by one.
People are just wonderful as individuals.
You see the whole universe in their eyes,
if you look carefully.
But as soon as they begin to group,
as soon as they begin to clot,
when there are five of them or 10,
or even groups as small as two,
they begin to change.
They sacrifice the beauty of the individual
for the sake of the group.
I decided it was all under the control of groups now,
whether it's business, religion, political people, or what.
And I would distance myself from wishing for a good outcome.
Let it do what it's going to do.
And I'll enjoy it as an entertainer."
