## we don't talk enough about the West Bank, which is supposed to be Palestinian territory, but is dotted with hundreds and hundreds of strategically placed illegal Israeli settlements, with thousands of miles of roads built between them, cutting through Palestinian towns. Palestinians are not allowed to drive on these roads, roads that are built in their own occupied territory. The West Bank looks like a piece of Swiss cheese with all of the holes being Israeli settlements. In the months just before October 7th Israeli settlers murdered 36 children in the West Bank. many of the settlements are occupied by the most extreme fundamentalist Zionists. These settlements are illegal under international law but nobody is doing anything about it and each new settlement makes it more and more impossible for a 2-state state solution, because the state of Palestine would be littered with hundreds of Israeli towns. This was all consciously done by Israel to sabotage the Oslo Agreement. it worked.
