		And that's just the tip of the iceberg. The system was broken long before that and no attempt to change it will work unless something is done about ~~lobbyist cash~~ legal bribes. [This](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/ban-lobbyists-fundraising-politicians/) article was written in 2018 and not one congressmember has championed anything remotely like it yet from either side of the isle. I wonder why?
		
		[It has become a serious threat to our nation as this 2016 article pointed out and the media almost never speaks of it...]( https://priceonomics.com/when-lobbying-was-illegal/)
		
		>Nearly half of all members of Congress now take lobbying jobs when they leave office. Congressmen have written that serving on a congressional committee is now ‚Äúmainly valuable as part of the interview process for a far more lucrative job as a K Street lobbyist‚Äù and that it has ‚Äúbecome routine to see members of Congress drop their seat in Congress like a hot rock when a particularly lush vacancy opens up.‚Äù

		  That's the sad and disturbing reality in congress.  Written back in 2016 and it's only gotten worse. Nobody wants to kill their golden goose.

			Addressing lobbying is really tricky because you do not want to create laws whose side effect is to limit the voters ability to influence their representatives through non-monetary means. 
			
			In addition to this the overwhelming majority seem to think lobbying is about cash donations when that is not the case. The most powerful lobby bar none is AARP and they do not give much compared to many. A lobby's power is their ability to turn out voters.

				>Ban lobbyists from fundraising for candidates
				
				>Lobbyists should not be able to fundraise for candidates‚Äîor political parties‚Äîand thereby gain more access and influence than if they were not able to circumvent the limits on their own contributions. A lobbyist fundraising ban should be crafted as follows:
				
				>Define lobbyist fundraising broadly. Some lobbying regulations specifically pertain to ‚Äúbundling,‚Äù a term that usually signifies collecting and transmitting contributions or taking credit for them in a written record. Fundraising should be defined more broadly to include: hosting or underwriting events where funds are raised; transmitting or delivering contributions from another person; making or sending a communication soliciting contributions; or otherwise directly or indirectly soliciting, transmitting, or facilitating a contribution to any candidate or political party. Moreover, lobbyists should not be able to fundraise for nonprofits or other organizations tied to lawmakers.
				Make any lobbyist fundraising count towards the lobbyist‚Äôs individual contribution limit. Contribution limits are (or ought to be) set at an amount that allows reasonable expressions of support yet remains low enough to mitigate the risk of undue influence. Therefore, in those states where lobbyists are allowed to make personal contributions, lobbyists should be able to meet this threshold either by raising money from others or by contributing themselves, as long as the total does not exceed their personal limit.
				
				>Include reasonable exceptions. Any ban on lobbyist fundraising should be clearly limited so as not to infringe on the mere expression of support or opposition to a candidate or other sharing of information that does not include a solicitation. Moreover, it should not prevent lobbyists from engaging in volunteer activity unrelated to fundraising or from raising funds for their own campaign should they decide to run for office. Lastly, courts have expressed concern about bans on fundraising that could prevent an individual from advising family members about political contributions. Therefore, solicitation of immediate family members should be exempt.
				
				>Prohibit candidates and political parties from knowingly accepting lobbyist fundraising proceeds. To help ensure adequate enforcement, both the lobbyist and the recipient of the contribution should be liable for violations of the fundraising ban in situations where the recipient should know that the money was the result of lobbyist fundraising.
				Ensure that the law adequately defines who is a lobbyist. A ban on lobbyist fundraising will only be effective if lobbyists are appropriately identified. Particularly at the federal level, many would-be lobbyists are able to avoid registration by taking advantage of a lax definition‚Äîa long-standing problem that should be corrected. Moreover, in order to prevent easy evasion, the ban on fundraising should extend to any agent of the lobbyist as well as any employee of the same lobbying firm.

					If you're thinking of Citizens United with this comment, that only applies to political advertising and communication spending. Donations to a Super PAC are limitless and disclosure of the source of funds is not required. But Super PACs are not controlled by politicians and are not allowed to give money to politicians or their campaigns. Super PACs are designed to raise money to *influence* elections (largely through advertising) but it is not legal for them to affiliate with a politician's campaign in any way. They just create ads which say "Vote for X" or "Don't vote for Y." They are a problem in our system for sure, but it's unrelated to bribery.

And I think it describes literally everyone who runs for Senate or President. Yeah, even Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are megalomaniacs. If they weren't, they'd find better ways to spend their days.

You see the same thing in law enforcement- the issue is systemic and the whole body needs a god damned enema.

	In our local State legislators, we had a bunch of young and minority people get elected. Most dropped out the next session because there was no way they could afford to live and work on the low level pay. They only made about $38,000 a year. Only the independently rich and/or corrupt are able to afford be representatives.

	* üü® **[deleted]** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 55 _(2023-08-21 20:36:16)_

		Yep. Even in Congress, $174,000 sounds nice until you realize that almost everyone has to pay for a DC residence and a home residence, which might also be in a major, expensive city.  Salary is even lower for staff throughout all areas of government. Then people also want term limits and even post-employment restrictions.  
		 
		Anyone entering government has to be prepared for making very little money, having a finite amount of time in the job, having their employment options restricted even when they aren't being paid and other barriers to just having a career and making a living. 
		
		 If you make it hard to have a career and make a living in politics because you want people to just do it for the love of serving, you're largely going to attract people who can afford the luxury of serving because they don't need a career.

				>Ehhhh, let‚Äôs pump the breaks on pay raises for the fucking Feds‚Ä¶they don‚Äôt do shit (a meaningless house rep does less than shit) 
				
				That's wrong.  Congress is a full time legislature.  When adjusted for inflation, members of Congress actually make about 10% less than they did in the 1930s, when Congress was more of a part-time legislature due to travel realities and would spend months at a time, or even a whole year, at home.
				
				>and they can basically expense everything out of their campaigns‚Ä¶it pays for all their meals and huge chunks of travel for like the entire election year‚Ä¶
				
				Also wrong. They can only expense campaign related costs, none of which include the home residence or the second residence in DC.  Congress is actually behind the states on this one, as state legislators can often expense lodging in the capital city if they live a certain distance from the capital.
				
				>But guess what ALL the states suffer bc they don‚Äôt have a fucking money printer
				
				The average full time state legislator makes $40,000 per year.  It would not be a significant amount of money for a state to pay a living wage.

						I mean if you took that argument to the general public, you're right. It probably would be a slam dunk of everyone agreeing and nothing changing. 
						
						However I think that's kind of the point of what people are trying to point out.
						
						Only the rich and corrupt can realistically take these positions. In doing do they only approve decisions that advance their best interests, thus reinforcing the point of view of the people that these reps don't do anything, resulting in people not wanting to make changes that would make it possible for non rich, non corrupt people to realistically be able to serve in these positions. Turning it into a self perpetuating cycle.
						
						Would increasing pay and benefits immediately solve this? Probably not. Often people don't want to deal with this level of responsibility, but it at least opens the door for better people to run.
						
						I tend to liken it to tech companies. Everyone gets so awe struck when they see all the crazy benefits these places show to try and attract top talent. The best and brightest. Everyone loves to say "we should run govt like a business." And yet people are also the first on the phone to yell at their civil servants "well my taxes pay your salary!" (Often yelling at someone likely making min wage) And are happy to take tax breaks at the cost of funding their govt employees. 
						
						Quite simply we can't have it both ways. And sure just throwing money at things doesn't solve everything and yes some reps will 100% waste that money on bullshit. Quite simply its on us as voters to know when they do and vote them out accordingly.

						You have a fundamental misunderstanding of the EC. The electoral college doesn‚Äôt balance out cities vs rural areas. It wasn‚Äôt even meant to balance small states vs big ones, it just started doing that in 1929 when the house reps number was frozen at 435. If it was uncapped again, the EC is less of an issue, because big and small states like California, Texas, and Montana get the appropriate amount of representation.
						
						The electoral college was created to allocate state votes in a time where information traveled much more slowly than it can today. The EC is functionally useless.

	Dr. Grant, a contributing Opinion writer, is an organizational psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Wharton School, the author of ‚ÄúThink Again‚Äù and the host of the TED podcast ‚ÄúRe:Thinking.‚Äù

	>On the eve of the first debate of the 2024 presidential race, trust in government is rivaling historic lows. Officials have been working hard to safeguard elections and assure citizens of their integrity. But if we want public office to have integrity, we might be better off eliminating elections altogether.

	>If you think that sounds anti-democratic, think again. The ancient Greeks invented democracy, and in Athens many government officials were selected through sortition ‚Äî a random lottery from a pool of candidates. In the United States, we already use a version of a lottery to select jurors. What if we did the same with mayors, governors, legislators, justices and even presidents?

	>People expect leaders chosen at random to be less effective than those picked systematically. But in multiple experiments led by the psychologist Alexander Haslam, the opposite held true. Groups actually made smarter decisions when leaders were chosen at random than when they were elected by a group or chosen based on leadership skill.

	>Why were randomly chosen leaders more effective? They led more democratically. ‚ÄúSystematically selected leaders can undermine group goals,‚Äù Dr. Haslam and his colleagues suggest, because they have a tendency to ‚Äúassert their personal superiority.‚Äù When you‚Äôre anointed by the group, it can quickly go to your head: I‚Äôm the chosen one.

		When you dont know what position in society you are going to get, the incentive is to improve everyone's life because you could end up anywhere. This is an old idea in political philosophy.
		
		These results make sense. Randomly chosen legislators know they are unlikely to be chosen again so they have little incentive to act with a "class-like" interest as they do now and more incentive to generally improve society for when they go back to their old life.
		
		If you pull a dude randomly from a small town and he knows he's going back there next session he might be interested in making that small town better, even if only in his own self interest.

				The president just executes the laws passed by Congress. Sortition would be used to form the group of people that makes up Congress.

				Take a look at the link [https://electionscience.org](https://electionscience.org/approval-voting-faqs/) , they do a good job of illustrating how even RCV creates "spoiler" candidates (unwanted candidates) winning when there are three or more candidates on the ballot, and Approval Voting is (1) easier and (2) solves for all of these flaws.

					Approval voting also has strategic voting. Under approval voting, you should always approve of your 1st place candidate, and always disapprove of your last place candidate, but marking whether you approve or disapprove of all other candidates depends on your expectations of the behavior of other voters.

I would promise to earn and live off of no more than my salary the entirety of my time served and my ads would dare my colleagues to do the same. I would run on a platform that would include overturning Citizens United in favor of government funded elections so that once again the idea that any child can grow up to be president is true and so that our elected leaders aren't campaigning more than they are legislating. My number two issue after C.U. is reversing wealth inequality (which would make everything better) so we are not a plutocracy; fixing housing shortages, universal healthcare with private options, ending homelessness, gun control, and the climate. There is no reason the "richest country in the world" should have starving children. Systemic racism will be acknowledged, taught, fixed. What can be done about reparations? Why are we not doing more for our Native Americans?

I'd push for Supreme Court term limits. I'd push for freezing of assets over a certain amount while in office, as well as limit ability for Reps and Senators to cosplay as podcasters and pundits when they are sending form letters to constituents. I would push to reform education, including reforming teachers pay. I'd form a committee of experts and artists to create PSAs about civics and diversity and other topics that have been decimated by misinformation.

	Yes, ranked choice and other systems of voting would be better. Yes we should keep pushing for that. But we need to at least be real about the fact that there are many options in every primary election who get passed over just because they are seen as outsider-y, particularly democratic progressives.

	Now only do you get power, you get access to first-hand knowledge, like business and economic data you can bank off of. You‚Äôre not supposed to do insider trader, but all the politicians can do it. They keep it on the down low to minimize the public outrage. But they get money from playing the markets, donations, oil companies, big business buddies buying you expensive vacations and getting your kids into top schools and universities (cough, Clarence Thomas, cough). Corruption in government doesn‚Äôt run in only places like Venezuela and Israel. Oh no, it happens here, too. Big time. A lot of these talking heads know that what they spew is BS, like ‚Äúclimate change is a hoax‚Äù, or ‚ÄúTrump actually won the election‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs patently false‚Ä¶their electorate believes it. They just repeat it to get reelected, stay in power and keep that sweet sweet cash flow.

	I don‚Äôt see how to better attract good people who tell the truth to run. It just so happens that Democrat values align with the sane people and Republicans align with the insane and idiotic.

	Doesn't help that so many state legislatures dropped the salaries of their elected officials to an unlivable wage so that only a bunch of old retired doctors, lawyers, and wealthy business others can afford to run or hold office. All under the guise that it was meant to stop corruption which makes absolutely no fucking sense because corruption is when you make money from outside your paid wages.

	  

	The Democratic party needs to declare an end to campaigning as we know it. It should create an official App that includes entries for all potential candidates and allows people to do a deep dive on who they are. They can post their ads there, do clips answering voters questions, and a bunch of interactive stuff. I don't want to just vote for extroverts. I want to vote for all those amazing introverts out there who would make fantastic legislators but just don't feel comfortable enough tackling the shit show that is modern campaigning.

	I'm not sure that most people read the article, but the suggestion being floated is for legislators to be chosen from the general public **by lottery**, because right now it is too hard to keep bad people (like narcissists) from running for office.

	I may be elitist, but I can't see this as being a very good idea. I have a firm belief that educating, training, and specializing in something makes a person better suited to do that thing. I don't think that picking someone off the street and asking "hey, can you decide on whether we should set automobile CAFE standards 5% higher over the course of the next decade?" is a good idea. I don't think that most people - remember, 60% of the US didn't go to college, the majority because *they simply didn't want to be educated more* - are willing to put in the time and effort to fully understand the issues.

	I also think that there is value in experience. Sure, everyone rails on about how "incumbents keep getting re-elected", but it takes **years** to get up to speed on all these issues. Plus, most of the people complaining about the incumbents are of the opposite political party, so what they are really angry about is that they don't feel represented. That is definitely something we need to address - perhaps proportional representation - but I don't think we should make incumbency toxic. 

	Back to the original point - choosing representatives by lottery is sure to eliminate experience in our representatives. If they change out every two years, then very likely no one will know what is going on. And how long can you realistically "draft" someone for this job? Four years, at best? 

	The entire scheme is kind-of dumb.

	Part of the solution is taking money out of politics. The million and billionaires who do not want folks willing to compromise, they want politicians who will do just as they ask and that is partly why we have such a limited pool of candidates to choose from. There are small political parties that can't make it to the stage because the people with money don't want reasonable people. They can't manipulate them.

	Get money out of politics and limit stumping to a month before elections so governors have to take care of their damn state instead of spending 18 months doing nothing for their people.
