## In my latest @cocktailsandcapitalism conversation, I spoke with Jewish organizer and activist Max Geller @maximumwage about the birth of new Palestine Action chapters around the world in response to the intensified g***cide that has been raging for months.

‚ÄúTHE GLOBALIZATION OF PALESTINE ACTION WITH MAX GELLER‚Äù üîó Links in bio!

As discussed in last year‚Äôs episode featuring Jodie Jones @missjodiejones , Palestine Action @pal_action is a UK-based network of activists that has PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN 2 arms factories and caused millions in damages to Israel‚Äôs arms dealers. 

The main target of this network is Elbit Systems, which Max describes as the ‚Äúmost evil company in the entire world.‚Äù 

Calls to Action:
*Take a Palestine Action direct action training
*Help provide arrestee, court, and prison support (info on their website)
*Donate to their Legal Defense Fund
*Follow Palestine action on social media @pal_action @pal_actionus @palestineactionfrance @pal_action_scot @manchester_palestine_action

"We permanently force the closure of two Elbit sites
in our first 18 months of existence.
So we've shifted to targeting every bit of infrastructure
from their web designer all the way up to their trucks.
Anyone can figure out the logistics
by which these weapons are transported
from their local community to battlefields
and figure out how they can stop it
and dare the powers that be to prevent them from doing so.
Yeah, here's a quote from you from the Real News Network
where you say it doesn't take hundreds of people
to shut down a factory.
It takes a few people with a good plan.
I love that.
And that is why I love direct action as well.
We just saw an incredible debut action
from the comrades in Palestine Action France,
Talos, which is a major, major supplier
to the Israeli Air Force, a major, major supplier
to their drone fleet.
Every single truck access point was sabotaged
with nails in the road.
They just drove hundreds and hundreds of nails
in the middle of the night, making it impossible
for any truck to enter this building.
So that day instead of building weapons,
the workers had to remove thousands of nails
from the parking lots.
And once these direct actions stop being one-offs,
once we start showing up day after day,
that's a movement and that really scares people.
You can tell by the way the state is trying to repress us,
we're scaring the right people."
