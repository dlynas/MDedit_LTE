## Trans / Other Critiques of Butler's Performativity

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/19e4w03/trans_other_critiques_of_butlers_performativity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/19e4w03/trans_other_critiques_of_butlers_performativity/)

> I've noticed that trans people feel two ways about Butler-- either they find the concept of performativity compelling and liberatory, or they find it trivializing and untrue.

For example, feeling from a young age that you must be the other sex/gender, feeling that certain gestures are more natural for you than others.
> 
> Does performativity actually preclude an understanding of deep gender feeling? From my understanding, performativity does not really theorize deep gender feelings and where they come from, which is perhaps a flaw, but I don't necessarily think that performativity excludes those sensations from being possible. I agree with Serano's critique that gender is perhaps more than a performance, but I'm not sure I'm convinced that performativity is an actually shallow concept of gender devoid of serious feeling or deeper underpinnings of gender.

	Performativity =/= performance for one and I think much of the equivocation that critics accuse performativity/Butler of is misunderstanding that performativity refers to conditions of possibility and accretion and that this doesn‚Äôt preclude or negate how a given subject feels about their gender. It‚Äôs also worth noting that ‚Äúgender feelings‚Äù as you gloss them are historically circumscribed experiences‚Äîlike any subjective experience‚Äîand that the fact of ‚Äúhaving‚Äù an experience doesn‚Äôt necessarily explain *how* such an experience could occur or traverse a subject. It‚Äôs also worth noting, and this is true of any subject whether cis or trans, that performativity doesn‚Äôt conceal an authenticity of gender feeling but that it‚Äôs masks all the way down; we are constituted in the performative nature of gender or whatever other predicate one would ascribe to a subject. 

	It‚Äôs been quite some time since I read Gender Trouble or Bodies That Matter, but when I read the latter in grad school it was very much presented as Butler‚Äôs response to criticisms that their argument excluded transness. I don‚Äôt pay much attention to Butler, but I would be curious to know if they‚Äôve articulated or given an account of their recent identification as non-binary and I have to assume that any such articulation would pose a decent rejoinder to those accusing them of being a crypto terf or whatever.

		Yes so if I‚Äôm understanding you, Butler is saying there is no essence and it‚Äôs all really layers of performance (masks all the way down), but it‚Äôs not precluding that those feelings aren‚Äôt truly felt or meaningful to people.
		
		Can you explain a little more what you mean when you say performative refers to ‚Äúconditions of possibility and accretion‚Äù are you talking about the iterative nature of gender performance? 
		
		It‚Äôs good to know Bodies That Matter deliberately deals with transness. That makes me more inclined to give it a read, though really I have no reason to read Butlers work in general beyond wanting to learn more about this controversy.

			Correct and this leads to your next question. 
			
			> Can you explain a little more what you mean when you say performative refers to ‚Äúconditions of possibility and accretion‚Äù are you talking about the iterative nature of gender performance?
			
			Right, that performativity refers to the iterability of gender and that in fact it‚Äôs constituted in this non-identical repetition rather than a repeated essence. Gender is an impersonal process not a personal quality; or rather, gender as personal quality is what‚Äôs typically thought of as essential even if it‚Äôs only occasional. We are traversed by gender. This is maybe me injecting more of a Deleuze thing into it but that‚Äôs my take.

	As someone who is just getting interested in philosophical theory and is currently reading Bodies That Matter I find the book incredibly challenging and rewarding to work through. I find that book/jezebel excerpt you linked much less so. 

	I mean just in the first chapter Butler has a fascinating inquiry into Plato‚Äôs Timaeus that made me want to run out and read Plato I was so struck by it. 

	I think even if one were to disagree with Butler‚Äôs claims (which I may by the time I finish it), their power as a deep thinker of ontological problematics is undeniable.

	* üü® **[deleted] (OP)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 4 _(2024-01-24 11:31:39)_

		I also love Butler's writing. I reread gender trouble recently and I was just struck by how interesting it is. It's a fun and challenging/provocative read. I know it may not be the most "correct" theory (I am not well versed enough in critical theory to judge) but I think it's a shame that so many people dismiss it without barely having engaged with it at all.

	Performativity is incompatable with sexual essentialism.  There is nothing in performativity that can explain 'deep feelings' that emanate from a biological and not a psychological component because it expresses a perpetual state of becoming not being.

	I think "gender identity" is a basically religious notion that shouldn't replace sex in any area of life. But let's talk about things Serano said.

	>If one more person tells me that "all gender is performance," I think I am going to strangle them.

	Julia Serano normalizing hate and violence against trans people. Genocide starts tomorrow! It's a rule of the internet that any given expression of transphobia is permissible when expressed by a trans person. 

	>In fact, if there's one thing that all of us should be able to agree on, it's that gender is a confusing and complicated mess.

	Self-admitted confusing and complicated messes generally aren't good legal concepts.

	>But performance doesn't explain why certain behaviors and ways of being come to me more naturally than others. It offers no insight into the countless restless nights I spent as a pre-teen wrestling with the inexplicable feeling that I should be female.

	Neither does Serano's essentialism. In fact, the psychoanalysis of trans motivations is generally forbidden by trans activists. Serano has a whole axe to grind denying AGP is a thing. It's inexplicable *in principle* because it's a mystical, religious concept.

	>Because I'm transsexual, I am sometimes accused of impersonation or deception when I am simply being myself. So it seems to me that this strategy of fictionalizing gender will only ever serve to marginalize me further.

	Such a time capsule. This was before the memo came out that trans women are women and language creates biology.

	>And gender doesn't feel like a **performance** when, for the first time in your life, you feel safe and empowered enough to **express yourself** in ways that resonate with you, rather than remaining closeted for the benefit of others.

	And of course you express yourself by performing certain behaviors...Serano is conceding Butler's basic point here. We were supposed to reject the performance talk for *strategic* reasons, namely that in 2010 it still seemed unthinkably audacious to go with the TWAW talking points that ended up winning out.

	>Let's stop trying to deconstruct gender into nonexistence, and instead start celebrating it as inexplicable, varied, profound, and intricate.

	Again, *inexplicable* is important. Is there another area of critical theory where NOT accounting for something is an important first principle? Above all, we must not ask why Julia Serano transitioned. LOL!

		Why do you think Serano is transphobic? I don't really care one way or the other but that was not the impression I got from reading the piece.

					The same ovarit where posts like this are taken seriously:
					
					> I think I'm starting to get a glimpse of the utopia these transsexuals and transhumanist envision.
					Women will be harvested for all of their reproductive and useful parts. Women will then be genocided with the possible exception of a small number kept as prostitutes for the very elite.
					Children who have been transed with puberty blockers and surgeries that stunted their development will serve as sex slaves for pedophiles and the pedophilic adjacent, already a far more common desire than I think any of us want to admit based on the ubiquity of CSA. Some of these forever children as well as some AGP men will get uterus transplants to produce the next generation. Female born from artificial reproduction can be harvested for the huge number of ova needed and then killed.
					Meanwhile, research will continue into artificial wombs, partially artificial people that are adapted/designed to live on a polluted planet, male cloning and consciousness transfer either into the new "bodies" or onto servers. Men will have triumphed over women and life itself. The only thing they have to do is kill and maim everything.
					I wish I could say that this is entirely a flight of fantasy, but the desire and the propaganda making all of this acceptable already exist. Not to mention the start of the experimentation to try and force this into reality.

			AGP is ‚Äúautogynephile‚Äù and refers to a fringe theory that trans women have a sexual fetish of being seen as a woman which motivates their transition; as far as I know, the claim isn‚Äôt that ‚Äúthere are trans women for whom this is true,‚Äù but that ‚Äúthis is what all trans women are.‚Äù While I find her politics otherwise pretty dumb, the YouTuber contrapoints has made some videos dealing specifically with this canard. 
			
			FWIW the user you‚Äôre responding to as dogmatically anti trans so proceed with caution.

				Yeah the thing is that when trans people have disagreements about how transsexuality is understood or articulated, it isn‚Äôt also necessarily being packaged alongside policy prescriptions that harm trans people. That is why if I as a trans person say ‚ÄúI think gender identity is a religious notion,‚Äù I‚Äôm not attacked for being transphobic (oh wait sometimes I am!) This should be fairly obvious to someone as intelligent as you!
				
				Now for AGP: it certainly exists insofar as it is a term that describes a real phenomena. Serano herself wrote a paper about it, where she so delicately calls it ‚Äúfemale embodiment fantasy,‚Äù (cringe asf). What‚Äôs interesting to me is the tendency of your particular crowd of anti-trans goofballs to assert that AGP is some seriously sinister condition rather than just run of the mill autosexuality (just in trans people). It‚Äôs never really explained what the throughline from ‚Äúthis person is an AGP,‚Äù to ‚Äúthis person is a dangerous predator,‚Äù is. These are the kinds of things that get discussed in the terf ‚Äúhome base‚Äù of Ovarit (which reads like stormfront, btw).
				
				Of course we trans people lampoon the foolishness of agp. Hell yeah sissy porn made us trans! There was a video with translucent swirling spiral overlaid on a transsexual getting her cheeks clapped while Katy Perry‚Äôs California Girls is blasted at full volume and the flashing text ‚ÄúCASTRATE YOURSELF NOW, BE A GOOD SISSY!‚Äù and by god I‚Äôve been mind controlled ever since I saw it. I can‚Äôt believe everyone figured us out!
				
				Still, instead of taking the time to reflect and ask questions about the range of human sexuality and sexual experiences, and also the way that sexuality and trans* experiences are often deeply intertwined (trans is at least in some part about sex, and there is no moral value assigned here), we just launch into an insane conspiracy about big gender, sissy hypno cabals, and more.
				
				The big brain trains all accept and embrace AGP. Serano has an essay in whipping girl about it. Chu wrote a whole book about it. Preciado is AAP or whatever shaving your pubes and gluing them to your face while you fuck your ass with silicone and massage t-gel into your skin is. I mean come on, daddy Blanchard said that it can actually be good for us to transition if we are AGP. 
				
				The reality is that AGP means nothing more than the love of oneself as a woman

							>Also you, elsewhere: I‚Äôm an afropessimist.
							
							Yes, I really do try to make sure my arguments are consistent! Afropessimism and radfem have in common a critique of liberal notions of *agency* that typically go with sex positivity, pro-trans, etc. Afropessimism is also clear that anti-blackness comes from a deeply sadomasochistic place, putting it line with Audre Lorde and other critics of BDSM. Jared Sexton, Afropessimist, also critiques the mixed-race movement of the 1990s for essentially the same rhetoric as the trans movement: nonbinary, etc. Dworkin also wrote a lot about the role of race in porn and society.
							
							All told, TERF + Afropessimist is a coherent worldview.
							
							>It‚Äôs worth noting that afropessimists‚Äô understanding of race is literally just white supremacy. That is, they identify with the subordination of blackness.
							
							I hate how this "identify" rhetoric from the trans movement infects discussions of race. Blackness is not a matter of "identification" at all. It's a legal status. It was possible to argue what race you were in court and lose:
							
							[https://gould.usc.ed[u/assets](https://www.reddit.com/user/assets)/docs/Litigating\_Whiteness.pdf](https://gould.usc.ed[u/assets](https://www.reddit.com/user/assets)/docs/Litigating_Whiteness.pdf)
							
							White people made up blackness to represent a subordinate, subhuman position in society. That's true no matter how I "identify." Like...who cares about what black people think about ourselves? Identity simply does not work the way the trans movement claims.
							
							>AP ratifies and validates the entire trajectory and conceptual apparatus of white supremacist construction and understanding of blackness and says ‚Äúthis is the ontological character of blackness.‚Äù
							
							Fanon: The black soul is a construction by white folks. This is literally you telling me I need to express pride in myself as a Negro, to *make* a positive identity out of something created by white people. Also Fanon:
							
							>The educated black man, slave of the myth of the spontaneous and cosmic Negro, feels at some point in time that his race no longer understands him. Or that he no longer understands his race. He is only too pleased about this, and by developing further this difference, this incomprehension and discord, he discovers the meaning of his true humanity. Less commonly he want to feel a part of his people. And with feverish lips and frenzied heart he plunges into the great black hole. We shall see that this wonderfully generous attitude rejects the present and future in the name of a mystical past.  
							>  
							>When you point out a mote of hypocrisy in others‚Äô eye you may do well to check out the plank in your own
							
							So what exactly did I say that was hypocritical? I can't believe you think the observation that white people made up blackness to be a bad thing is the same as a guy in a dress with a humiliation fetish. As if there were no alternative, egalitarian view of women available. Blackness is not like femaleness in that only the former was specifically invented to mean less-than.
							
							FYI black people in general are less on board with trans, "black trans lives matter" notwithstanding:

								> I hate how this "identify" rhetoric from the trans movement infects discussions of race.
								
								Your insistence on ascribing identification with transness is, again, just you telling on yourself and *your* own obsession with transness. Identification as such has nothing necessarily to do with trans people.
								 
								> Blackness is not a matter of "identification" at all. It's a legal status.
								
								It's arguably both, as is gender for that matter. Gender identity and expression are protected categories in some parts of the US so if we're just going off of appeals to American law, your point is moot!
								
								Your use of Fanon doesn't make much sense to me other than that it attests to the fact that race is historical, which is to say contingent. Any predicate that would be ascribed to a human being, even the category of human being, is historically contingent‚Äîhence why there is ample anthropological evidence of gender expression being variable geographically and for their being gender expressions and identifications aside from "cis" in different groups around the world. 
								
								If you are an afropessimist then the logical conclusion for you is to assert that we must destroy the world. That's what the afropessimists say. Instead, you come here and inveigh about afropessimism and shit on trans people. 
								
								> the same as a guy in a dress with a humiliation fetish
								
								This literally is just bigotry and requires no response as a serious proposition. I haven't ever seen anyone resort to slurs against you so it's odd to me that you feel entitled to be so rude to others.

									>Identification as such has nothing necessarily to do with trans people.
									
									What do you get out of this kind of pedantry? I think we're both aware that "identity politics" comes from black feminism and that the trans movement's conception of identity (that it's a matter of voluntary identification) conflicts with how racial identity works for black people. Race and sex are both involuntary and I reject "gender identity", which depends on voluntary identification. So you're blending rhetorical traditions by talking about "identifying with blackness" in the way you did. I shouldn't have to belabor this. Central to your position is "a woman is someone who identifies as a woman", so it's just gaslighting to pretend like this isn't a central theme. Before the trans movement, there was no presumption that "identifying as" something actually made you that thing.
									
									>It's arguably both, as is gender for that matter. Gender identity and expression are protected categories in some parts of the US so if we're just going off of appeals to American law, your point is moot!
									
									This is so annoying I swear to God. If you're going to drone on like this, at least respond to the evidence I gave already. If it's possible to be wrong in court about your own race, it's not a matter of self-identification, is it? "Gender identity" is explicitly about self-ID, which is different. It's literally not possible to be a trans woman if you don't want to be, whereas you can be black without wanting to be. You're just distracting from your inability to refute this basic point. Talk about how a black person "identifies with" blackness is a matter of their psychological coping, not a matter of what they are.
									
									>Your use of Fanon doesn't make much sense to me
									
									Well, if you got it you wouldn't be lecturing me about how to be black to your liking.
									
									>hence why there is ample anthropological evidence of gender expression being variable geographically and for their being gender expressions and identifications aside from "cis" in different groups around the world.
									
									Ah yes, the thing where heterosexuality is recent and historically contingent but trans is essentially universal across time and space. The anachronism should be embarrassing to anyone interested in history. Leave Joan of Arc and random Roman emperors alone.
									
									>If you are an afropessimist then the logical conclusion for you is to assert that we must destroy the world. That's what the afropessimists say. Instead, you come here and inveigh about afropessimism and shit on trans people.
									
									You'll be relieved to hear that I've been a doomer since like 2007 or 2008. I believe it's too late to prevent the end of the world, so again you've failed to find a gotcha.
									
									>This literally is just bigotry and requires no response as a serious proposition.
									
									Actually, [u/JuggernautAntique953](https://www.reddit.com/user/JuggernautAntique953) says AGP is uncontroversial, accepted, and embraced among "big brain trans." Anyone can go to Kiwi Farms themselves and find literally thousands of pages of screenshots of trans people talking about their fetishes openly. Andrea Long Chu has the Pulitzer Prize.
									
									Your outrage is performative. You're the self-appointed blackness police and also have thoughts on bigotry, which I can't ever take seriously for that reason. It just bugs the shit out of you that you have a nerd interest in a black people thing and you can't force it to be consistent with your white wokeness stuff.
									
									>I haven't ever seen anyone resort to slurs against you so it's odd to me that you feel entitled to be so rude to others.
									
									Gosh, you're so rude, bigot. Why aren't you polite and deferential to me? LOL! Just the other day, I was subjected to some white kid from Yugoslavia on here gloating about his big white dick in the name of Frantz Fanon, so this is not a safe space.
									
									In conclusion, trans is a self-admitted fetish movement and not a real social justice cause and calling me a big old meanie won't change that fact.

	I was also conflicted about perfomrativity's ability to explain deep gender feelings; however, I think if you read their more psychoanalytic arguments they make a good model for how one can feel deeply intertwined with a gendered identity while the gendered roles/subjectivity themselves are constructed by power. I would check out The Psychic Life of Power or Undoing Gender (where transness is specifically a focus).

	As for trans critiques, Jay Prosser has work on gender identity that I think is relevant. Gayle Salamon's Assuming a Body is also a good work of critical phenonenology that addresses trans critiques of performativity while putting forward their understanding of how transgender identity comes to be.
