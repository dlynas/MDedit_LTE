_**The Conquest of Bread**_ ([French](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language"): _La Conquête du Pain_; Russian: Хлѣбъ и воля, <small><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Russian" title="Romanization of Russian">romanized:</a></small> _Khleb i volja_, "Bread and Freedom"; Хлеб и воля in contemporary spelling), also known colloquially as **The Bread Book**, is an 1892 book by the Russian [anarchist communist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_communism "Anarchist communism") [Peter Kropotkin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin "Peter Kropotkin"). Originally written in French, it first appeared as a series of articles in the anarchist journal _[Le Révolté](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_R%C3%A9volt%C3%A9 "Le Révolté")_. It was first published in Paris with a preface by [Élisée Reclus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lis%C3%A9e_Reclus "Élisée Reclus"), who also suggested the title. Between 1892 and 1894, it was serialized in part in the [London](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") journal _[Freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_(British_newspaper) "Freedom (British newspaper)")_, of which Kropotkin was a co-founder.

In the work, Kropotkin identified what he considered to be the defects of the [economic systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_system "Economic system") of [feudalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism "Feudalism") and [capitalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism"), and argued that these systems thrive on and maintain [poverty](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty "Poverty") and [scarcity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity "Scarcity"). He proceeded to propose a more decentralized economic system based on [mutual aid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory) "Mutual aid (organization theory)") and voluntary cooperation, asserting that the tendencies for this kind of organization already exist, both in [evolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "Evolution") and in [human](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human "Human") society.

_The_ _Conquest of Bread_ has become a [classic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic "Classic") of [political](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics "Politics") [anarchist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism") [literature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature "Literature"). It was heavily influential on both the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War") and the [Occupy movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement "Occupy movement").<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

## Background [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Conquest_of_Bread&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")

In 1886, Kropotkin was released from French prison. Fearful of the anarchist scare that was gripping continental Europe following the assassination of [Alexander II](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Russia "Alexander II of Russia") and wishing to focus more time on composing theory and arguing for his revolutionary ideals, Kropotkin moved to London in the same year.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup> Following the death of [Mikhail Bakunin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin "Mikhail Bakunin") in 1876, anarchists desired a prominent and respected theorist to explain their ideas and—after the splitting of the [First International](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_International "First International") between [Marxists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism") and anarchists—Kropotkin wished to formally explain anarchist communism in a way that would clearly differentiate the anarchists from the Marxists, but also help to correct what he saw as flaws in Bakunin's ideology of collectivist anarchism.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> With this aim, Kropotkin spent a great deal of time in London writing multiple books and pamphlets, in between his international speaking tours to the United States and Canada. It was during this time of rapid literary output that Kropotkin wrote _The Conquest of Bread_, which became his most well-known attempt to systematically explain the essential parts of anarchist communism.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup>

Kropotkin originally wrote the text in French and published in the French journal _[Le Révolté](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_R%C3%A9volt%C3%A9 "Le Révolté"),_ where he served as the primary editor. Following its publication in France, Kropotkin published a serialized version in English in the London anarchist journal _[Freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_newspaper "Freedom newspaper")_. The book would later be collected and published as a book in France in 1892 and in England in 1906.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup>

The publication of the text was a watershed moment in anarchist history, being the first time that a completed and in-depth theoretical work of anarchist communist theory was available to the public.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup> The publication of the text shifted the focus of [anarchism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism") from [individualist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualist_anarchism "Individualist anarchism"), [mutualist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(economic_theory) "Mutualism (economic theory)") and [collectivist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivist_anarchism "Collectivist anarchism") strains to [social](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_anarchism "Social anarchism") and [communist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_communism "Anarchist communism") tendencies.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup> This shift would prove to be one of the most enduring changes in the [history of anarchism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_anarchism "History of anarchism") as anarchism developed throughout the 20th century with Kropotkin and _The Conquest of Bread_ as firm reference points.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Summary [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Conquest_of_Bread&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Summary")

### Chapters 1–3: The Right to Well-Being [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Conquest_of_Bread&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Chapters 1–3: The Right to Well-Being")

Throughout the first three chapters, Kropotkin constructs an argument for the common ownership of all intellectual and useful property due to the collective work that went into creating it. Kropotkin does not argue that the product of a worker's labor should belong to the worker. Instead, Kropotkin asserts that every individual product is essentially the work of everyone since every individual relies on the intellectual and physical labor of those who came before them as well as those who built the world around them. Because of this, Kropotkin proclaims that every human deserves an essential right to well-being because every human contributes to the collective social product:<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>

> No more of such vague formulae as "The right to work", or "To each the whole result of his labour." What we proclaim is the Right to Well-Being; Well-Being for All!

Kropotkin further contends that the central obstacle preventing humanity from claiming this right is the state's violent protection of private property. Kropotkin compares this relationship to feudalism, saying that even if the forms have changed, the essential relationship between the propertied and the landless is the same as the relationship between a feudal lord and their serfs. Kropotkin calls for the destruction of the state and the expropriation of all property into the commons, where the right to well-being can be achieved for all people.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>

### Chapters 4–11: Anarchist Communist Society [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Conquest_of_Bread&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Chapters 4–11: Anarchist Communist Society")

Throughout the middle of the book, Kropotkin sketches a picture of what he feels an anarchist communist society could look like. He points to the huge levels of production that modern industrial society achieved in terms of food production, clothing production, and housing production, and he uses this as evidence of the feasibility of an anarchist communist society. More than enough of the essentials are produced for all people, Kropotkin argues; if they were only distributed properly, nobody would have any unmet needs. Kropotkin further argues that with the level of production output being so high people should not have to work more than five hours a day and they should be able to reduce that as much as possible, giving them free time for leisure, socialization, and to work on innovations that would reduce their labor.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>

Near the end of this section, Kropotkin discusses luxury items, recognizing that they are a necessity for a good life and affirming that luxury items would still be produced, even if production was taken under the purview of common need. Kropotkin claims that luxury items would be produced on a collective basis by those most interested in their production. He uses an example of a group of [pianists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pianists "Pianists") dedicating time to building luxury [pianos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pianos "Pianos") with the help of a group of collective [carpenters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpenters "Carpenters") who are interested in [carpentry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentry "Carpentry"). Kropotkin argues that this system of collective production could produce necessary luxury items—on top of the production of the necessities—for everybody to live a fulfilling life.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>

### Chapters 12–17: Objections and Conclusion [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Conquest_of_Bread&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Chapters 12–17: Objections and Conclusion")

In the final chapters, Kropotkin lays out what he feels will be prominent objections to his theory as well as his responses to them. He figures that many critics will claim that people are naturally lazy and they would not work without a profit incentive, even if it is only for five hours and for basic necessities. Kropotkin counters by saying that people are willing to work in jobs they enjoy and given the necessary free time to work on their own, with the guarantee of material stability, people will work willingly on collective gardens or in collective garment factories.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>

Near the end of the work, Kropotkin cautions against the state centralization of industry, warning people against more [authoritarian strands of socialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_socialism "Authoritarian socialism") and claiming that any revolution must guarantee bread and freedom to the workers and revolutionaries. He ends with a long chapter on agriculture, marveling at the many ways in which humans have cultivated and advanced agricultural production, dreaming about the ways that it could be used to feed everybody and guarantee a healthy and happy life for all people.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_5-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:1-5">[5]</a></sup>

## Legacy [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Conquest_of_Bread&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Legacy")

_The Conquest of Bread_ has made an impact which exceeds Kropotkin's own lifetime. It has played a prominent role in the anarchist militias of the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War "Spanish Civil War") as well as inspiring anarchist history, theory and [praxis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_(process) "Praxis (process)") throughout the 20th century. Due to the problems of [Marxism–Leninism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism "Marxism–Leninism") in the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), some thinkers came to regard the book as [prophetic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy "Prophecy"), with Kropotkin anticipating the many pitfalls and [human rights abuses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights "Human rights") that would occur given the centralization of industry.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_6-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:2-6">[6]</a></sup>

After the [2007–2008 financial crisis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008 "Financial crisis of 2007–2008") and the subsequent [Occupy movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement "Occupy movement"), Kropotkin's work took on increased prominence.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_6-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:2-6">[6]</a></sup> [David Graeber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber "David Graeber"), one of the intellectual leaders of the Occupy movement, cited Kropotkin directly as an inspiration for the world the Occupy protesters were attempting to create.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> In 2015, David Priestland, writing for _[The Guardian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian "The Guardian")_, called for a renewed look at Kropotkin and _The Conquest of Bread_ in the West, given the recent [collapse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union") of the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") in 1991 and the global [financial crisis of 2007–2008](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308 "Financial crisis of 2007–08").<sup id="cite_ref-:2_6-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-:2-6">[6]</a></sup>

Since 2018, a loose group of left-leaning [YouTube](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube "YouTube") content creators have collectively been referred to as [BreadTube](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BreadTube "BreadTube"), inspired by the title of the book.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The term "breadpilled" refers to the act of becoming an [anarcho-socialist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-socialism "Anarcho-socialism"), alluding to the [red pill and blue pill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill "Red pill and blue pill") from the 1999 film _[The Matrix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix "The Matrix")_.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>
