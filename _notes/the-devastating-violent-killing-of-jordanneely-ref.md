## The devastating, violent killing of #JordanNeely reflects so much about what is broken in our city:

The inadequacy of quality & accessible mental healthcare. The cost of food and rent that leaves so many New Yorkers hungry and without a safe place to sleep. The unprocessed mass grief & trauma of the pandemic that still has us all on edge, whether we know it or not. The anti-Black racism. The dehumanizing and fear-mongering headlines. The harsh statements from the mayor that tell us anyone behaving out of the ordinary or who looks like they’re struggling is violent and dangerous. 

Jordan’s death is an indictment of the mayor's failed approach to public safety; The mayor's budget spends billions on policing but refuses to adequately invest in housing and healthcare. Jordan Neely was a human being. He was our neighbor. 
His life mattered. He needed care, and Mayor Adams' New York failed to provide it. May Jordan's memory be a blessing.
