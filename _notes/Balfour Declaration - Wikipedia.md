The original letter from Balfour to Rothschild; the declaration reads:

> His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.

The **Balfour Declaration** was a public statement issued by the [British Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Government "British Government") in 1917 during the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War") announcing its support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)"), then an [Ottoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") region with a small minority [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish "Jewish") population. The declaration was contained in a letter dated 2 November 1917 from the United Kingdom's [Foreign Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_Affairs_(UK) "Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (UK)") [Arthur Balfour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Balfour "Arthur Balfour") to [Lord Rothschild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rothschild,_2nd_Baron_Rothschild "Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild"), a leader of the [British Jewish community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Jews "British Jews"), for transmission to the [Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_Federation_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland"). The text of the declaration was published in the press on 9 November 1917.

Immediately following Britain's declaration of war on the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") in November 1914, it began to consider the future of Palestine. Within two months [a memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Future_of_Palestine "The Future of Palestine") was circulated to the [War Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_War_Cabinet "British War Cabinet") by a Zionist member, [Herbert Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Samuel,_1st_Viscount_Samuel "Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel"), proposing the support of Zionist ambitions in order to enlist the support of Jews in the wider war. [A committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bunsen_Committee "De Bunsen Committee") was established in April 1915 by [British Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom") [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith "H. H. Asquith") to determine their policy towards the Ottoman Empire including Palestine. Asquith, who had favoured post-war reform of the Ottoman Empire, resigned in December 1916; his replacement [David Lloyd George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_George "David Lloyd George") favoured partition of the Empire. The first negotiations between the British and the [Zionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") took place at a conference on 7 February 1917 that included [Sir Mark Sykes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sykes "Mark Sykes") and the Zionist leadership. Subsequent discussions led to Balfour's request, on 19 June, that Rothschild and [Chaim Weizmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Weizmann "Chaim Weizmann") submit a draft of a public declaration. Further drafts were discussed by the British Cabinet during September and October, with input from Zionist and [anti-Zionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism "Anti-Zionism") Jews but with no representation from the local population in Palestine.

By late 1917, in the lead-up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a stalemate, with two of [Britain's allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I "Allies of World War I") not fully engaged: the United States had yet to suffer a casualty, and the Russians were in the midst of a [revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution "October Revolution") with [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks "Bolsheviks") taking over the government. A [stalemate in southern Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalemate_in_Southern_Palestine "Stalemate in Southern Palestine") was broken by the [Battle of Beersheba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Beersheba_(1917) "Battle of Beersheba (1917)") on 31 October 1917. The release of the final declaration was authorised on 31 October; the preceding Cabinet discussion had referenced perceived propaganda benefits amongst the worldwide Jewish community for the Allied war effort.

The opening words of the declaration represented the first public expression of support for Zionism by a major political power. The term "national home" had no precedent in international law, and was intentionally vague as to whether a [Jewish state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state "Jewish state") was contemplated. The intended boundaries of Palestine were not specified, and the British government later confirmed that the words "in Palestine" meant that the Jewish national home was not intended to cover all of Palestine. The second half of the declaration was added to satisfy opponents of the policy, who had claimed that it would otherwise prejudice the position of the local population of Palestine and encourage [antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism "Antisemitism") worldwide by "stamping the Jews as strangers in their native lands". The declaration called for safeguarding the civil and religious rights for the [Palestinian Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Arabs "Palestinian Arabs"), who composed the [vast majority of the local population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region) "Demographic history of Palestine (region)"), and also the rights and political status of the Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine. The British government acknowledged in 1939 that the local population's wishes and interests should have been taken into account, and recognised in 2017 that the declaration should have called for the protection of the Palestinian Arabs' political rights.

The declaration had many long-lasting consequences. It greatly increased popular support for [Zionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism "Zionism") within [Jewish communities worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora "Jewish diaspora"), and became a core component of the [British Mandate for Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Palestine "Mandate for Palestine"), the founding document of [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine"). It indirectly led to the emergence of the [State of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel "Israel") and is considered a principal cause of the ongoing [Israeli–Palestinian conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict "Israeli–Palestinian conflict"), often described as the world's most intractable conflict. Controversy remains over a number of areas, such as whether the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to [the Sharif of Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_ibn_Ali_al-Hashimi "Hussein ibn Ali al-Hashimi") in the [McMahon–Hussein correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence "McMahon–Hussein Correspondence").

Early British political support for an increased Jewish presence in the [region of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)") was based upon geopolitical calculations.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERenton20072_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERenton20072-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-3">[i]</a></sup> This support began in the early 1840s<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchölch199244_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTESch%C3%B6lch199244-4">[3]</a></sup> and was led by [Lord Palmerston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_John_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston "Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston"), following the [occupation of Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%E2%80%93Ottoman_War_(1831%E2%80%9333) "Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–33)") and [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasants%27_revolt_in_Palestine "Peasants' revolt in Palestine") by [separatist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism "Separatism") Ottoman governor [Muhammad Ali of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt "Muhammad Ali of Egypt").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStein19615–9_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStein19615%E2%80%939-5">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELiebreich20048–9_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTELiebreich20048%E2%80%939-6">[5]</a></sup> French influence had grown in Palestine and the wider Middle East, and its role as protector of the [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_church "Catholic church") communities [began to grow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A8glement_Organique_(Mount_Lebanon) "Règlement Organique (Mount Lebanon)"), just as Russian influence had grown as protector of the [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox Church") in the same regions. This left Britain without a [sphere of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence "Sphere of influence"),<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStein19615–9_5-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStein19615%E2%80%939-5">[4]</a></sup> and thus a need to find or create their own regional "protégés".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchölch199241_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTESch%C3%B6lch199241-7">[6]</a></sup> These political considerations were supported by a sympathetic evangelical Christian sentiment towards the "[restoration of the Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Zionism "Christian Zionism")" to Palestine among elements of the mid-19th-century British political elite – most notably [Lord Shaftesbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Ashley-Cooper,_7th_Earl_of_Shaftesbury "Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury").<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-9">[ii]</a></sup> The British Foreign Office actively encouraged Jewish emigration to Palestine, exemplified by [Charles Henry Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Henry_Churchill "Charles Henry Churchill")'s 1841–1842 exhortations to [Moses Montefiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Montefiore "Moses Montefiore"), the leader of the British Jewish community.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFriedman1973xxxii_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFriedman1973xxxii-10">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-11">[a]</a></sup>

#### British anti-Semitism

Although other factors played their part, [Jonathan Schneer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Schneer "Jonathan Schneer") says that stereotypical thinking by British officials about Jews also played a role in the decision to issue the Declaration. Robert Cecil, Hugh O’Bierne and Sir Mark Sykes all held an unrealistic view of "world Jewry", the former writing "I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the international power of the Jews." Zionist representatives saw advantage in encouraging such views.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESchneer2010343_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchneer2010343-15">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-16">[12]</a></sup> [James Renton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Renton "James Renton") concurs, writing that the British foreign policy elite, including Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Foreign Secretary A.J. Balfour, believed that Jews possessed real and significant power that could be of use to them in the war.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-17">[13]</a></sup>

### Early Zionism

Zionism arose in the late 19th century in reaction to anti-Semitic and exclusionary nationalist movements in Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECohen198929–31_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTECohen198929%E2%80%9331-18">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-20">[iv]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Gelvin2014_22-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-Gelvin2014-22">[v]</a></sup> [Romantic nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_nationalism "Romantic nationalism") in [Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe "Central Europe") and [Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe "Eastern Europe") had helped to set off the [Haskalah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskalah "Haskalah"), or "Jewish Enlightenment", creating a split in the Jewish community between those who saw Judaism as their religion and those who saw it as their ethnicity or nation.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECohen198929–31_18-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTECohen198929%E2%80%9331-18">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELeVineMossberg2014211_19-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTELeVineMossberg2014211-19">[15]</a></sup> The 1881–1884 [anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Jewish_pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire "Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire") encouraged the growth of the latter identity, resulting in the formation of the [Hovevei Zion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hovevei_Zion "Hovevei Zion") pioneer organizations, the publication of [Leon Pinsker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Pinsker "Leon Pinsker")'s _[Autoemancipation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoemancipation "Autoemancipation")_, and the first major wave of Jewish immigration to Palestine – retrospectively named the "[First Aliyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Aliyah "First Aliyah")".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERhett2015106_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERhett2015106-23">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECohen198931–32_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTECohen198931%E2%80%9332-24">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELeVineMossberg2014211_19-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTELeVineMossberg2014211-19">[15]</a></sup>

The "[Basel program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_program "Basel program")" approved at the 1897 [First Zionist Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Zionist_Congress "First Zionist Congress"). The first line states: "Zionism seeks to establish a home (_Heimstätte_) for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law"

In 1896, [Theodor Herzl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl "Theodor Herzl"), a Jewish journalist living in [Austria-Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary "Austria-Hungary"), published the foundational text of political Zionism, _[Der Judenstaat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Judenstaat "Der Judenstaat")_ ("The Jews' State" or "The State of the Jews"), in which he asserted that the only solution to the "[Jewish Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Question "Jewish Question")" in Europe, including growing anti-Semitism, was the establishment of a state for the Jews.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECohen198934–35_25-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTECohen198934%E2%80%9335-25">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERhett2015107–108_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERhett2015107%E2%80%93108-26">[20]</a></sup> A year later, Herzl founded the [Zionist Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Zionist_Organization "World Zionist Organization"), which at its [first congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Zionist_Congress "First Zionist Congress") called for the establishment of "a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law". Proposed measures to attain that goal included the promotion of Jewish settlement there, the organisation of Jews in the [diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Diaspora "Jewish Diaspora"), the strengthening of Jewish feeling and consciousness, and preparatory steps to attain necessary governmental grants.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERhett2015107–108_26-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERhett2015107%E2%80%93108-26">[20]</a></sup> Herzl died in 1904, 44 years before the establishment of [State of Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel "State of Israel"), the Jewish state that he proposed, without having gained the political standing required to carry out his agenda.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEClevelandBunton2016229_14-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEClevelandBunton2016229-14">[10]</a></sup>

Ottoman government in [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople "Constantinople") began to apply restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine in late 1882, in response to the start of the [First Aliyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Aliyah "First Aliyah") earlier that year.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFriedman199739–40_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFriedman199739%E2%80%9340-56">[44]</a></sup> Although this immigration was creating a certain amount of tension with the local population, mainly among the merchant and [notable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayan_(class) "Ayan (class)") classes, in 1901 the [Sublime Porte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Porte "Sublime Porte") (the Ottoman central government) gave Jews the same rights as Arabs to buy land in Palestine and the percentage of Jews in the population rose to 7% by 1914.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETessler2009144_57-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTETessler2009144-57">[45]</a></sup> At the same time, with growing distrust of the [Young Turks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turks "Young Turks") (Turkish nationalists who had [taken control of the Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turk_Revolution "Young Turk Revolution") in 1908) and the [Second Aliyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Aliyah "Second Aliyah"), [Arab nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism "Arab nationalism") and [Palestinian nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism "Palestinian nationalism") was on the rise; and in Palestine anti-Zionism was a characteristic that unified these forces.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETessler2009144_57-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTETessler2009144-57">[45]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTENeff1995159–164_58-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTENeff1995159%E2%80%93164-58">[46]</a></sup> Historians do not know whether these strengthening forces would still have ultimately resulted in conflict in the absence of the Balfour Declaration.<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-60">[x]</a></sup>

The [British Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom "Cabinet of the United Kingdom") first discussed Palestine at a meeting on 9 November 1914, four days after Britain's declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire, of which the [Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutasarrifate_of_Jerusalem "Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem") – often referred to as Palestine<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBüssow20115_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEB%C3%BCssow20115-62">[49]</a></sup> – was a component.

A month later, Samuel circulated a memorandum entitled _[The Future of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Future_of_Palestine "The Future of Palestine")_ to his Cabinet colleagues.

Prior to this point, no active negotiations with Zionists had taken place, but Sykes had been aware of Zionism, was in contact with [Moses Gaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Gaster "Moses Gaster") – a former President of the English Zionist Federation<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHalpern198748,_133_105-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHalpern198748,_133-105">[83]</a></sup> – and may have seen Samuel's 1915 memorandum.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKedourie201381_102-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKedourie201381-102">[81]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERosen198861_106-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERosen198861-106">[84]</a></sup> On 3 March, while Sykes and Picot were still in Petrograd, [Lucien Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Wolf "Lucien Wolf") (secretary of the Foreign Conjoint Committee, set up by Jewish organizations to further the interests of foreign Jews) submitted to the Foreign Office, the draft of an assurance (formula) that could be issued by the allies in support of Jewish aspirations:

> In the event of Palestine coming within the spheres of influence of Great Britain or France at the close of the war, the governments of those powers will not fail to take account of the historic interest that country possesses for the Jewish community. The Jewish population will be secured in the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, equal political rights with the rest of the population, reasonable facilities for immigration and colonisation, and such municipal privileges in the towns and colonies inhabited by them as may be shown to be necessary.

On 11 March, telegrams<sup id="cite_ref-108"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-108">[l]</a></sup> were sent in Grey's name to Britain's Russian and French ambassadors for transmission to Russian and French authorities, including the formula, as well as:

> The scheme might be made far more attractive to the majority of Jews if it held out to them the prospect that when in course of time the Jewish colonists in Palestine grow strong enough to cope with the Arab population they may be allowed to take the management of the internal affairs of Palestine (with the exception of Jerusalem and the holy places) into their own hands.

Sykes, having seen the telegram, had discussions with Picot and proposed (making reference to Samuel's memorandum<sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-109">[m]</a></sup>) the creation of an Arab Sultanate under French and British protection, some means of administering the holy places along with the establishment of a company to purchase land for Jewish colonists, who would then become citizens with equal rights to Arabs.<sup id="cite_ref-110"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-110">[n]</a></sup>

Shortly after returning from Petrograd, Sykes briefed Samuel, who then briefed a meeting of Gaster, Weizmann and Sokolow. Gaster recorded in his diary on 16 April 1916: "We are offered French-English condominium in Palest\[ine\]. Arab Prince to conciliate Arab sentiment and as part of the Constitution a Charter to Zionists for which England would stand guarantee and which would stand by us in every case of friction ...

#### 1916–17: Change in British Government

In terms of British politics, the declaration resulted from the coming into power of [Lloyd George and his Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_George_ministry "Lloyd George ministry"), which had replaced the [H. H. Asquith led-Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asquith_coalition_ministry "Asquith coalition ministry") in December 1916. Whilst both Prime Ministers were [Liberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK) "Liberal Party (UK)") and both governments were [wartime coalitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government "Coalition government"), Lloyd George and Balfour, appointed as his Foreign Secretary, favoured a post-war partition of the Ottoman Empire as a major British war aim, whereas Asquith and his Foreign Secretary, [Sir Edward Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Grey,_1st_Viscount_Grey_of_Fallodon "Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon"), had favoured its reform.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGutwein2016117–152_118-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGutwein2016117%E2%80%93152-118">[92]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMathew2013231–250_119-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMathew2013231%E2%80%93250-119">[93]</a></sup>

Two days after taking office, Lloyd George told [General Robertson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Robertson,_1st_Baronet "Sir William Robertson, 1st Baronet"), the [Chief of the Imperial General Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_General_Staff_(United_Kingdom) "Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)"), that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of Jerusalem, to impress British public opinion,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWoodward1998119–120_120-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWoodward1998119%E2%80%93120-120">[94]</a></sup> and immediately consulted his War Cabinet about a "further campaign into Palestine when El Arish had been secured."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWoodfin201247–49_121-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWoodfin201247%E2%80%9349-121">[95]</a></sup> Subsequent pressure from Lloyd George, over the reservations of Robertson, resulted in the recapture of the [Sinai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula "Sinai Peninsula") for [British-controlled Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khedivate_of_Egypt "Khedivate of Egypt"), and, with the [capture of El Arish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Magdhaba "Battle of Magdhaba") in December 1916 [and Rafah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Rafa "Battle of Rafa") in January 1917, the arrival of British forces at the southern borders of the Ottoman Empire.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWoodfin201247–49_121-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWoodfin201247%E2%80%9349-121">[95]</a></sup> Following two unsuccessful [attempts to capture Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Gaza "Second Battle of Gaza") between 26 March and 19 April, a six-month [stalemate in Southern Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalemate_in_Southern_Palestine "Stalemate in Southern Palestine") began;<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGrainger200681–108_122-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrainger200681%E2%80%93108-122">[96]</a></sup> the [Sinai and Palestine Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_and_Palestine_Campaign "Sinai and Palestine Campaign") would not make any progress into Palestine until 31 October 1917.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGrainger2006109–114_123-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrainger2006109%E2%80%93114-123">[97]</a></sup>

#### 1917: British-Zionist formal negotiations

Following the change in government, Sykes was promoted into the War Cabinet Secretariat with responsibility for Middle Eastern affairs.

## Approvals

### April to June: Allied discussions

The French position in regard to Palestine and the wider [Syria region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_(region) "Syria (region)") during the lead up to the Balfour Declaration was largely dictated by the terms of the Sykes-Picot Agreement and was complicated from 23 November 1915 by increasing French awareness of the British discussions with the Sherif of Mecca.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBrecher1993642–643_139-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrecher1993642%E2%80%93643-139">[109]</a></sup> Prior to 1917, the British had led the fighting on the southern border of the Ottoman Empire alone, given their neighbouring [Egyptian colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Egypt_under_the_British "History of Egypt under the British") and the French preoccupation with the fighting on the Western Front that was taking place on their own soil.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGrainger200666_140-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrainger200666-140">[110]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWavell196890–91_141-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWavell196890%E2%80%9391-141">[111]</a></sup> Italy's participation in the war, which began following the April 1915 [Treaty of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_(1915) "Treaty of London (1915)"), did not include involvement in the Middle Eastern sphere until the April 1917 [Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_of_Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne "Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne"); at this conference, Lloyd George had raised the question of a British protectorate of Palestine and the idea "had been very coldly received" by the French and the Italians.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016281_142-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016281-142">[112]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGrainger200665_143-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrainger200665-143">[113]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-144"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-144">[q]</a></sup> In May and June 1917, the French and Italians sent [detachments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment_(military) "Detachment (military)") to support the British as they built their reinforcements in preparation for a renewed attack on Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGrainger200666_140-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGrainger200666-140">[110]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWavell196890–91_141-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWavell196890%E2%80%9391-141">[111]</a></sup>

A copy of Lord Rothschild's initial draft declaration, together with its covering letter, 18 July 1917, from the British War Cabinet archives.

By 13 June 1917, it was acknowledged by [Ronald Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_William_Graham "Ronald William Graham"), head of the Foreign Office's Middle Eastern affairs department, that the three most relevant politicians – the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, and the [Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Under-Secretary_of_State_for_Foreign_Affairs "Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs"), [Lord Robert Cecil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil,_1st_Viscount_Cecil_of_Chelwood "Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood") – were all in favour of Britain supporting the Zionist movement;<sup id="cite_ref-169"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-169">[u]</a></sup> on the same day Weizmann had written to Graham to advocate for a public declaration.<sup id="cite_ref-171"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-171">[v]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-172"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-172">[134]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERhett201516_173-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERhett201516-173">[135]</a></sup>

Six days later, at a meeting on 19 June, Balfour asked Lord Rothschild and Weizmann to submit a formula for a declaration.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFriedman1973247_174-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFriedman1973247-174">[136]</a></sup> Over the next few weeks, a 143-word draft was prepared by the Zionist negotiating committee, but it was considered too specific on sensitive areas by Sykes, Graham and Rothschild.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERhett201527_175-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERhett201527-175">[137]</a></sup> Separately, a very different draft had been prepared by the Foreign Office, described in 1961 by [Harold Nicolson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Nicolson "Harold Nicolson") – who had been involved in preparing the draft – as proposing a "sanctuary for Jewish victims of persecution".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERhett201526_176-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERhett201526-176">[138]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStein1961466_177-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStein1961466-177">[139]</a></sup> The Foreign Office draft was strongly opposed by the Zionists, and was discarded; no copy of the draft has been found in the Foreign Office archives.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERhett201526_176-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERhett201526-176">[138]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStein1961466_177-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStein1961466-177">[139]</a></sup>

### September and October: American consent and War Cabinet approval

As part of the War Cabinet discussions, views were sought from ten "representative" Jewish leaders. Those in favour comprised four members of the Zionist negotiating team (Rothschild, Weizmann, Sokolow and Samuel), [Stuart Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Samuel_(politician) "Stuart Samuel (politician)") (Herbert Samuel's elder brother), and [Chief Rabbi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chief_Rabbis_of_the_United_Hebrew_Congregations "List of Chief Rabbis of the United Hebrew Congregations") [Joseph Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hertz "Joseph Hertz"). Those against comprised [Edwin Montagu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Montagu "Edwin Montagu"), [Philip Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Magnus "Philip Magnus"), [Claude Montefiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Montefiore "Claude Montefiore") and [Lionel Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Cohen,_Baron_Cohen "Lionel Cohen, Baron Cohen").

The decision to release the declaration was taken by the British War Cabinet on 31 October 1917. This followed discussion at four War Cabinet meetings (including the 31 October meeting) over the space of the previous two months.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979102_178-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979102-178">[140]</a></sup> In order to aid the discussions, the War Cabinet Secretariat, led by Maurice Hankey, the [Cabinet Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_(United_Kingdom) "Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)") and supported by his [Assistant Secretaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_Secretary "Assistant Secretary")<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEAdelson1995141_179-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAdelson1995141-179">[141]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-180"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-180">[142]</a></sup> – primarily Sykes and his fellow Conservative MP and pro-Zionist [Leo Amery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Amery "Leo Amery") – solicited outside perspectives to put before the Cabinet. These included the views of government ministers, war allies – notably from President Woodrow Wilson – and in October, formal submissions from six Zionist leaders and four non-Zionist Jews.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979102_178-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979102-178">[140]</a></sup>

British officials asked President Wilson for his consent on the matter on two occasions – first on 3 September, when he replied the time was not ripe, and later on 6 October, when he agreed with the release of the declaration.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELebow1968501_181-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTELebow1968501-181">[143]</a></sup>

British War Cabinet minutes approving the release of the declaration, 31 October 1917

Excerpts from the minutes of these four War Cabinet meetings provide a description of the primary factors that the ministers considered:

-   **3 September 1917**: "With reference to a suggestion that the matter might be postponed, \[Balfour\] pointed out that this was a question on which the Foreign Office had been very strongly pressed for a long time past. There was a very strong and enthusiastic organisation, more particularly in the United States, who were zealous in this matter, and his belief was that it would be of most substantial assistance to the Allies to have the earnestness and enthusiasm of these people enlisted on our side. To do nothing was to risk a direct breach with them, and it was necessary to face this situation."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979103_182-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979103-182">[144]</a></sup>
-   **4 October 1917**: "... \[Balfour\] stated that the German Government were making great efforts to capture the sympathy of the Zionist Movement. This Movement, though opposed by a number of wealthy Jews in this country, had behind it the support of a majority of Jews, at all events in Russia and America, and possibly in other countries ... Mr. Balfour then read a very sympathetic [declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambon_letter "Cambon letter") by the French Government which had been conveyed to the Zionists, and he stated that he knew that President Wilson was extremely favourable to the Movement."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979104_183-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979104-183">[145]</a></sup>
-   **25 October 1917**: "... the Secretary mentioned that he was being pressed by the Foreign Office to bring forward the question of Zionism, an early settlement of which was regarded as of great importance."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979105_184-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979105-184">[146]</a></sup>
-   **31 October 1917**: "\[Balfour\] stated that he gathered that everyone was now agreed that, from a purely diplomatic and political point of view, it was desirable that some declaration favourable to the aspirations of the Jewish nationalists should now be made. The vast majority of Jews in Russia and America, as, indeed, all over the world, now appeared to be favourable to Zionism. If we could make a declaration favourable to such an ideal, we should be able to carry on extremely useful propaganda both in Russia and America."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979106_185-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHurewitz1979106-185">[147]</a></sup>

## Drafting

Declassification of British government archives has allowed scholars to piece together the choreography of the drafting of the declaration; in his widely cited 1961 book, [Leonard Stein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Stein_(Liberal_politician) "Leonard Stein (Liberal politician)") published four previous drafts of the declaration.<sup id="cite_ref-Stein664_186-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-Stein664-186">[148]</a></sup>

The drafting began with Weizmann's guidance to the Zionist drafting team on its objectives in a letter dated 20 June 1917, one day following his meeting with Rothschild and Balfour. He proposed that the declaration from the British government should state: "its conviction, its desire or its intention to support Zionist aims for the creation of a Jewish national home in Palestine; no reference must be made I think to the question of the Suzerain Power because that would land the British into difficulties with the French; it must be a Zionist declaration."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGutwein2016117–152_118-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGutwein2016117%E2%80%93152-118">[92]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016219_187-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016219-187">[149]</a></sup>

A month after the receipt of the much-reduced 12 July draft from Rothschild, Balfour proposed a number of mainly technical amendments.<sup id="cite_ref-Stein664_186-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-Stein664-186">[148]</a></sup> The two subsequent drafts included much more substantial amendments: the first in a late August draft by [Lord Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Milner "Alfred Milner") – one of the original five members of Lloyd George's War Cabinet as a [minister without portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_without_portfolio_(United_Kingdom) "Minister without portfolio (United Kingdom)")<sup id="cite_ref-188"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-188">[xvii]</a></sup> – which reduced the geographic scope from all of Palestine to "in Palestine", and the second from Milner and Amery in early October, which added the two "safeguard clauses".<sup id="cite_ref-Stein664_186-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-Stein664-186">[148]</a></sup>

### The "national home for the Jewish people" vs. Jewish state

> "This is a very carefully worded document and but for the somewhat vague phrase 'A National Home for the Jewish People' might be considered sufficiently unalarming ... But the vagueness of the phrase cited has been a cause of trouble from the commencement. Various persons in high positions have used language of the loosest kind calculated to convey a very different impression to the more moderate interpretation which can be put upon the words. President Wilson brushed away all doubts as to what was intended from his point of view when, in March 1919, he said to the Jewish leaders in America, 'I am moreover persuaded that the allied nations, with the fullest concurrence of our own Government and people are agreed that in Palestine shall be laid the foundations of a Jewish Commonwealth.'<sup id="cite_ref-200"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-200">[w]</a></sup> The late [President Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt "Theodore Roosevelt") declared that one of the Allies peace conditions should be that 'Palestine must be made a Jewish State.'

> "If, however, the strict terms of the Balfour Statement are adhered to ... it can hardly be doubted that the extreme Zionist Program must be greatly modified.

The fact came out repeatedly in the Commission's conference with Jewish representatives, that the Zionists looked forward to a practically complete dispossession of the present non-Jewish inhabitants of Palestine, by various forms of purchase."

Balfour Declaration as published in _[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times "The Times")_, 9 November 1917

The declaration represented the first public support for Zionism by a major political power<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECaplan201178_304-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTECaplan201178-304">[240]</a></sup> – its publication galvanized Zionism, which finally had obtained an official charter.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEStein2003129_305-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEStein2003129-305">[241]</a></sup> In addition to its publication in major newspapers, leaflets were circulated throughout Jewish communities. These leaflets were [airdropped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airdrop "Airdrop") over Jewish communities in Germany and Austria, as well as the [Pale of Settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement "Pale of Settlement"), which [had been given to the Central Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk_(Ukraine%E2%80%93Central_Powers) "Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine–Central Powers)") following the Russian withdrawal.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPalestine_Royal_Commission193723_306-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPalestine_Royal_Commission193723-306">[242]</a></sup>

Weizmann had argued that the declaration would have three effects: it would swing Russia to maintain pressure on Germany's [Eastern Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_I) "Eastern Front (World War I)"), since Jews had been prominent in the [March Revolution of 1917](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_Revolution "February Revolution"); it would rally the large Jewish community in the United States to press for greater funding for the [American war effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_entry_into_World_War_I "American entry into World War I"), underway since April of that year; and, lastly, that it would undermine German Jewish support for [Kaiser Wilhelm II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor "Wilhelm II, German Emperor").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWatts2008190a_307-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWatts2008190a-307">[243]</a></sup>

The declaration spurred an unintended and extraordinary increase in the number of adherents of American Zionism; in 1914 the 200 American Zionist societies comprised a total of 7,500 members, which grew to 30,000 members in 600 societies in 1918 and 149,000 members in 1919.<sup id="cite_ref-Reinharz2_308-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-Reinharz2-308">[xxvi]</a></sup> Whilst the British had considered that the declaration reflected a previously established dominance of the Zionist position in Jewish thought, it was the declaration itself that was subsequently responsible for Zionism's legitimacy and leadership.<sup id="cite_ref-310"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-310">[xxvii]</a></sup>

Exactly one month after the declaration was issued, a large-scale celebration took place at the [Royal Opera House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Opera_House "Royal Opera House") – speeches were given by leading Zionists as well as members of the British administration including Sykes and Cecil.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESokolow191999–116_311-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTESokolow191999%E2%80%93116-311">[245]</a></sup> From 1918 until the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War"), Jews in [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine") celebrated [Balfour Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Day "Balfour Day") as an annual national holiday on 2 November.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESorek201525_312-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTESorek201525-312">[246]</a></sup> The celebrations included ceremonies in schools and other public institutions and festive articles in the Hebrew press.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESorek201525_312-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTESorek201525-312">[246]</a></sup> In August 1919 Balfour approved Weizmann's request to name the first post-war settlement in Mandatory Palestine, "[Balfouria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfouria "Balfouria")", in his honour.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTETomes2002198_313-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTETomes2002198-313">[247]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGlass2002199_314-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlass2002199-314">[248]</a></sup> It was intended to be a model settlement for future American Jewish activity in Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGlass2002200_315-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlass2002200-315">[249]</a></sup>

Herbert Samuel, the Zionist MP whose 1915 memorandum had framed the start of discussions in the British Cabinet, was asked by Lloyd George on 24 April 1920 to act as the first [civil governor of British Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioners_for_Palestine_and_Transjordan "High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan"), replacing the [previous military administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_Enemy_Territory_Administration "Occupied Enemy Territory Administration") that had ruled the area since the war.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200194_316-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200194-316">[250]</a></sup> Shortly after beginning the role in July 1920, he was invited to read the _[haftarah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haftarah "Haftarah")_ from [Isaiah 40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_40 "Isaiah 40") at the [Hurva Synagogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurva_Synagogue "Hurva Synagogue") in Jerusalem,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDomnitch2000111–112_317-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDomnitch2000111%E2%80%93112-317">[251]</a></sup> which, according to his memoirs, led the congregation of older settlers to feel that the "fulfilment of ancient prophecy might at last be at hand".<sup id="cite_ref-319"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-319">[an]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200196_320-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200196-320">[253]</a></sup>

The local Christian and Muslim community of Palestine, who constituted [almost 90% of the population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region) "Demographic history of Palestine (region)"), strongly opposed the declaration.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPalin_Commission192011_267-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPalin_Commission192011-267">[211]</a></sup> As described by the Palestinian-American philosopher [Edward Said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Said "Edward Said") in 1979, it was perceived as being made: "(a) by a European power, (b) about a non-European territory, (c) in a flat disregard of both the presence and the wishes of the native majority resident in that territory, and (d) it took the form of a promise about this same territory to another foreign group."<sup id="cite_ref-Said_322-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-Said-322">[xxviii]</a></sup>

> We have noticed yesterday a large crowd of Jews carrying banners and over-running the streets shouting words which hurt the feeling and wound the soul. They pretend with open voice that Palestine, which is the Holy Land of our fathers and the graveyard of our ancestors, which has been inhabited by the Arabs for long ages, who loved it and died in defending it, is now a national home for them ...

### Broader Arab response

In the broader Arab world, the declaration was seen as a betrayal of the British wartime understandings with the Arabs.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWatts2008190a_307-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWatts2008190a-307">[243]</a></sup> The Sharif of Mecca and other Arab leaders considered the declaration a violation of a previous commitment made in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence in exchange for launching the Arab Revolt.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEShlaim2005251–270_116-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShlaim2005251%E2%80%93270-116">[90]</a></sup>

Following the publication of the declaration in an Egyptian newspaper, _[Al Muqattam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Muqattam "Al Muqattam")_,<sup id="cite_ref-aida_329-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-aida-329">[261]</a></sup> the British dispatched Commander [David George Hogarth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_George_Hogarth "David George Hogarth") to see Hussein in January 1918 bearing [the message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogarth_Message "Hogarth Message") that the "political and economic freedom" of the Palestinian population was not in question.<sup id="cite_ref-Khouri_101-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-Khouri-101">[80]</a></sup> Hogarth reported that Hussein "would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, nor was I instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by Great Britain".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200166_330-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200166-330">[262]</a></sup> Hussein had also learned of the Sykes–Picot Agreement when it was leaked by the new [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") government in December 1917, but was satisfied by [two disingenuous messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassett_Letter "Bassett Letter") from Sir [Reginald Wingate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Wingate "Reginald Wingate"), who had replaced McMahon as High Commissioner of Egypt, assuring him that the British commitments to the Arabs were still valid and that the Sykes–Picot Agreement was not a formal treaty.<sup id="cite_ref-Khouri_101-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-Khouri-101">[80]</a></sup>

Continuing Arab disquiet over Allied intentions also led during 1918 to the British [Declaration to the Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_to_the_Seven "Declaration to the Seven") and the Anglo-French Declaration, the latter promising "the complete and final liberation of the peoples who have for so long been oppressed by the Turks, and the setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the free exercise of the initiative and choice of the indigenous populations".<sup id="cite_ref-Khouri_101-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-Khouri-101">[80]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-331"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-331">[263]</a></sup>

### Evolution of British opinion

> "It is said that the effect of the Balfour Declaration was to leave the Moslems and Christians dumbfounded ... It is impossible to minimise the bitterness of the awakening. They considered that they were to be handed over to an oppression which they hated far more than the Turk's and were aghast at the thought of this domination ... Prominent people openly talk of betrayal and that England has sold the country and received the price ... Towards the Administration \[the Zionists\] adopted the attitude of "We want the Jewish State and we won't wait", and they did not hesitate to avail themselves of every means open to them in this country and abroad to force the hand of an Administration bound to respect the "Status Quo" and to commit it, and thereby future Administrations, to a policy not contemplated in the Balfour Declaration ... What more natural than that \[the Moslems and Christians\] should fail to realise the immense difficulties the Administration was and is labouring under and come to the conclusion that the openly published demands of the Jews were to be granted and the guarantees in the Declaration were to become but a dead letter?"

The British policy as stated in the declaration was to face numerous challenges to its implementation in the following years.

British public and government opinion became increasingly unfavourable to state support for Zionism; even Sykes had begun to change his views in late 1918.<sup id="cite_ref-377"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-377">[aq]</a></sup> In February 1922 Churchill telegraphed Samuel, who had begun his role as High Commissioner for Palestine 18 months earlier, asking for cuts in expenditure and noting:

> In both Houses of Parliament there is growing movement of hostility, against Zionist policy in Palestine, which will be stimulated by recent [Northcliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Harmsworth,_1st_Viscount_Northcliffe "Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe") articles.<sup id="cite_ref-379"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-379">[ar]</a></sup> I do not attach undue importance to this movement, but it is increasingly difficult to meet the argument that it is unfair to ask the British taxpayer, already overwhelmed with taxation, to bear the cost of imposing on Palestine an unpopular policy.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200157_380-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200157-380">[307]</a></sup>

Following the issuance of the Churchill White Paper in June 1922, the House of Lords rejected a Palestine Mandate that incorporated the Balfour Declaration by 60 votes to 25, following a motion issued by [Lord Islington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickson-Poynder,_1st_Baron_Islington "John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200158_381-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200158-381">[308]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-382"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-382">[309]</a></sup> The vote proved to be only symbolic as it was subsequently overruled by a vote in the House of Commons following a tactical pivot and variety of promises made by Churchill.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200158_381-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200158-381">[308]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-385"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-385">[xxx]</a></sup>

In February 1923, following the change in government, Cavendish, in a lengthy memorandum for the Cabinet, laid the foundation for a secret review of Palestine policy:

> It would be idle to pretend that the Zionist policy is other than an unpopular one. It has been bitterly attacked in Parliament and is still being fiercely assailed in certain sections of the press. The ostensible grounds of attack are threefold:(1) the alleged violation of the McMahon pledges; (2) the injustice of imposing upon a country a policy to which the great majority of its inhabitants are opposed; and (3) the financial burden upon the British taxpayer ...<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEQuigley2011269_386-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEQuigley2011269-386">[312]</a></sup>

His covering note asked for a statement of policy to be made as soon as possible and that the cabinet ought to focus on three questions: (1) whether or not pledges to the Arabs conflict with the Balfour declaration; (2) if not, whether the new government should continue the policy set down by the old government in the 1922 White Paper; and (3) if not, what alternative policy should be adopted.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHuneidi199833_194-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHuneidi199833-194">[154]</a></sup>

[Stanley Baldwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Baldwin "Stanley Baldwin"), replacing Bonar Law as Prime Minister, in June 1923 set up a cabinet sub-committee whose terms of reference were:

> examine Palestine policy afresh and to advise the full Cabinet whether Britain should remain in Palestine and whether if she remained, the pro-Zionist policy should be continued.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTECohen20106_387-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTECohen20106-387">[313]</a></sup>

The Cabinet approved the report of this committee on 31 July 1923. Describing it as "nothing short of remarkable", Quigley noted that the government was admitting to itself that its support for Zionism had been prompted by considerations having nothing to do with the merits of Zionism or its consequences for Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEQuigley2011279_388-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEQuigley2011279-388">[314]</a></sup> As Huneidi noted, "wise or unwise, it is well nigh impossible for any government to extricate itself without a substantial sacrifice of consistency and self-respect, if not honour."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHuneidi199837_389-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHuneidi199837-389">[315]</a></sup>

The wording of the declaration was thus incorporated into the [British Mandate for Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Palestine "Mandate for Palestine"), a legal instrument that created Mandatory Palestine with an explicit purpose of putting the declaration into effect and was finally formalized in September 1923.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERenton201616_390-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERenton201616-390">[316]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEPalestine_Royal_Commission193731_391-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPalestine_Royal_Commission193731-391">[317]</a></sup> Unlike the declaration itself, the Mandate was legally binding on the British government.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERenton201616_390-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERenton201616-390">[316]</a></sup> In June 1924, Britain made its report to the Permanent Mandates Commission for the period July 1920 to the end of 1923 containing nothing of the candor reflected in the internal documents; the documents relating to the 1923 reappraisal stayed secret until the early 1970s.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEQuigley2011280–2_392-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEQuigley2011280%E2%80%932-392">[318]</a></sup>

An accompanying Foreign Office note asserted that the primary authors of the declaration were Balfour, Sykes, Weizmann, and Sokolow, with "perhaps Lord Rothschild as a figure in the background", and that "negotiations seem to have been mainly oral and by means of private notes and memoranda of which only the scantiest records seem to be available."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200161–64_394-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHuneidi200161%E2%80%9364-394">[320]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHuneidi2001256_395-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHuneidi2001256-395">[321]</a></sup>

Charles Henry Churchill's first letter, in 1841, intended to catalyse an interest in Jewish emigration to Palestine: "Supposing that you and your colleagues should at once and earnestly interest yourselves upon this important subject of the recovery of your ancient country, it appears to me (forming my opinions upon the present attitude of affairs in the Turkish Empire) that it could only be as subjects of the Porte that you could commence to regain a footing in Palestine."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFriedman1973xxxii_10-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFriedman1973xxxii-10">[8]</a></sup>
2.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_ref-38 "Jump up")** According to Weizmann's memoir, the conversation went as follows: "Mr. Balfour, supposing I was to offer you Paris instead of London, would you take it?" He sat up, looked at me, and answered: "But Dr. Weizmann, we have London." "That is true," I said, "but we had Jerusalem when London was a marsh." He ... said two things which I remember vividly. The first was: "Are there many Jews who think like you?" I answered: "I believe I speak the mind of millions of Jews whom you will never see and who cannot speak for themselves." ... To this he said: "If that is so you will one day be a force." Shortly before I withdrew, Balfour said: "It is curious. The Jews I meet are quite different." I answered: "Mr. Balfour, you meet the wrong kind of Jews".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEWeizmann1949111_37-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWeizmann1949111-37">[28]</a></sup>
3.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_ref-42 "Jump up")** Weizmann's notes of the meeting described that: "\[James\] thought that the Palestinian aspirations of the Jews will find a very favourable response in Government circles, which would support a project like that, both from a humanitarian and an English political point of view. The formation of a strong Jewish community in Palestine would be considered as a valuable political asset. He therefore thought that the demands which only amount to asking for an encouragement of colonization of Jews in Palestine are too modest and would not appeal sufficiently strongly to Statesmen. One should ask for something which is more than that and which tends towards the formation of a Jewish State."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGutwein2016120–130_41-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGutwein2016120%E2%80%93130-41">[31]</a></sup> Gutwein interpreted this discussion as follows: "James's recommendation that the Zionists should not stop at the demand for settlement of Jews in Palestine, but radicalize their demands for a Jewish state, reflected the political contrast between the reformists, who were prepared to support settlement of Jews in Palestine as part of the reorganization of the Ottoman Empire, and the radicals, who viewed a Jewish state as a means of partitioning it. Although James contended that the demand for a Jewish state would help in gaining the British statesmen's support, in view of Asquith's and Grey's opposition to this demand, it seems that the inaccuracy if not the misleading tenor of James's advice was meant to enlist Weizmann, and through him the Zionist movement, to assist the radicals and Lloyd George."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGutwein2016120–130_41-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGutwein2016120%E2%80%93130-41">[31]</a></sup>

The Jews would have to bring sacrifices and he was prepared to do so. At this point I ventured to ask in which way the plans of Mr. Samuel were more ambitious than mine. Mr. Samuel preferred not to enter into a discussion of his plans, as he would like to keep them 'liquid', but he suggested that the Jews would have to build railways, harbours, a university, a network of schools, etc. ...

In the survey we made of all the various prospective requirements, it soon became clear that the supplies of wood alcohol for the manufacture of acetone would prove quite insufficient to meet the increasing demands, particularly in 1916 ... While I was casting about for some solution of the difficulty, I ran against the late C. P. Scott, Editor of the Manchester Guardian ... I took his word about Professor Weizmann and invited him to London to see me ... He could produce acetone by a fermentation process on a laboratory scale, but it would require some time before he could guarantee successful production on a manufacturing scale. In a few weeks' time he came to me and said: "The problem is solved."... When our difficulties were solved through Dr. Weizmann's genius I said to him: 'You have rendered great service to the State, and I should like to ask the Prime Minister to recommend you to His Majesty for some honour.' He said: 'There is nothing I want for myself.' 'But is there nothing we can do as a recognition of your valuable assistance to the country?' I asked.  He replied: 'Yes, I would like you to do something for my people.' He then explained his aspirations as to the repatriation of the Jews to the sacred land they had made famous. That was the fount and origin of the famous declaration about the National Home for Jews in Palestine. As soon as I became Prime Minister I talked the whole matter over with Mr. Balfour, who was then Foreign Secretary. As a scientist he was immensely interested when I told him of Dr. Weizmann's achievement. We were anxious at that time to gather Jewish support in neutral countries, notably in America. Dr. Weizmann was brought into direct contact with the Foreign Secretary.

In 1916 all this seems to have been forgotten. The Sykes–Picot Agreement made no reference to the Sherif of Mecca, and, so far as our five documents are concerned, he has never been heard of since.

The Roumanians had been crushed. The Russian Army was demoralized. The French Army was unable at the moment to take the offensive on a large scale. The Italians had sustained a great defeat at Caporetto. Millions of tons of British shipping had been sunk by German submarines. No American divisions were yet available in the trenches. In this critical situation it was believed that Jewish sympathy or the reverse would make a substantial difference one way or the other to the Allied cause. In particular Jewish sympathy would confirm the support of American Jewry, and would make it more difficult for Germany to reduce her military commitments and improve her economic position on the eastern front ... The Zionist leaders \[Mr. Lloyd George informed us\] gave us a definite promise that, if the Allies committed themselves to giving facilities for the establishment of a national home for the Jews in Palestine, they would do their best to rally Jewish sentiment and support throughout the world to the Allied cause.

### Explanatory notes and scholarly perspectives

1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_ref-3 "Jump up")** Renton described this as follows: "A crucial aspect of this depiction of the Declaration as a product of British benevolence, as opposed to realpolitik, was that the British had a natural and deep-rooted concern for the rights of Jews and specifically their national restoration, which was an ingrained part of British culture and history. Presented in this way, the Declaration was shown to be a natural, almost preordained event. Hence, Zionism was presented not just as the _[telos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos_(philosophy) "Telos (philosophy)")_ of Jewish history but also of British history. The tendency of nationalist and Zionist histories to develop towards a single point of destiny and redemption allowed for, indeed required, such an explanation. The myth of British 'proto-Zionism', which has had such a longstanding influence on the historiography of the Balfour Declaration, was thus produced, so as to serve the needs of Zionist propagandists working for the British Government."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERenton200785_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTERenton200785-2">[2]</a></sup>

4.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_ref-20 "Jump up")** LeVine and Mossberg describe this as follows: "The parents of Zionism were not Judaism and tradition, but anti-Semitism and nationalism. The ideals of the French Revolution spread slowly across Europe, finally reaching the Pale of Settlement in the Russian Empire and helping to set off the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. This engendered a permanent split in the Jewish world, between those who held to a halachic or religious-centric vision of their identity and those who adopted in part the racial rhetoric of the time and made the Jewish people into a nation. This was helped along by the wave of pogroms in Eastern Europe that set two million Jews to flight; most wound up in America, but some chose Palestine. A driving force behind this was the Hovevei Zion movement, which worked from 1882 to develop a Hebrew identity that was distinct from Judaism as a religion."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELeVineMossberg2014211_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTELeVineMossberg2014211-19">[15]</a></sup>

All nationalisms arise in opposition to some 'other'. Why else would there be the need to specify who you are? And all nationalisms are defined by what they oppose. As we have seen, Zionism itself arose in reaction to anti-Semitic and exclusionary nationalist movements in Europe. It would be perverse to judge Zionism as somehow less valid than European anti-Semitism or those nationalisms. Furthermore, Zionism itself was also defined by its opposition to the indigenous Palestinian inhabitants of the region. Both the 'conquest of land' and the 'conquest of labor' slogans that became central to the dominant strain of Zionism in the Yishuv originated as a result of the Zionist confrontation with the Palestinian 'other'."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGelvin201493_21-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGelvin201493-21">[16]</a></sup>

According to his biographer he was interested enough in Zionism at the end of 1905 to allow his Jewish constituency party chairman, Charles Dreyfus, to organise a meeting with Weizmann. It is possible that he was intrigued by the rejection by the Zionist Congress of the 'Uganda' offer.

"You will be charged before the bar of history," he challenged Nordau… From approximately 1:30 p.m. on Sunday, July 30, 1905, a Zionist would henceforth be defined as someone who adhered to the Basel Program and the only "authentic interpretation" of that program restricted settlement activity exclusively to Palestine.

It spurred an impressive growth in organized membership: from 7,500 in 200 Zionist societies in 1914 to 30,000 in 600 societies in 1918. One year later, the number of members reached 149,000. In addition, the FAZ and the PZC collected millions of dollars during the war years.

He accused German Zionists of having betrayed Germany during the war by supporting Britain's Balfour Declaration and pro-Zionist policies and charged that they had actively worked for a German defeat and the Versailles settlement to obtain a Jewish National Home in Palestine.

During a year of fruitless discussions, the AJC would only agree only to a limited convention of specific organizations, rather than a congress based on democratic elections. In March 1916, therefore, the Zionists invited a number of other organizations to set up a congress. The internal strife among American Jewry, which had been so widely feared, broke out in full force ... The elections were held in June, two months after the United States had entered the war; 325,000 voted, 75,000 of whom were from the Zionist workers' camp. This was an impressive demonstration of the ability of the immigrant Zionists to rally massive support. Immediately after came President Wilson's suggestion to Wise not to hold the congress while the war was on, and the opening session was thus postponed from 2 September 1917, until "peace negotiations will be in prospect".

Now, it was Sykes who approached Weizmann and Sokolow and requested their assistance to advance radical aims. The co-opting of Weizmann and the Zionist-radicals into Lloyd George's administration transformed them from lobbyists into partners, and Sykes used their help to promote three major goals of the radical policy: the fight against Wilson's "peace without victory" policy; the establishment of "Greater Armenia" as a Russian protectorate that included Turkish Armenia; and the replacement of joint British-French rule in Palestine, in the spirit of the Sykes–Picot Agreement, with an exclusive British protectorate."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGutwein2016117–152_118-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGutwein2016117%E2%80%93152-118">[92]</a></sup>

Although Zionist enterprise in Palestine was defined as "rebellion" against God and traditional faith in Redemption.
