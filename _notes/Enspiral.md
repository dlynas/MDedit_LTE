## What’s your ‘meaningful work’ to do in the world?

You can do work you love, with people you love, on the biggest issues of our time and get paid well for it. At Enspiral we encourage and support each other to do just that.

We’re a collective of individuals who not only believe in, but practice a new way of organising.

### We share money

We add money into the middle and collectively decide how to spend it using facilitated Co-budgeting.

## Better work. Together.

We wrote a book! Learn how the power of community can transform your business.

At the DNA level, Enspiral is nothing but a group of individuals who got together because of a shared purpose — and turned it into action.

### Community.

As a laboratory of new ways of organizing, we want nothing more than to expand our impact. Enspiral is a network of people supporting each other to have more impact.

### Support.

From software to facilitation to activism, the entrepreneurs of Enspiral have created businesses that help the world and support the network while doing so.
