## The top 10% of Americans own 89% of the stock. In my new book #AlgebraofWealth I explain how stock ownership is key to wealth accretion. Don’t rely on your employer’s 401(k). You need your own investments in addition to that — broad market indexes that are safe/diversified and that will give you the average 8-10% that the market grows year on year. 

You can start with any amount of money. Make investing (in broad funds) a priority.
