###  I want to make my home and appliances more energy efficient

When households need to replace appliances or make home repairs, they can use tax credits for energy efficient improvements that save them money in the long run. These efficiency improvements include upgraded windows, doors, insulation, and other home weatherization services; or highly-efficient heating and cooling appliances like heat pumps, central air conditioners, and water heaters.

### I need to replace my furnace or air conditioner

When homes need to replace their heating or cooling systems, families can get tax credits for efficient heat pumps that ensure comfortable home temperatures. By doing the job of both a furnace and air conditioner, heat pumps work to keep homes warm in the winter and cool in the summer.
