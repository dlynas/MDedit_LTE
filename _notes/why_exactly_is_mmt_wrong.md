	The biggest issue is that despite calling itself a "theory", MMT really doesn't act like a scientific theory at all. Specifically, they don't have a testable, falsifiable hypothesis that we can compare against mainstream theory (/[u/Integralds](https://www.reddit.com/user/Integralds) [makes this points quite well here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/9kulc8/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/e72l0o7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). Ultimately, any comparison is difficult until they get more specific in what they think.

	There have been lots of good articles trying to assess assertions made by MMT supporters. [This article by Steve Ambler](https://financialpost.com/opinion/sorry-modern-monetary-theory-doesnt-mean-we-can-just-run-the-presses-and-print-off-scads-more-cash) is the simplest and easiest read if you don't know a ton of economics (it is, however, less comprehensive). In the slightly more complex category, [this post by Nick Rowe](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2011/04/reverse-engineering-the-mmt-model.html) and [this critical article](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/monetary-theory/how-reliable-modern-monetary-theory-guide-policy) by Scott Sumner and Patrick Horan are both good.

					MMT isn't a policy. MMT is a description of how the world works right now, just like New Keynesianism or neo-Wicksellianism or fisherianism or whatever. [MMT is fundamentally about monetary policy being useless](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/itbu98/why_exactly_is_mmt_wrong/g5flqih). They talk about fiscal policy and accounting identities a lot to obfuscate the discussion and mislead people. Do not let them get away with bad monetary policy takes the entire framework relies on them.

			> I thought their testable hypothesis is if there is still unexploited productive capacity then we don't get inflation even if we print a bunch of money as that will get used up first 
			
			OK, but that's basically just a simplified version of the [Phillip's Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve), which has been widely tested for decades and is very much standard macro-economics (though our view on inflation is evolving today).

					The Phillip's Curve says inflation and unemployment have an inverse relationship--.i.e when unemployment falls to low levels (as the economy reaches capacity), inflation rises.
					
					Does that mean we can print infinite amounts when we're below capacity? No, the Phillip's Curve is just one factor that influences inflation in the short run. In the long run, inflation will be determined by the money supply (this is long-run money neutrality).  And if the government decided to print a bunch of money in a recession, it might cause inflation immediately (though it would depend on expectations). 
					
					You can quite easily see many situations in developing countries where inflation actually rises during an economic downturn (which is not what a simple Phillip's Curve model would predict) due to this.

				* üü™ **[Elkram](https://www.reddit.com/user/Elkram)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 6 _(2020-09-15 19:11:42)_

					Well the idea is that if the only testable hypothesis a theory is able to come up with is something that's adopted by the mainstream already, then what exactly is the point of the theory? Occam's razor slices hard on coming up with new ways to explain things we already understand unless those new explanations can provide answers to things we didn't understand previously. MMT does not. Nor does it claim to. It's pseudo science that claims that maybe if we just opened our eyes to the possibilities there might be something new. That's not science, that's wishful thinking at best and a political wolf in sheep's clothing at worst.

			I think a good policy response to MMT is to think about it's implications. MMT holds that inflation will be controlled via taxation which is handled by an elected legislative body. So in a time of rising prices do you think an elected official is going to support raising taxes?

					I couldn't read your link as it was asking me to sign up for a registration which I'm don't want to do. If you mean how MMT views the use of taxation to control inflation, because it absolutely does. New Economic Perspectives is a major hub of academic MMT laid their views out in 2014.
					
					[**Further, the second reason to have taxes is to reduce aggregate demand**. If we look at the United States today, the federal government spending is somewhat over 20% of GDP, while tax revenue is somewhat less‚Äîsay 17%. The net injection coming from the federal government is thus about 3% of GDP. If we eliminated taxes (and held all else constant) the net injection might rise toward 20% of GDP. That is a huge increase of aggregate demand, and could cause inflation. Ideally, it is best if tax revenue moves countercyclically increasing in expansion and falling in recession. That helps to make the government‚Äôs net contribution to the economy countercyclical, which helps to stabilize aggregate demand.](https://neweconomicperspectives.org/2014/05/taxes-mmt-approach.html).
					
					And given that in the US it is the legislature which is the only body with the constitutional power to raise taxes I don't think I've mischaracterized the conventional MMT view.

						It is a good paper that covers this topic well, but I will summarize to an extent. First, to address your comment. Yes, taxes do offset spending in terms of aggregate demand. That is one purpose of taxation - to provide fiscal space for federal spending. In general taxes act as a counter-cyclical automatic stabilizer much in the same way that food stamps do, but on the opposite end.
						
						However, to you original comment. you seem to take the view that MMT says that taxes should be raised and lowered in real time like a thermostat to get just the right temperature. This is the part that is incorrect.
						The MMT view is that the analysis for a given policy proposal should be done on the front end and include any necessary offsets from the start. If you look at the analysis that was done for the GND for instance, you will see this type of consideration in lieu of the standard CBO analysis and how the deficit is affected.
						That can be viewed here: http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_931.pdf
						
						Additionally, MMT includes a employed buffer stock as a price stabilizing mechanism in contract to the current unemployed buffer stock. This is also a counter-cyclical measure intended to maintain full employment while stabilizing prices.
						
						Here is an excerpt from the article that discusses other types of demand management:
						
						"First, when we suggest that a budget constraint be replaced by an inflation constraint, we are not suggesting that all inflation is caused by excess demand. Indeed, from our view, excess demand is rarely the cause of inflation. Whether it's businesses raising profit margins or passing on costs, or it‚Äôs Wall Street speculating on commodities or houses, there are a range of sources of inflation that aren‚Äôt caused by the general state of demand and aren‚Äôt best regulated by aggregate demand policies.
						
						Thus, if inflation is rising because large corporations have decided to use their pricing power to increase profit margins at the expense of the public, reducing demand may not be the most appropriate tool. The recent controversies over rising housing rents and drug prices demonstrate that we need alternative tools in place to manage the power of big business and ensure their pricing policies are consistent with public purpose. The experience of the last decade inadvertently reflects the potential strength of alternative inflation-fighting tools, as one of the reasons inflation has remained below target for the past ten years is legislated cuts to medicare and medicaid payments.
						
						Because of the pricing power of big companies, whichever administrative agency or agencies is responsible for managing aggregate demand should not be responsible for overall inflation on its own. It should either share joint responsibility for keeping inflation on target with other agencies responsible for regulating business pricing power or new price indices should be constructed that exclude concentrated markets where prices are clearly acyclical.
						
						Second, we do not believe that any and all inflation that does result from excessive demand can and should be addressed by higher taxes. This is a distortion of our view, as years of publications can attest. When MMT says that a major role of taxes is to help offset demand rather than generate revenue, we are recognising that taxes are a critical part of a whole suite of potential demand offsets, which also includes things like tightening financial and credit regulations to reduce bank lending, market finance, speculation and fraud.
						
						Assessing the potential inflationary effect of new spending proposals also requires seriously assessing how underutilised our existing resources are. This requires detailed, expert analysis from a range of industry analysts; not just statistical regressions on aggregate economic data by macroeconomists."

		I went through that list of papers and it seems that many of them are not antithetical to MMT. In fact, many of them support the MMT framework like [this](https://www.ecb.europa.e[u/pub](https://www.reddit.com/user/pub)/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp2013.en.pdf) paper that explores spending habits.
		
		In the Scott Sumner article, just one paragraph in, they claim:
		
		>Therefore, the Federal Reserve (Fed) is more likely to continue adhering to its mandate and refuse to monetize the debt. In that case, however, the burden of deficit spending would fall on future taxpayers.
		
		This certainly didn't age well. Remember repocalypse in September 2019 when the Fed [did just that](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_191011) or, just generally speaking, the enormous balance sheets we've seen since the GFC? If people are looking for proof that central banks will accommodate whatever deficits are thrown at them, they don't need to look further than the last 10 years of central banking.

			They aren't supposed to oppose MMT. They're examples of real economic theories that provided a clear hypothesis and then proved that hypothesis empirically. Something MMT has failed to do.

			The operations described here are not even remotely the same as what MMT is advocating for (which involves eliminating central bank independence and allowing the government to print money freely as they see fit). They went over this later in the article.
			
			The central bank will do what is necessary to keep inflation near target--this sometimes involves OMO's and QE when appropriate (such as now). This is very much part of mainstream accepted economics. They will not freely monetize deficits to the government's preference.

					> We just have to assess the inflationary impact of our policies and not worry about the spurious "we are burdening our children with so much debt". 
					
					Right now, we don't have to do that since the Federal Reserve handles inflation. Of course, we could adjust laws to change that--but I fail to see how removing a long-run financial constraint and replacing it with an inflation constraint puts us any further ahead. It would seem we're in the same position as before where the government is faced with a trade-off.
					
					> Where does one draw the line between OMOs and monetizing the deficit? 
					
					"Monetizing the deficit" can be a broad phrase encompassing many things. Differentiating between what MMT is proposing: this action was undertaken by an independent central bank at their own discretion (this is not a trivial difference). Additionally, it should be noted that this debt isn't cancelled--the Federal Reserve keeps the bond and may very well sell it back to private actors at some point in the future. When the bond matures, they still have to pay it back.
					
					If all MMT was proposing was the use of traditional OMO's / QE, then the entire discussion would be redundant as these policies are already used.

						If the bond matures while on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet isn't it effectively "canceling the debt"? Under current law, the [Federal Reserve's profits are directed back to the Treasury](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20190110a.htm), so coupon payments made to the Federal Reserve as they hold the bond would flow back to the Treasury (minus operating costs). Structurally, debt is cancelled. 
						
						Though, I guess it could be argued that it isn't "Debt Monetization" since it is more a consequence of the Fed's attempts at pushing down interest rates rather than a concerted effort to cancel government debt.

								Yes, but the interest paid on the bonds held flows back to the treasury during the life of the bonds, right? So, the bonds acquired through Treasury Rollover will be new government debt that happens to equal the par value of the SOMA held bonds maturing that day. It seems like the debt is still effectively cancelled as the bonds acquired through rollover reduces the amount of bonds available to the private sector, it isn't like new debt is issued just for the sole purpose of being used for a Treasury rollover. Or am I misunderstanding how Treasury Rollovers work?
								
								The point I'm getting at is that the Treasury's cost to service $1 of debt held by the Federal Reserve is far lower than the cost to service $1 of debt held by the private sector since the Federal Reserve sends its profits back to the Treasury.

									Kind of, but they also have to pay interest on the reserves they exchanged for the Treasury initially (remittances are paid post expenses). It saves the government a bit on interest while the Fed holds it, but the debt will never be cancelled and eventually the Fed will likely sell the debt back to the private sector.
									
									When I refer to the debt being cancelled, I'm referring to a situation where the central bank just hands the government money--no strings attached, no need to pay it back.

							Yes this the purpose of a politically independent central bank. It forces the government to print money even when politicians don't want to print money! Conversely, it stops the government from printing money even when politicians want to print money!

				A big problem is there is no consensus on what MMT is or is not. Certain heterodox economists such as Warren Mosler are held up as founding figureheads, but Mosler‚Äôs work goes back to the 70s and the field didn‚Äôt really break out until post-2008. It is now hard to keep track of what arguments are actually being made when the term MMT is invoked.  
				
				There is also too much ideology caught up in all this. Orthodox economics leans heavily toward Milton Friedman-style *laissez faire* capitalism. Econ people are loathe to admit this though, and I always get downvoted and ridiculed for bringing up the basic fact that academia as well as the mods on this subreddit are ideologically biased towards the ideas espoused in *Capitalism and Freedom*. There was a post a few days ago that asked why economics leans further right than others social science fields. All the answers were some variation of the claims that a) economists aren‚Äôt right-wing, and b) social scientists aren‚Äôt left-wing. These responses are disingenuous. Social science fields are definitely far less inclined to support *laissez faire* capitalism than typical economists are. That‚Äôs what people mean when they talk about right/left in economics. Almost all of academia is socially liberal though. I responded with a long explanation of Friedman‚Äôs influence and the neoliberal revolution, but it never got approved and the thread was locked.
				
				Anyway, from what I‚Äôve observed, the people who are drawn to MMT are much more ideologically left wing than the average orthodox economist. Yes, some of them have made outlandish claims that are wrong. But there have been a lot of unprecedented economic events since 2007 and the weak recovery from the subprime mortgage crisis. Certainly no average orthodox economist in the 1990s or mid 2000s would have predicted that interest rates would continue plummeting and go negative all across the world. Nor would they have predicted that the massive government deficits and Central Bank balance sheet expansions would lead to little pressure on CPI and PCE. Sure, there were a lot of orthodox guys who didn‚Äôt think QE would cause massive inflation, but there were also plenty who did. Moreover, there is still no consensus answer as to the best way for policymakers to stimulate growth. MMTers have helped lead a resurgence of Keynesian ideas that reject the ‚Äúmonetarism and supply side only‚Äù approach that emerged from the Reagan era. This is in contrast to people like this subreddit‚Äôs idol Scott Sumner, who thinks monetary policy is all you need and the Fed simply isn‚Äôt driving rates low enough.
				
				MMTers also are more apt to accept the notion that QE boosts asset prices disproportionately more than it increases wages, again mostly for ideological reasons. In a time when we have so many unprecedented economic events happening seemingly every few years, people often retreat to ideology whenever there‚Äôs a policy disagreement, and that‚Äôs a huge part of what this orthodox vs. MMT squabble really is. The field of economics is gradually coming around to the notion that Reagan era policy tools are insufficient for the 21st century. Honestly, MMTers and orthodox economists agree on a lot more than I think the average person realizes. But orthodox guys still feel compelled to lambast MMT as crockpot econ even though the Keynesian MMT resurgence is clearly making a difference. The $1200 COVID-19 stimulus checks weren‚Äôt the result of economists focused on monetary policy and tax cuts. I‚Äôm reminded of the Schopenhauer quote ‚ÄúAll truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.‚Äù

						> market failures are a key part of any econ 101 book or course.
						
						The tragedy is that despite this fact, the simplicity and elegance of the neoclassical model means there's an overwhelming tendency to paper over market failures with preposterous excuses: "governments can't pick winners", "economics is concerned with total output, not distribution", "competitive markets do not mandate competitors", "economies of scale justify mergers by companies that admit they're purchasing market power", "you may think companies are under a mountain of debt and that a fifth of companies are zombified, but monetary effects are illusory: every debt is balanced by an equal credit", "comparative advantage doesn't just mean every nation can benefit but every nation always benefits from free trade", "capital controls are justifiable only once crises are already underway", "investments from free flows of capital outweigh the effects of capital flight and unending financial crises".
						
						And despite misgivings in academia, economics is still taught to undergraduates (ie future financial policymakers) as though an optimal market model's robustness compensated for its irrelevance. The bias of bachelor holders in economics is so strong that we're still debating the merits of the most minimal interventions like a Tobin Tax, or whether tech giants with 90% market shares should be treated as oligopolies.
						
						When in a position to reverse market failures, "do no harm" becomes every economist's excuse to "do no good". The ultimate example was Olivier Blanchard's insistence that IMF policies that plunged Greece into a catastrophic depression were somehow in its interest (wishing apparently makes it so).

						You say this as a guy with a username that comes from a phrase popularized by right wingers like Ben Shapiro‚Äîso I‚Äôd say you just inadvertently provided more support for my opinion.

						This is a straw man and it doesn‚Äôt require much effort to see why. Modern Democrats are neoliberals. They are economically right wing and socially left-wing, and they bear very little resemblance to the party pre-Carter, much less the New Deal Coalition. There has been a massive shift such that poor southern states‚Äîwhich formed the core of the Democratic base from Jackson until LBJ‚Äînow form the core base of the Republicans. The Clintonites transformed the Democrats into a party that more or less agrees with Reagan era dogma but just wants a bit bigger welfare state. Mitt Romney was outflanking Pelosi from the left on the COVID stimulus checks. There is widespread agreement, especially amongst younger leftists, that the current leadership of the Democratic Party is economically right wing from a historical perspective. The fact that you don‚Äôt seem to believe or be aware of this says to me you don‚Äôt even know where the boundaries are being drawn here.

								It is not false whatsoever. We seem to disagree on what "leans heavily" means. Not to mention, the whole point of my post is to say that MMTers have been at the vanguard of a Keynesian resurgence that has affected the entire field. So while Friedman's influence is finally waning, it was practically hegemonic for 30 years.

								Once again, you undermine your own argument by bringing up a topic that supports everything I've been saying. Economists were overwhelmingly against the minimum wage until quite recently.

								If you are seriously claiming that economists over the last 50 years have carefully extracted Friedman's ideology from his entire body of work and weren't at all influenced by the ideas espoused in *Capitalism and Friedman*, you are a liar. I know you don't believe that, because I honestly don't believe you are a fool, and only a fool would say such a thing and believe it. Not to mention, the rightward shift in economics was hardly restricted to Friedman. The most extreme case of a Chicago School right winger and Friedman devotee would be Thomas Sowell. If nothing else, Friedman is the poster child for a phenomenon that spanned oceans and lead to the most monumental political realignment in a century. Do you think it's just chance that Friedman's career coincided with the Reagan Revolution? Is it a coincidence that an Ayn Rand disciple ran the Fed from 1987-2006? Friedman's movement is finally falling out of favor, but the idea that the field of economics insulated itself from any and all ideological biases for the last 50 years is just silly. Friedman is easily the most influential American economist *of all time*. He was a celebrity and inspired countless academics who followed him.

								Okay now I know for a fact you are trolling. Besides the fact that half the things you list are cultural leftist objectives (free college, gun control, immigration?), the claim that *Joe Biden* is the most leftist presidential candidate of all time is just unbelievably, ridiculously, outlandishly comical. Ever hear of FDR's Economic Bill of Rights? Are you familiar with William Jennings Bryan and the election of 1900? And of course there's Eugene Debs--an out-and-out communist--who received 6% of the national vote in 1912. Joe Biden has spent his entire 50-year career in politics championing corporate rights and unraveling the legacy of the New Deal. Do I need to show you a list of his corporate donors? Are you aware he hails from corporate-friendly Delaware? He has been arguably the most important Democratic leader [pulling the entire party rightward](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-biden-senate-record-controversies-20190318-story.html). Right now his campaign is quite obviously pandering to skeptical Millennials, and it's not hard to read between the lines and see [he doesn't actually plan to change a thing](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/07/joe-biden-wall-street-donors-blackstone). Actually scratch that, he literally said *"nothing will fundamentally change."* Oh, and did I forget to mention the guy is a sub-20 MoCA when he isn't pumped full of  amphetamines and modafinil? Who do you think is actually going to be running things in a Biden administration? Again, I don't even know why I am letting you drag me into a political discussion here, because you're clearly not arguing in good faith. You are equating hollow, woke neoliberalism--of the sort espoused by Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden--with "leftism". If that's what you seriously consider leftism, it's just more proof that Friedman shifted the Overton Window wayyy right, and we're only just now starting to drag it back leftward.

									Wow, you had to bring up a poll that is decades old and at a time where we didn't have much empirical evidence of the subject and only theory. The thing about MW is that theory supports it being harmful while empirical evidence supports it. If you bring up recent polls, economists are overwhelmingly for a minimum wage in light of new evidence. Doesn't sound like something Friedman would support does it? This is a good example of evidence being more important than ideology in mainstream economics.

How can you twist what I said regarding modern day academics not "overwhelmingly leaning to Friedman's laissez faire capitalism" and then say that I think Friedman didn't have much of an impact on politics or governance? This is a complete misinterpretation of what I said, even if Friedman influenced governance, that has absolutely nothing to do with what modern academics think of him.

				Yeah, MMT proponents often prescribe policies, but we should separate that from the MMT framework. You can reach so many different policy proposals from MMT. There are some things about MMT that confuse me/disagree with like as you said "Government produces tax burden by producing money". I think MMT's biggest value add to economics is its explanation of finance, eg. dealer markets, liquidity, "moneyness" of instruments, etc. The base of knowledge that MMT builds this framework on is the same as notes that major banks put out. For example, this [series of articles](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7ihHS2AN-Vvd1) from Credit Suisse.

					> There are some things about MMT that confuse me/disagree with like as you said "Government produces tax burden by producing money".
					
					It‚Äôs just neo-chartalism. The idea is that governments can print money to finance spending as long as they also create sufficient demand for that money through adequate and well-inforced taxation. Moreover, inflation will still occur if the money supply grows faster than the economy.

					* üü• **[deleted]** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2020-09-15 17:08:06)_

						So my issue with that statement is that only wealth taxes can create a real demand for money. Ie., you have to pay taxes on an asset that may or may not be producing an income, so you need to find currency to pay the taxes. Some MMT people like Randall Wray don't specify this, so I don't see how me paying taxes on my restaurant bill creates demand for money. Isn't that just part of the cost of eating out? I think there's a lot of nuance to this statement that I haven't found good literature on from MMT people.

						* üü´ **[UrbanIsACommunist](https://www.reddit.com/user/UrbanIsACommunist)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2020-09-15 17:41:22)_

							I agree it‚Äôs a simple sounding explanation that leaves a lot unanswered. My understanding is that the ‚Äútaxation generates demand‚Äù hypothesis provides an explanation for the definition and origin of money that is centered on government (as opposed to alternative definitions like means of exchange and store of value, which also have major theoretical problems). This isn‚Äôt exactly a literal historical explanation (although in some cases it may very well be), but more of a theoretical, philosophical one.
							
							You are correct in pointing out that things like consumption taxes or income taxes cannot create demand for money by themselves, since they are taxes *on money itself*. Historically though, these types of taxes are much less common than things like wealth taxes, land taxes, commodity taxes, tariffs, etc. In fact, income taxes and consumption taxes don‚Äôt usually appear until the currency in question is already well established and in widespread use. Whereas there are lots of examples of fiat currencies that were created alongside taxes imposed on exogenous resources.
							
							It gets very complicated though, because monetary systems are self-reinforcing. When you‚Äôre talking about the largest economy in the history of the world, there are obviously a lot of factors in play. I don‚Äôt share Randall Wray‚Äôs view that fiscal policy is the main driver of inflation, but I do think it plays a role. The chartalist view helps to explain why e.g. the 2017 tax cut stimulated the economy, without resorting to supply side dogma. It also suggests Obama‚Äôs tax policy may have been a big factor in the slow recovery from 2008. Tax cuts stimulate the economy in large part because they increase the money supply, whereas tax hikes decrease it.
							
							Now I do also certainly think monetary policy plays a huge role in determining inflation and the size of the money supply, but I like the chartalist view because it doesn‚Äôt lead to the conclusion that the only way to stimulate growth or impact inflation is to double down on Reagan era policy tools. It also rejects the gold standard and is a nice rebuttal to the Peter Schiff goldbugs who insist that sound money can‚Äôt be created out of nothing‚Äîbut in contrast to a lot of orthodox economists, it doesn‚Äôt require that we relegate all power concerning money to the Central Bank.

							* ‚¨õÔ∏è **[deleted]** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2020-09-15 18:20:22)_

								>It gets very complicated though, because monetary systems are self-reinforcing. 
								
								Reflexivity is an overlooked phenomenon in the economy. I can't remember specifically Wray's view on fiscal policy and inflation, but what I gather from MMT in general is that the money supply is a very fluid thing. You have things like high powered money which is money to the layperson, treasuries, but you also have things that become more and more money-like in booms through reflexivity like constant NAV MMMF, ABS, repo. Through balance sheet effects, these create inflation, and when they collapse during liquidity crises, they are disinflationary (remember the hot mess that was the [Reserve Primary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Primary_Fund) in 2008?). 
								
								This is where I think the type of tax cuts are important in determining the inflationary impact of fiscal policy. From what I've seen, there were no meaningful changes in growth (GDP, investment, unemployment) from the 2017 tax cuts, but of course, the correct comparison is the counterfactual (ie., what would have happened if there was no tax cut). I think they were not inflationary because they increased corporate earnings and cash pools, so they increased asset prices, but didn't create a commensurate increase in demand (so not enough tax cuts for poorer people who have a higher marginal propensity to consume). I would say the same thing about Obama's fiscal policy; there wasn't enough aggregate demand added to the economy.

						right off the bat, "governments ... are financially unconstrained" seems like a bad take, since it also says MMT says governments are constrained by inflation.
						
						I see that a job guarantee program is shown there. I do not see how that related to debt.
						
						Another sentence that seemed unnecessarily adversarial:
						
						> MMT‚Äôs main macroeconomic claim to fame rests on its declaration regarding government‚Äôs ability to finance spending without recourse to taxation by issuing money. In fact, government‚Äôs ability to create money to finance spending has long been widely recognized by all economists, who have also long recognized that ability gives government considerable extra financial and policy space.
						
						In any other field, if two theories agree on something, that is good because it means they could both be correct.
						
						> As regards injecting state money to pay taxes, MMT is strictly wrong with its claim that the public cannot pay taxes until government has first spent. In fact, the central bank is the source of such money
						
						I think MMT views the central bank and the government as the same thing?
						
						Overall this feels more like an attack piece than a critical analysis of a scientific theory (even one the writer believes is incorrect).......

				I guess my question was a little rhetorical. I was suggesting that especially in the U.S. there seem to be many popular  theories that aren't based on much mathematical modeling, but more on desired outcomes. 
				
				Thomas Piketty is a very prominent critic of the the theory-first approach that has been so prevalent in the U.S.  so that kind of agrees with what you're saying.
				
				Piketty im fact argues for an evidence-first approach. So, don't we have  that evidence already?  I'm referring to QE, Quantitative Easing due to the great recession, which was essentially derived by printing new money. doesn't this fit the description of MMT? We haven't really seen any negative outcomes from that, have we? Its actually being hailed as a major life saver to the U.S. economy as far I can tell. But it was mostly banks and corporations that were in distress and got bailed out. Now it seems though that everyone else, small biz and individuals, are in distress and need bailing out. So can we expect the same  positive outcomes from printing new money to save small biz and individuals? Evidence says yes!
				
				We simply want more of the new money to go to real humans instead of fictitious humans, i.e corporations.

					QE is not MMT--it is not even remotely close to the ideas to suggested by Kelton, Mosler, and other MMT types.
					
					> But it was mostly banks and corporations that were in distress and got bailed out. 
					
					Not true. The assets were purchased from banks, but the point of QE was to increase liquidity and lower long-term interest rates, which helped just about everyone in one way or another.
					
					> So can we expect the same positive outcomes from printing new money to save small biz and individuals? Evidence says yes! 
					
					Evidence is extremely unclear because this isn't a policy, it's a goal. Are you suggesting helicopter money [similar to what Bernanke has discussed](https://www.brookings.ed[u/blog](https://www.reddit.com/user/blog)/ben-bernanke/2016/04/11/what-tools-does-the-fed-have-left-part-3-helicopter-money/)? That will likely go okay, but we have very limited evidence on use from a modern, developed country and the central bank likely has many other policies they would prefer to use first to accomplish the same ends.
					
					Are you talking about eliminating central bank independence and allowing politicians to just print money as they see fit, as most prominent MMT proponents are suggesting? In that case, evidence says this will land somewhere between okay and catastrophic.

			>This is not the case, as the Fed decides (or at least strongly influences) the interest rate. The primary dealers who first purchase securities can signal they want higher interest rates, but the Fed can manage lower rates if it wants to. Deficits cannot force interest rates to increase.
			
			This is simply not true. The Fed cannot and does not set interest rates at whatever level it wants. The Fed's policy rate is determined by external shocks that are almost always out of its control. [Markets set interest rates first, and the Fed merely accommodates those rates later](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/g4pnxy/z/fo8iu5u). What the Fed *can* control is inflation and the money supply. 
			
			Here's one way to think about it. Imagine you're a pilot flying a passenger airplane. These days you might not have to do much after take off. Set a course and the computer will do most of the work. Imagine that there's unexpected wind that pushes the plane off target and onto the wrong trajectory. But the computer will be able to adjust the plane for you in all likelihood.
			
			In what sense does the pilot control the direction of the plane here? *Even if the plane had no computer*, manually steering the plane back on target isn't something you choose to do exogenously! It was something you were *forced* to do because of factors that were completely outside of your control (the unexpected wind). You wouldn't have done that had the wind not pushed you off target. The thing you actually do control is the destination of your flight.

			Yes, but Treasury bills still have a risk premium built into them. Right now, that premium is very small because investors regard them as almost the safest asset available, but if we were to eliminate central bank independence, abandon our inflation target, and allow politicians to print money freely...well, that situation could quickly change.
			
			> MMTers are very upfront that a their framework only applies to countries that have have monetary sovereignty. 
			
			Sure, but lending in your currency becomes more and more difficult when your inflation rate is high/volatile and you don't have a credible central bank guaranteeing investors won't see their value lost to inflation. I'm sure Venezuela would love to borrow in their own currency if lenders would be naive. But at some point, you're going to find investors very reluctant to lend in your currency.
			
			Even in the US, though they borrow in their own currency, much of their debt is inflation-indexed, which presents difficulties on its own.

				Why would the situation change? Are you saying that demand for US treasuries will evaporate given the government makes adjustments to how it exercises monetary and fiscal policy? If the government can never be insolvent (which is something MMT points out), they'll continue to be in high demand. You see unconventional monetary policy being implemented around the world, but the demand for government bonds stays strong.

					> Are you saying that demand for US treasuries will evaporate given the government makes adjustments to how it exercises monetary and fiscal policy? 
					
					Evaporate? No. Greatly change? Given the exact changes MMT proponents wish to make, yes.
					
					It would be extremely naive to say that since US government bonds are considered safe assets *under current conditions*, they will always continue to be considered safe assets in the future, even if we make massive changes to our monetary system. (I'll explain more at the end, since I think this is worth expanding on)
					
					> If the government can never be insolvent (which is something MMT points out)
					
					Technically true, given a few assumptions, a government could at least have the *option* of avoiding default.
					
					> they'll continue to be in high demand 
					
					Not true. Investors aren't solely worried about physical default risk. If the government issues large amounts of money to cover their debt obligations (causing inflation in the process), then that is a risk as well. In an extreme scenario, this inflation could erode most of the real value of their bonds. At that point, this result looks little different from a default to them.
					
					Now, I'll come back to the interest rates on Treasuries. We can see in the literature that Treasuries *do* in fact have an inflation risk premium on them. There have been plenty of studies that looked at this, [such as this one](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2008.01332.x). Unsurprisingly, the premium is higher in regimes with higher/more volatile inflation.
					
					We can even take some lessons from the past of the US (when the central bank lacked the credibility it has today, and inflation was significantly higher) to see this holds true (per [Buraschi &amp; Jiltsov 2005](https://doi-org.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/10.1016/j.jfineco.2004.07.003)). The inflation premium steadily rose starting in the 1960's, eventually hitting it's peak around 1979-1983. On a 10 year security, the premium reached 1.4% by their estimates. Gradually, it fell from there as inflation declined and stabilized. [More recent estimates](https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2012/201206/201206pap.pdf) have the premium very low in the past couple decades. This is a testament to a credible, independent central bank and inflation targeting reducing concern around volatile inflation.
					
					Now if you were to remove all those safe-guards that have been so successful, it would be pretty ridiculous to suggest that treasuries will simply continue to benefit from their existence. 
					
					> You see unconventional monetary policy being implemented around the world, but the demand for government bonds stays strong. 
					
					Not really relevant, since the policies advocated by MMT haven't been used in any modern advanced economy. If you're referring to QE--well, this should be obvious, the whole *point* of QE was to push down long-term interest rates.

							Sure, the government could just not issue bonds. All Kelton's saying is that they can just directly issue money money instead--but you really can't do much of that, or you'll find inflation is sky-rocketing (which is a massive issue on its own). So sure, you escaped issues with debt and replaced them with issues of inflation.
							
							Bonds are useful because they give another option to the government if they want to spends funds but don't want to raise taxes. A bond-financed deficit is far less inflationary than a money-financed deficit.

										Maybe I'm being daft here, but I'd love a sanity check on this logic :P
										
										A federal government that issues it's own currency (like the US or Australia for example) has a fiscal deficit by definition when it spends more money than it taxes away. This becomes a private sector surplus of funds adding to the supply of money.
										
										Now, what traditionally follows from this is that the government will issue bonds to the private sector equal to the value of the deficit, right? My understanding is that bonds are nothing more than an obligation to pay an amount of currency, at a point in time, with some interest rate. To me, bonds seem like a form of interest-bearing currency here. 
										
										So, you can see that the government has issued more currency as a result of the deficit spending, but then issued more currency again with the issue of the bonds.
										
										Both the issuing of the bonds and the deficit spending appear to be a net gain to the supply of money. But maybe I'm missing something obvious here.

								Why would not issuing debt make inflation skyrocket? Is that because people think it would? That's a silly reason to think it would. 
								
								If there's a recession, "printing" an amount of money you would have deficit spent would likely have a similar result except you wouldn't have the interest earning channel. I don't see why that would be an issue.

	The latest iteration of my MMT pasta:

	 Economics is science, and part of the scientific method is the generation of testable and falsifiable hypotheses. [Here are a ton of different examples of that in macro](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/9kulc8/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/e72l0o7/). I have yet to see a single testable hypothesis or a formal model articulated by an MMTer. I feel that this puts MMT safely in the realm of psuedoscience, but its at least possible to do some work for the MMTers.

	I think the most important part of MMT is about the uselessness of monetary policy. More specifically, they argue that [the IS curve is vertical](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/bva1ge/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/epvdasv/). This is important. MMT does not just say that fiscal policy is useful. Basically anyone can tell you that fiscal policy is useful. MMT also requires that monetary policy be useless. 

	The obvious problem here is that monetary policy clearly is useful. [The IS curve is absolutely not vertical](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/b9ktk9/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/ek8sd9q/). The MMT line of argument typically goes "the money supply is endogenous", that is, money is determined by factors outside the control of the Federal Reserve. Therefore the Fed has very little influence over inflation and real output stabilization. 

	They argue instead that the Fed only controls interest rates. Rhetorically speaking this is useful for MMTers because it makes it seem like crowding out - which is the usual argument against very high deficits - is a policy choice rather than something that is inevitable. But I maintain that money and/or inflation are only endogenous over [periods of time shorter than six weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/5fg1q4/re_boe_paper/). Over longer periods of time central banks do not control interest rates. 

	If you'd like a more empirically driven discussion, here's [Inty explaining why MMT might seem plausible](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/410fg7/badeconomics_discussion_thread_15_january_2016/cyz9ffa/?context=1) (if this is too hard to understand I think [this Rowe post](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2011/04/reverse-engineering-the-mmt-model.html) does a good job at communicating basically the same idea). And [here's why that view is wrong](https://np.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/420vzw/badeconomics_discussion_thread_21_january_2016/cz6w2bb/).

	Now for more accessible reading outside of reddit, here are some very smart people that I respect dunking on MMT: 

	-  [Krugman on MMT's Calvinball problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/opinion/running-on-mmt-wonkish.html).

	- [Noah Smith analyzing an MMT paper that invokes genocide and colonialism](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2019/03/examining-mmt-model-in-detail.html).

	- [Bruenig on Modern Taxation Theory](https://medium.com/@MattBruenig/modern-taxation-theory-2fd56d30c7b).

	- [Rowe on how people cannot and do not 'spend money'](https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2014/06/repeat-after-me-people-cannot-and-do-not-spend-money.html).

	- [Sumner on MMT as a guide to policy](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/sumner_and_horan_-_policy_brief_-_how_reliable_is_modern_monetary_theory_as_a_guide_to_policy_-_v1.pdf).

	- [DeLong on where MMT goes wrong](https://www.bradford-delong.com/2019/01/what-is-modern-monetary-theory.html).

	- [Mankiw reviewing the only MMT textbook in existence](https://scholar.harvard.ed[u/files](https://www.reddit.com/user/files)/mankiw/files/skeptics_guide_to_modern_monetary_theory.pdf).

	- [Cochrane reviewing *The Deficit Myth*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-deficit-myth-review-years-of-magical-thinking-11591396579).

	You'll notice here that takes on the plausibility of MMT are completely orthogonal to the left-right political spectrum. Of this sample, Krugman, Smith, Bruenig, and DeLong are on the left while Rowe, Mankiw, Sumner, and Cochrane are more right-leaning. Really the more relevant axis to look at is "people you should take seriously vs people you should not take seriously." Generally speaking the people cited here are on the former side of the spectrum and I frankly can't say the same for MMTers.

		" have yet to see a single testable hypothesis or a formal model articulated by an MMTer."
		
		Here's one. 
		
		Get the central bank to discount all spare labour at $15 per hour. If the mainstream beliefs are true and the unelected people running things at the central bank can set an interest rate that governs the economy then there will end up being no takers (perhaps after an initial adjustment flurry). 
		
		MMT would say that the involuntarily unemployed will turn up along with all those doing substandard jobs until market competition corrected the products and services on offers so that they no longer rely upon the systemic underpricing of labour. Since at that point you could wind the competition in the economy up to 11 (including allowing banks to go bust since you're no longer relying upon debt injection) that would end up with more people employed in the private sector overall than mainstream theory can permit. (MMT would expect wait unemployment of about 2% at the cycle peak). It would autostabilise the economy both temporarily and spatially and lead to much higher output. But there will always be takers because of the way the monetary system works. 
		
		In MMT, money is endogenous and that trying to control an economy with interest rates doesn't work. As the test above would demonstrate clearly. 
		
		What the MMT view shows is that there tends to be a dynamic net drain to private sector savings all the time within a currency area. Those savings end up being inert, and similar in effect to taxation economically. For me this is key finding of MMT. 
		
		The net savings have to be offset in some way. The left wants to confiscate them. The right tries to hide them by pushing more private debt, which ends up pushing on a string. MMT says just accommodate them with Transition Jobs.
		
		The Transition Job system replaces inflation targeting via manually set base rates as the stabilisation function within a currency area. 
		
		Therefore MMT locks the base interest rate at zero and just allow the banking system to float to whatever extent it feels like this week. You stop intervening in the money market and trying to suppress asset prices.  For the most part just let the market go where it will. The side effect is that it ensures mortgage rates remain low permanently. And that most mainstream analysis about the effect of interest rates and the power of central banks can be discarded like alchemy - and for much the same reason. 
		
		You then set taxation policy sufficiently tight so that there will always be somebody going to the central bank to sell their labour in every physical location in your currency area. But no tighter than that. You want the employment buffer to be as small as possible so the private sector can work its magic, but not so small that the [disciplining effect](https://new-wayland.com/blog/how-the-jg-controls-inflation/) doesn't work. 
		
		In MMT the only thing extra the public sector has to spend is the unemployed - since that is the only resource without an alternative bid. If the public sector wants to use \*anything\* else it has to release it first. Taxation takes on a different hue in the MMT view since it is about releasing resources, not raising funds.
		
		If you hear anybody appealing to MMT to support their latest public sector spending spree, then ask them where the physical resources are coming from, and what those resources are doing now that they won't be doing when government uses them. The point about needing to release resources is often skated over, and needs to be challenged. MMT is very clear on the issue. If you want roofers to put up solar panels you need to tax those buying roofers (directly or indirectly) so they don't buy as many. Or explain where the new roofers, doctors, nurses, teachers, etc. are coming from. And no "training" isn't good enough because where are the trainers coming from...
		
		On the other side if you're pushing the idea of raising taxes because certain numbers don't equal other numbers and some numbers are just big, then you are on a fool's errand that is groundless and harmful to the economy. Government Bonds are a store of taxation. When whoever is saving them decides to spend them, the necessary taxation will be released at that time. 
		
		MMT shows that the notion of a public sector \*financing\* constraint has no basis in reality within a modern money economy with a floating rate currency. Instead the public sector is only constrained by what is available for sale in its currency and whether that is worth buying at the price quoted. Whether the public sector should get involved in buying resources is a political matter, but those politics must address where the resources are coming from \*and\* what the maximum price is the public sector should pay.
		
		If you listen to or read the works of Warren Mosler you'll find that he uses a phrase quite often: "We are grossly overtaxed for the size of government we have, as evidenced by the unemployment queue and the output gap". That's the core issue flagged up by the MMT analysis.

				Given MMT rejects axiomatic deductive constructs as not having an export licence to the real world, why would that ever happen? The models have no basis in reality - as evidenced by the unemployment queue, the output gap, interest rates, and inflation. That's all the real world proof required that the entire methodological approach is a dead end. 
				
				I've given you are *real world* test of your beliefs on the actual institutions. Are you up for it or not? If not, why not? 
				
				Do you not agree with the NAIRU concept? Are you not prepared to defend the unemployment buffer? 
				
				"Alright cool so we know that MMT is wrong"
				
				The level of unemployment says otherwise. And ultimately that is all that matters. Millions of people without work that want it, all of whom have votes. Millions of people in precarious jobs that don't need to be in that position, all of whom have votes. Large levels of private debt that is unnecessary, all with people who have votes. This is why MMT is gaining traction amongst real people - because they can see the damage belief in incorrect mathematical models is wreaking in their communities. 
				
				Damage the MMT viewpoint says is unnecessary and costly to the well being of the population and the planet. 
				
				The economy is there to serve the people, not the other way around. So the people will simply pick something that benefits them directly. 
				
				The paradigm is shifting. Might be time to engage with it rather more pro-actively.

								It shows there is no One True Interest Rate that rules them all. 
								
								Instead everything has its 'own' rate of interest - as Keynes explained. 
								
								The 'own' rate for government is zero. All the other interest rates are market determined from that.

						Do you agree with the NAIRU concept and are you prepared to defend the ex-ante predictions of it by the central bank to pre-emptively counter inflationary pressure? Are you prepared to defend the measures of inflation in the CPI? Why is that particular basket of goods more defensible as a construct than, say, the one prior to 1980 that included housing prices? The macro models aren't taking into account the institutional difficulties of measuring unemployment as it is relevant to the modeling as well as the CPI's basket as it is relevant to inflation, not to mention market governance, the discretionary nominal fed funds rate.

							>Do you agree with the NAIRU concept
							
							NAIRU is just an empirical phenomenon, it's like asking whether I agree with the concept of "3/2". Like yes? I don't know what it would mean to disagree with the concept of "3/2" you need to be more specific. 
							
							>and are you prepared to defend the ex-ante predictions of it by the central bank to pre-emptively counter inflationary pressure? 
							
							What central bank? My central bank is the Federal Reserve System and I've consistently criticized the Fed for hiking interest rates far too early. Same with the ECB. 
							
							>Are you prepared to defend the measures of inflation in the CPI? 
							
							No because non-chained price indexes are generally bad. 
							
							>Why is that particular basket of goods more defensible as a construct than, say, the one prior to 1980 that included housing prices?
							
							[CPI does include housing prices](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=yntp). I think you mean *house* prices, that's not the same thing as *housing* prices. The later is a consumption good, the former is a capital good. Clearly the *consumer* price index is more concerned with measuring one of those! If you want to measure both then you choose the wrong price index. Use something like the GDP deflator if you want to account for both.

								The issue is that they included all this "rational maximizer" or "Maximal rationalizer" in their analysis which really should be something that you only include after empirical behavioral economics. And there are plenty of behaviors in the human psyche in regard to whatever "praxeology" you're including in your analysis that are completely opposite what you'd expect. For instance, veblen goods. Why would I pay more for something just because it was a symbol of status to do so? Why would I have brand loyalty despite a price increase and a competitor with a lower price and no obvious change in the products of the respective firms?   
								
								
								Macro did not freeze in the 70s. The consensus changed deeply towards austrian and monetarist economics and many economists have slowly been distancing themselves from claims about the money supply management since its failure despite the policy world and the popular consciousness retaining a lot of that nonsense.

								there is no empirical evidence that you can measure it ex-ante.
								
								Determining a NAIRU based on the data the fed has received is completely insane. There are so many qualitative, demographic, sector-specific, and geographic factors at play that will determine if there actually is a specific  NAIRU a percent unemployment rate. There are many things like under-employment, various other tiers of employment that can act as buffers for inflation themselves, globalism, outsourcing, remote work, gig work that are going to make measuring any NAIRU in a currency area really difficult to achieve. What you're trying to measure is some amount of structural unemployment that can't be resolved before inflation. Why would that be so? Well, you've got some overarching supply chains with specific pools of potential workers in certain geographic areas, some of which are open to employment everywhere, and some of which are only open to labor in the most immediate geographic sense. If there are unemployed people in the vicinity of these supply chain firms, they can hire the labor cheaply without bidding up the price of already-employed labor to increase productivity without passing on higher unit costs to the economy at large. If you have a bunch of unemployed people in los angeles while supply chain company locales are at capacity and at full employment, inflation may commence without the unemployed people in los angeles able to get a job. Now if those people had been living near the supply chain firms that were passing on costs, the NAIRU would have been lower in that case. So it seems impossible to measure ex-ante solely from aggregated data. 
								
								And because they've been trying to measure it ex-ante and then raising rates to counter it pre-emptively, they've been achieving some self-fulfilling prophecy about NAIRU for the past 40 years. They've been systematically overshooting NAIRU estimates for no reason despite no inflation potential in sight. On top of that, even if there were credit expansions that created excess demand and employed people, income taxes soak up that excess cash anyways and its going to reduce demand multiplier effects. 
								
								  
								Why would anyone be attached to ex-ante NAIRU? Why would you be attached to it as a concept if you really couldn't predict it until you actually got inflation? Why would you use aggregates when the economy is so heterogenous?

		Lol have you read any PK theory at all? It doesn‚Äôt really sound like you have given you think that they are not aware that over longer time frames the central bank will adjust interest rates in response to changes in the money supply. There was a debate 30 years ago in the PK literature about exactly this point between horizontalists (think horizontal LM curve) and structuralists (upward sloping/step-shaped LM curve). It was resolved by making a distinction between the short and the long run similar to how you do here, which is ironic. A key difference though is that PK theorists reject long-run money neutrality due to hysterisis and path dependency. Some suggested reading seeing as you clearly haven‚Äôt done much on this topic:
		
		Fontana, (2003). Endogenous Money: An Analytical Approach. 
		
		That paper discusses this topic in detail.
		
		Also see: Fontana et al., (2020). Monetary economics after the global financial crisis: what has happened to the endogenous money theory? 
		
		As this goes over some key points wrt PK theory of endogenous money, MMT and how it relates to the mainstream.
		
		Also seeing as you keep (incorrectly) saying MMTers don‚Äôt have a model, there is a simple model with endogenous money in Chapter 8 of Fontana and Setterfield, (2009). Macroeconomic Theory and Macroeconomic Pedagogy. This model is proposed as a direct alternative to the NNS three equation model which is discussed and critiqued in the earlier part of the book, so it should be good introductory reading for you lol
		
		Also there is a budding literature of Stock-Flow Consistent models, including Agent-Based SFC models (e.g. Caiani et al., 2016), that could broadly be considered compatible with MMT, I.e. they take endogenous money seriously, are demand driven, generally share similar views on the nature of money, though most of these authors would simply identify as heterodox/post-Keynesian rather than MMTers, and in fact would probably have some criticisms of MMT. Still though, to say that there is no formal model that could be developed that describes an MMT world is to say that you aren‚Äôt familiar with the literature.

			Lol did you read these three [MMTers talking about vertical IS curves](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/bva1ge/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/epvdasv/)? You would if you actually read my comment. Please tell me more about how MMTers don't understand their own theories.
			
			Anyway, damn near everything is endogenous, including money, which you would know if you read my comment. Thats just standard macro, it's been like that for decades. Do not put words in my mouth, engage in good faith or else there's no reason for you to be here. Every time the MMT subreddit brigades this post you guys consistently ignore the actual substance of the discussion and are more interesting in whining about the fact that I'm demanding a model. Id much rather talk about the efficacy of monetary policy wrt economic stabilization. 
			
			The fact remains that post Keynesianism is not a synonym for MMT if you want to change the subject that's fine, but op was asking about MMT which absolutely does not have a model with testable hypotheses that are competitive with standard macro.

			* üü¶ **[Naturalz](https://www.reddit.com/user/Naturalz)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 3 _(2020-12-05 19:13:46)_

				First off, none of them mention IS curves, so you have to assume that they are talking in terms of IS curves for your comment to make any sense, which is a plausible reading of those statements but also not the only one. The point they seem to be making is that monetary policy is not very effective, at least there may be countervailing tendencies to the traditional monetary policy transmission mechanism, and Wray's point seems to be more about the direction of causality of monetary policy i.e. it's inherently reactive and not very effective at controlling demand.
				
				But honestly, I'm not interested in defending some view that monetary policy is ineffective, however this is not the core of MMT, and it being false would not render MMT falsified. Your whole point about this being the most important part of MMT is just flat out wrong. Monetary policy is not and never has been the focus of MMT. It has always been at its core a neo-chartalist view of money, with a post-Keynesian view of banking i.e. endogenous money. The main differences between it and general PK theory come down to policy proposals like a job guarantee, so there is a lot more common theoretical ground between PK theory and MMT than you seem to be suggesting, so much so that many PK models (particularly SFC models which emphasise accounting constraints on macroeconomies) can be said to accurately represent the core of MMT. The point about the efficacy of monetary policy is auxiliary at best, the view of money and fiscal policy espoused by MMTers is certainly not contingent on it.
				
				Also, the idea that MMT doesn't have a testable set of hypothesis is false, they have a coherent description of the monetary system with several testable hypotheses, it's just that they are pretty much universally accepted by economists so most people don't really focus on them. It is the conclusions that they draw from this view of the monetary system that differs from mainstream economics.
				
				>Anyway, damn near everything is endogenous, including money, which you would know if you read my comment. Thats just standard macro, it's been like that for decades. Do not put words in my mouth, engage in good faith or else there's no reason for you to be here.
				
				It is hard to engage in good faith with someone who does not seem to be genuinely interested in understanding how the mainstream view of 'endogenous money' differs quite substantially from the one espouse by PKs. In my opinion, you seem more interested in poo-pooing MMTers and dismissing it as crankery/badecon than actually engaging with it. Again I would refer you to Fontana et al., (2020). Monetary economics after the global financial crisis: what has happened to the endogenous money theory?
				
				There is a detailed discussion in there about why this statement
				
				>everything is endogenous, including money, which you would know if you read my comment. Thats just standard macro, it's been like that for decades.
				
				is false...
				
				From the paper:
				
				>"In short, for all progress made in rejecting some of its most extreme versions of the exogenous money view and its policy implications, mainstream theorists and policymakers consider the endogeneity of the money supply as either a mere historical accident or an empirical expedient, a residual in a set of formal equations. They have not embraced the EMT."
				
				>"However, while both the endogeneity of money and the use of interest rates as the key monetary policy tool have been long recognised by most central bankers and practitioners mainstream scholars have found it hard to reject the main principles of the exogenous money view. In addition, although current mainstream macroeconomic models define money as an endogenous variable, the dynamic process of creation, circulation and destruction of money is usually neglected. The point is that the endogenous creation of bank loans and monetary reserves is still regarded by many mainstream economists and central bankers as a mere empirical or transitory historical circumstance, not a key feature of capitalist economies to be properly explained by a logically consistent theory."
				
				[Also see this from the same paper on different views of money.](https://imgur.com/a/pTLBbQp)
				
				There is a good discussion in a BoE paper (not the usual one that MMTers link don't worry) on why EMT matters here also:  Jakab and Kumhof, (2015). Banks are not intermediaries of loanable funds ‚Äì and why this matters

						> Saying monetary policy is ineffective is a massive claim and it's what makes their claims about fiscal policy work.
						
						False. Their claims about fiscal policy are not contingent on the efficacy of monetary policy. It doesn't matter if monetary policy can stimulate demand for the claim that monetarily sovereign governments can't go involuntarily bankrupt, and that governments can and should run fiscal deficits most of the time.  
						
						>If monetary policy can effect output then monetary offset destroys the rest of MMT.
						
						What do you mean exactly? That the monetary authority will raise rates in response to a fiscal expansion, thereby reducing aggregate demand back to where it was before?  Wouldn't that be assuming fiscal policy is never effective? But I know that isn't your position.
						
						The MMT position is essentially that investment is demand-determined and generally relatively insensitive changes in the interest rate. This is perfectly consistent with advocating for fiscal policy, and doesn't really have much to do with the neo-chartalist view of money. 
						
						>If you're not interested in discussing the biggest issue with MMT then I'll go ahead and just ban you for breaking site wide brigading rules.
						
						I'm interested in hearing why MMT is wrong, but the fact that some MMTers have said some controversial things about monetary policy doesn't prove that fact. Ban me if you want, I'm not that bothered, especially if you're so interested in gatekeeping this place from any form of dissent.
						
						>A horizontal money supply curve is endogenous money. That's what I said. 
						
						Again, you're demonstrating an inability to engage with the material here. The PK EMT is not simply that "the LM curve is horizontal"... did you even look at the table? It says it right there that MMTers view the LM curve as step-shaped, so clearly there is more to it than that. And obviously you didn't read the paper which addresses the differences between the mainstream view of endogenous money and the PK view.
						
						>Once again, I'm not talking about PKs I'm talking about MMT. Do not shift the goalposts.
						
						MMTers are post-Keynesians. It is basically just simplified post-Keyenesian macro with a job guarantee tacked on and some catchy slogans. That isn't shifting the goal posts. 
						
						The most important part of MMT *is its view of money*, which it inherits directly from post-Keynesian thought. This is the part that is competitive with standard macro: the theory of money. There are many more methodological and theoretical differences between PK thought and standard macro, but MMT does not focus on these.

							I mean exactly what I said. If monetary policy can do things it means crowding out applies and thus fiscal deficits impose real costs on the economy and mitigates fiscal multiplier effects.
							
							It doesn't *assume* fiscal stimulus isn't effective, rather that's a consequence of the theory in general equilibrium.

Drop the phrase "IS curve" if you want MMTers seem to have an issue with this wording. I'm talking about the empirical effect of exogenous rate changes on output

								>I mean exactly what I said. If monetary policy can do things it means crowding out applies and thus defical deficits impose real costs on the economy and mitigates fiscal multiplier effects.
								
								It does not follow from monetary policy effecting demand that crowding out exists. I'm genuinely curious how you square that circle.
								
								As far as I understand, MMTers would argue that crowding out is unlikely to occur (especially if you do not assume that we are at or near full employment/equilibrium) for a few reasons. One being that investment is financed by newly issued credit, i.e. it's not contingent on the level of savings or bonds, but on the demand for loans and the lending behaviour of banks. Another reason being that the usual targets of government spending usually are not resources that the private sector is competing with the government for (again assuming we are not at full employment).
								
								>It doesn't assume fiscal stimulus isn't effective, rather that's a consequence of the theory in general equilibrium. I wouldn't say that applies in partial equilibrium but GE is what matters (this is all contingent on being above the ZLB as fotar as mainstream macro is concerned btw but I don't think this is a point of dispute).
								
								Okay well we're getting somewhere here, because I think the main point of disagreement between PK thought and mainstream thought is the rejection of the general equilibrium framework on both methodological and theoretical grounds. That is a rather big topic of discussion and I should be doing my econometrics coursework right now, but I can provide some relevant reading from a PK perspective if you wish. What i will say is this, I can restate your sentence from a PK perspective and it reads quite similarly:
								
								>It doesn't *assume* fiscal stimulus isn't effective, rather that's a consequence of the theory in general equilibrium
								
								>[MMT] doesn't *assume* fiscal stimulus [is] effective, rather that's a consequence of [a rejection of the theory of general equilibrium and embracing a neo-chartalist view of money with an endogenous money theory of banking.]
								
								This is what I mean by the conclusions you draw from relevant empirical facts about money. MMTers (and PKs more generally) would contend that the mainstream theory of money is not fully coherent, which is why they draw different conclusions about fiscal policy (and coincidentally financial regulation!).
								
								>Yes that's what a vertical IS curve means. Again this is inconsistent with fundamental facts about the real world. 
								
								Slow down, I said *insensitive* not *perfectly inelastic*. The IS curve (if we must use these terms, the relationship between interest and output may be highly non-linear and state-dependent) is *steep* not necessarily vertical. The point being that other factors like expected rates of return and investor confidence play a much larger role than any change in the interest rate could. 
								
								>I said endogenous money has been a standard part of mainstream macro for decades which is literally what your paper is saying as well! Horizontal LM is a form of endogenous money.
								
								Again, the point of that paper is that whilst the Horizontal LM curve is a form of endogenous money, the mainstream theoretical approach to this issue is to regard this as a simple empirical fact that doesn't take the theoretical implications of this insight seriously, which is why there is still differences between the PK EMT and the mainstream one. 
								
								>Not according to post-Keynesians.
								
								From the article:
								"MMT is a strand of the PK school"
								"MMT is a strand of Post-Keynesian..."
								
								But I'll address the points he makes anyway... He basically says that because they take influence from Abba Lerner, Knapp and Minsky, that they are no longer (really) PKers. There's a couple problems with this: 'post-Keynesian' was not coined until after most of Lerner's work, and indeed his work influences a lot of PK thinkers, so he could be labeled PK himself. Second, though Minsky resisted being labeled a PKer, he did so mainly out of desire for his theories to be accepted by the mainstream. His strand of thought can be traced through both Marx and Keynes, as does the thought of many other PK authors, and any sensible categorisation of economists into branches in the history of economic thought would put Minksy squarely in the PK branch (I mean he does have a whole book titled "John Maynard Keynes"), if only due to the amount of PK work that takes direct inspiration from his work. Wray himself was a student of Minsky. 
								
								Neo-chartalism is probably the most contentious positive aspect of MMT amongst PKs, but there is plenty of disagreement amongst PKs on many issues, so this doesn't mean MMTers aren't PKs. They surely are.

									> It does not follow from monetary policy effecting demand that crowding out exists. I'm genuinely curious how you square that circle.
									
									Say that fiscal policymakers want to increase inflation by running a fiscal deficit so they pass legislation to do so. The central bank, following its 2% inflation objective, must react in order to stay on target. They hike rates, thus preventing the fiscal deficit from increasing inflation.  
									
									>One being that investment is financed by newly issued credit, i.e. it's not contingent on the level of savings or bonds, but on the demand for loans and the lending behaviour of banks.
									
									Yes im aware. The argument is that somehow this implies interest rates dont impact the supply of loans (and I mean that in the economic sense, the mainstream arg it that decreases the quantity of loans banks want to make). This is fundamentally inconsistent with essential facts about the real world. 
									
									wrt GE, what do you mean by this exactly? Are you talking about a specific GE model like DSGE or something? Because I am using this term fairly loosely. I mean this in the sense that if you assume monetary offset doesnt happen, then fiscal stimulus would be effective.

										PKs don't assume that running a fiscal deficit implies an increase in inflation (and in fact the experience of Japan in the 90s and most of Europe for the last 10 years would seem to be congruent with this). We also don't assume that the central bank will hike rates as soon as there is a fiscal expansion, another fact that seems to be borne out by the evidence (it's a crazy COVID world isn't it).
										
										>The argument is that somehow this implies interest rates dont impact the supply of loans (and I mean that in the economic sense, the mainstream arg it that decreases the quantity of loans banks want to make).
										
										The argument is that the interest rate is not the most important or determining factor for the *demand* for loans, and that banks, who are in the business of making loans, will extend credit to those they deem credit-worthy, i.e. credit *supply* is demand determined; banks are price makers and quantity takers. Therefore interest rates will not have dramatic effects on investment as investment decisions take far more into account than simply the interest rate. In simple terms: businesses invest when they think they will be able to generate profit for a given level of interest, and the investment will be financed by the creation of deposits via a loan, given the bank deems the customer credit worthy. In this sense the amount of bank credit is demand-determined, and "the" interest rate is only one factor that determines the demand for investment. The relevant point is that if the fiscal expansion leads to increased growth, this may well *stimulate* the demand for credit to finance investment, i.e. *crowding in*.
										
										WRT to GE, my comments apply to both DSGE and the more loose concept of GE. PKs generally reject the notion that the economy has reliable self-adjusting mechanisms that bring it back to 'equilibrium', thus they reject things like that 'natural rate of output' etc. In the context of this discussion, we do not assume that the central bank will act so as to offset future inflation in response to a change in fiscal policy (or even that it necessarily *can* always control inflation, but that is an argument for a different day), so yes fiscal policy is effective, even when the economy isn't at the ZLB. The book (Fontana and Setterfield, 2009) I mentioned before is honestly well worth reading if you want a more detailed discussion of this. It will give you a much better understanding of the disagreements we are having here. Also Arestis (2007). *Is There a New Consensus in Macroeconomics?* contains a critical appraisal of the view you are defending, with contributions from both mainstream and heterodox economists. Philip Arestis is a well respected PKer from Cambridge, so you may want to try giving him a read.
										
										WRT to your last two points, I wouldn't necessarily interpret those results as the IS curve being 'highly elasctic'. Not to mention there is a decent amount of variation in the results depending on the methodology employed. Besides, the point still stands that the main determinants of investment (or consumption FWIW) decisions is not, generally speaking, the nominal interest rate.
										
										I didn't see the bit you edited out but I'll just assume it wasn't very nice lol
										
										Edit: Also see [Arestis and Sawyer, (2006). The Nature and Role of Monetary Policy When Money IS Endogenous.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5208600_The_Nature_and_Role_of_Monetary_Policy_When_Money_is_Endogenous). HIGHLY relevant to this discussion.

		>Economics is science, and part of the scientific method is the generation of testable and falsifiable hypotheses
		
		Economics involves subjective variables. This is on the level of expecting to predict what will happen to characters in a star wars movie based on their stats.  Sure you may find some interesting correlations, but nothing is fundamentally stopping you from completely rewriting the story.

			Give me an example. Look at any of the 55 papers in [the first comment I linked to](https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/9kulc8/the_fiat_discussion_sticky_come_shoot_the_shit/e72l0o7/) and show me what the "subjective" variable is, point to the equation.

			* üü¶ **[deleted]** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 1 _(2020-10-07 12:09:30)_

				I can't really download the papers.  But GDP is a subjective variable, inflation is a subjective variable, interest rates are a subjective variable, prices are a subjective variable. Even "real" wages are a subjective variable, because consumers can choose to buy different things with them.  If you measured quantitatively what consumers *actually* bought, and quantified each thing separately, that would be an objective variable.
				
				Life expectancy is an objective variable, oil consumption is an objective variable, the number of cars manufactured is an objective variable.
				
				It is fine to do research on subjective variables, but 1. claims are not falsifiable, because you can always replace the subjective layer and get different results. 2. Results can't be used for extrapolation, or creating general rules that apply to new situations.  You can use old results as a starting point, but all research with subjective variables has a short shelf life.
				
				Doing research on subjective variables is like doing a focus group.
				
				If mainstream economists were self aware, they would stop saying MMT is wrong, and start saying that they just don't care about the questions MMT is being applied toward analyzing.  They don't care to think critically about the current legal and political structure of money, and are fine just operating under the status quo.  They would say "MMT is unnecessary".
				
				There is no empirical evidence that 1+1 = 2. You have to be able to define counting first before you are able to do empirical tests.  MMT does not care about your statistical methodology, it cares about your definitions, and the way you try to impose an objective framework on subjective variables. You can't empirically prove a definition true or false.  You can only empirically show that a particular concept isn't relevant to a particular problem.  For example, if you stacked two 1 kg masses and that resulted in a 3kg mass, that wouldn't prove addition is wrong, it would show matter doesn't follow conservation laws.
				
				The mainstream framework is *prescriptive*, as much as it is *descriptive.* In other words, it finds the results it's looking for, because *it's telling people, investors, and institutions how they should respond to subjective variables.* The only thing these empirical results tell us is that incentives and opportunity are not currently sufficient to go against the weight of institutional power and conventional thinking.  In some situations, being right is powerful enough to get a benefit from going against the grain, in others, it isn't
				
				When you are investing, and you think a stock is overpriced, it becomes very hard to predict when that will manifest in the traded price.  If everyone believes the price is accurate, it can go on for a long time.  Indeed prices are subjective, so there is no inherent reason why it can't go on in perpetuity.  With subjective variables, you have to analyze the *subject:* the people institutions, organizations, etc, which are using the thing, and not the *object:* ie money and goods.  If you treat the variables as arising from the object alone, you are confused and wrong.  You cannot link inflation and unemployment objectively.  Any links involve the subjects: people and institutions interacting with each other in particular ways for particular ends.  If you don't integrate the ends of the people involved, you will not get extrapolative, general results, you only get a one time observation that can't reliably be applied to new scenarios.

					This comment demonstrates profound ignorance in how the process of science is done. GDP is defined in the National Income and Product Accounts. It has an objective meaning in the sense that it is exactly what we define it to mean. This is a massive problem with MMTers, they confuse economics with *accounting*. 
					
					GDP can be used as a measure of real output, which is often done in economics. PCE can be used as a measure of the price level, but so can CPI or the GDP deflator or whatever. These are all quantitative metrics for more abstract ideas yes that is part of science. Measuring life expectancy really isn't that different.
					
					> It is fine to do research on subjective variables, but 1. claims are not falsifiable, because you can always replace the subjective layer and get different results. 
					
					What do you mean its not falsifiable? This is called a "robustness check", econ papers do this all the time. If your results are sensitive to which price index you choose, that's a very bad sign and generally means the theory is weak. In other words, if your theory fails a robustness check it has essentially been falsified! If you don't bother to do robustness checks of some kind then I kinda doubt you'd be able to get published. 
					
					>2. Results can't be used for extrapolation, or creating general rules that apply to new situations. You can use old results as a starting point, but all research with subjective variables has a short shelf life.
					
					I don't get this. Replication is part of the scientific method, and many many many theories and empirical results get replicated in Macro very consistently. e.g: we can consistently show that the IS-curve is not vertical. That means "all research with subjective variables has a short shelf life" is simply unfounded unless you want to reject the scientific method all together! These results are reliable according to the scientific method.

					I mean economists don't say MMT is wrong precisely because its non-falsifiable. You might wanna reread my comment because it was one of the first points I made! Read literally any one of the 8 articles I cited from actual economists they all say this consistently - MMT is only concerned with non-falsifiable claims and is therefore fundamentally unscientific.

						> It has an objective meaning in the sense that it is exactly what we define it to mean
						
						No, it is an aggregate of subjective variables. Every price and exchange is an expression of subjective value, by definition.  With subjective activities, the subject(people) is just as important, or more, than the objects(money, goods and services). 
						
						I have said this before and I will say it again, being scientific in economics means properly contextualizing your assertions within other scientific domains, like biological evolution, natural history, etc. It does not mean imitating their methodologies for a problem where it makes no sense.
						
						Humans evolved from animals, and developed abilities to speak, communicate, organize societies, develop culture, etc. I'm afraid that being inside our culture makes you think that our culture's values and signalling have objective meaning.  All cultural activities are relative to the norms of that society.
						
						The marvel is that human cooperation exists at all.  Humans can cease to cooperate at any moment, for any reason. They can steal, lie, cheat, or simply ignore your expectations.  Supply and demand fails as a model, because it fails to recognize price as a negotiation for creating cooperation in place of conflict, it presents price as merely an economic calculation, and not a political one with respect to owning and controlling resources.
						
						Measuring economic variables, aside from the logistical aspect, ie the actual movement and transformation of resources, is no different from measuring what music people like.  You are trying to analyze waves on the surface of an ocean while pretending like the depths aren't there.  You do not have sufficient information to answer the question correctly, so any apparently meaningful results are either temporary regularities or coincidences.

				Imagine the economy is composed entirely of robots, and they use a special programming language to talk among themselves. Under this protocol, the language has certain effects on the robot's actions and the resulting activities they do.
				
				Now you push out an update to this protocol, so now the robots behave differently. You redefine the specification.  Any results from empirical tests from the old protocol, are now possibly irrelevant under the new protocol.
				
				Because economics studies human protocols, like finance and trade, and humans are constantly learning and adapting, you can't claim empirical results are valid, *unless you first describe what the protocols are and how they are defined*. This is the legal and institutional framework.  Even without new laws, replacing people and/or technology can mean the protocol works differently, and you can't extrapolate results.  Do not confuse the internal language used by a social network for the objective effects of the actions of that network.  C'mon, let's be honest and scientific here.

					> Because economics studies human protocols, like finance and trade, and humans are constantly learning and adapting, you can't claim empirical results are valid, unless you first describe what the protocols are and how they are defined.
					
					What you're describing is a model and MMTers famously do not have one. I gave you 55 examples of papers that empirically test models. 
					
					In particular I am pretty sure you're regurgitating a half baked version of the Lucas Critique I have no idea why you think economics hasn't already figured this out. The Lucas Critique does not imply science isn't possible, that's an incoherent reading of it. It means you need to have a different approach to model building than what was common among the old keynesians. 
					
					Is this difficult? Absolutely. No one said science was easy! That's not the same thing as claiming that science is impossible.

						>I am pretty sure you're regurgitating a half baked version of the Lucas Critique
						
						This is not the lucas critique, though it is related. It is differentiating signalling and protocols, which are subject to an interpretive framing, from objective measurements, which are physically measurable.  Money, interest, banking, etc, is not physically measurable, it is a protocol.  You cannot really claim to understand protocols without studying computer science and/or information and signalling theory, and perhaps control.  It's not that economists couldn't think of this, I'm sure plenty have, it's just that they would likely dismiss it as either irrelevant or intractable to try to analyze, and likely haven't delved into computer science or linguistics enough to understand how protocols are developed and can change.
						
						The lucas critique is related in that it recognizes that there is a subjective layer, ie historical policy changes, however, it fails to fully generalize this distinction and recognize that many economic variables have no physical interpretation, and should thus be treated differently methodologically from objective variables.
						
						Economists differentiate between "real" and "nominal" which is part of the distinction, but they fail to recognize that this distinction necessitates an entirely different methodological approach, and specifically, a failure to describe how nominal variables are created, either through robust definitions or social processes, like the legal system, means your analysis of those variables is always going to be missing information.
						
						Not only is methodological science in this domain difficult, it is also completely ineffective. It is on par with trying to use statistics to play chess through correlations, in place of algorithmic exploration, ie min-max trees.  Searching for statistical correlations in complex computational system is expensive, ineffective, and just bad.  You need emulation not statistics.
						
						Right now emulation with DSGEs and such, is like chess engines well before IBM's deep blue.  They could not hold a candle to human analysis. Given that the economy is much more combinatorically complex than chess or even go, this is not surprising.  Humans can integrate many forms of domain knowledge in their analyses which is especially relevant to economics.  The questions MMT is analyzing, like sovereign default, aren't complex, they are just very hard to map to a quantitative domain.   Inflation involves the intersection of the real economy and the "nominal economy", which is a collection of protocols underwhich we conduct finance and resource decisions.
						
						Do I think stats has its place? yes, in informing us about phenomena that are hard to observe otherwise, like public health, etc. But using stats for analysis of complex system is, as of right now, not up to par as of now with very basic human analysis, once you look at historical trends quantitatively.  There is no need for regressions, for many problems.
						
						Do I think those statistical studies have value? yes, but only if you make very strict and rigid assumptions, ie the lucas critique.

	Not able to answer the question; just looking for clarification on MMT

	I read up on it, and it seems like it is just a theory saying that Governments are spending too much time focusing on balancing the budget and should be more focused on other things

	Is this assumption correct?

		Possibly, though it's hard to tell what MMT really is (see other comments).  
		
		Also, when economists speak of theory, they usually mean carefully stated mathematical models and results derived from those models.  A "theory that we should do X", for any X, is not the kind of thing we're talking about, though you can use theory (i.e. mathematical modeling) and empirics (data analysis) to make the case that doing X has large benefits.  
		
		As far as I am aware, MMT has not been good about providing these models, or making it clear exactly what their theory is and how it departs from the mainstream literature.  By not doing those things, they don't really have a "theory" in the sense that the profession defines the term.  I am also not familiar with any good evidence that those departures, if they do clearly state them, are correct.

			That's because MMT is exactly not what you say it is. It is **not** advice for what we should do, it is a simple observation of reality. 
			
			The mistake people like you always make is you take the logical conclusions that *can* be derived from the logical observation that is MMT and think it backwards even though it's the other way round. 
			
			The way we all discovered MMT is because we felt there was something wrong with the way we think about monetary policy, not because we were in favor of more spending.
			
			What MMT simply says is that a sovereign currency issuer does not have to depend on lenders, neither does it have to have the necessary amount of taxes to pay for something (I hope it's clear why that is), if it wants money pumped into the economy or if it wants to pay off its debt, it simply does so by altering some digits in the system to the benefit of the lender's or the receiving bank account in the private sector. 
			
			**Which** leads us to the conclusion that we actually do not have to worry about the deficit, all we have to worry about getting the deficit just right so we have a grip on inflation. This doesn't mean "let's start spending like crazy because the deficit doesn't matter", it means "let's adjust the deficit according to the output gap needs". Is there an output gap? => Raise the deficit. Is the economy working at full capacity? => Do nothing. Is inflation too high? => reduce spending. It works both ways, not just in one direction. 
			
			And that last paragraph are only the logical consequences of the theory itself - which is that we should not be constrained by neither the absolute nor relative height of the deficit because we are the sole issuer of the currency and can pay off our debt at **any time**. Why does this not devalue our currency? Because as long as our private sector demands it, it has value and as long as it has value, it will not inflate.

		Very good response from /[u/ImperfComp](https://www.reddit.com/user/ImperfComp), but if I am to respond to the latter part of your question, Probably yes. 
		
		In the short run balancing budgets doesn't matter a whole lot and some smart people (Larry Summers) are advocating for governments to run up higher deficits over the next decade or so. In my opinion a lot of budget deficit arguments are driven by ideology, not economics. Like a conservative government will usually try and run a surplus cause that lines up with their ideology and vice versa.
		
		Most discussion about government debt and deficit is more political than economic.
