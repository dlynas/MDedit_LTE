## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rootstrikers&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

Rootstrikers was founded in April 2011. In November 2011, Rootstrikers, previously known as [Change Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_Congress "Change Congress") and Fix Congress First, became a project of United Republic, a non-partisan [501(c)(4) organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization "501(c) organization"). In September 2012, Rootstrikers reorganized under the umbrella of [Fund for the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_One "Issue One"), a [501(c)(3) organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization "501(c) organization") dedicated to challenging the influence of money in American politics. As of July 2013, Rootstrikers became a project of [Demand Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_Progress "Demand Progress"), an organization cofounded by [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz "Aaron Swartz"), an internet activist.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> The organization plans to use [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology") to help engage people.<sup id="cite_ref-tws2D18_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-tws2D18-8">[8]</a></sup>

The name "Rootstrikers" is based on a quote from the first chapter of [Henry David Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau "Henry David Thoreau")'s book _[Walden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden "Walden"):_<sup id="cite_ref-tws2D14_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-tws2D14-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Walden_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-Walden-9">[9]</a></sup> "_There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root_". In December 2011, Lawrence Lessig appeared on _[The Daily Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Show "The Daily Show")_<sup id="cite_ref-tws2D17_5-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-tws2D17-5">[5]</a></sup> starring [Jon Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stewart "Jon Stewart") and suggested that the public needs to strike at the root of money in politics; Stewart advised Lessig "You need a better term than _rootstriker_."<sup id="cite_ref-tws2D11_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-tws2D11-6">[6]</a></sup> Lessig credits the line quoted above from [Henry David Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau "Henry David Thoreau")'s book _[Walden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden "Walden")_ for inspiring the name.

## Positions\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rootstrikers&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Positions")\]

In his 2012 book _[One Way Forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Way_Forward "One Way Forward")_, Lessig proposes what he termed the _Anti-Corruption Pledge_. Lessig launched the Pledge as a project of Rootstrikers on February 24, 2012, on MSNBC's show _[Morning Joe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe "Morning Joe")_.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> The pledge is available for people to sign to show their support for the fight against corruption. The Pledge has four provisions:

-   publicly funded elections<sup id="cite_ref-tws2D15_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-tws2D15-11">[11]</a></sup>
-   political expenditures which are limited and transparent<sup id="cite_ref-tws2D15_11-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-tws2D15-11">[11]</a></sup>
-   ending the revolving door between [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") and [K Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States "Lobbying in the United States")
-   reaffirmation that when the Declaration of Independence spoke of entities "endowed by their Creator with unalienable Rights," it was speaking of natural persons only,<sup id="cite_ref-tws2D15_11-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-tws2D15-11">[11]</a></sup> and not corporations.

## Activities\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rootstrikers&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Activities")\]

Over the weekend of October 29, 2011, a coalition of Rootstrikers and the conservative [Tea Party Patriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_Patriots "Tea Party Patriots") held a "Conference on the Constitutional Convention" in hopes of generating support for the calling of a [national convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_to_propose_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution") to propose proposing amendments to the [U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Constitution "U.S. Constitution").<sup id="cite_ref-Conservative_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-Conservative-12">[12]</a></sup> Such a convention, also called an "Article V Convention", is one of two ways processes authorized by [Article Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution "Article Five of the United States Constitution") of the [United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution "United States Constitution") whereby the Constitution, the nation's frame of government, may be altered, and must be called by the [United States Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") upon the request of two-thirds (presently 34) of the [state legislatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States) "State legislature (United States)"). Amendments may also be proposed by Congress itself with a two-thirds [vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority "Supermajority") in both the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives") and the [Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate").<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Thirty-three amendments to the U.S. Constitution have been approved by Congress and sent to the states for [ratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification#Ratification_in_the_United_States_Constitution "Ratification"). (Twenty-seven of them have been ratified and are now part of the Constitution.) As of 2016 the convention process has never been used for proposing constitutional amendments.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

Rootstrikers is one of 15 organizations in the Money Out / Voters In coalition that sponsored "A 28th Amendment" conference at the [UCLA School of Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_School_of_Law "UCLA School of Law"), Saturday, November 17, 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> [Lawrence Lessig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig "Lawrence Lessig") was the keynote speaker. The agenda included presentations by other experts, including Greg Colvin, who provided a dozen questions that he thought should be answered for any proposed amendment on this issue.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> The conference web site also includes a comparison chart of 21 alternative amendments, 18 that have already been introduced in the US congress plus language proposed by Free Speech for People,<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootstrikers#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Greg Colvin, and [Move to Amend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_to_Amend "Move to Amend"). Of the proposed amendments, five were identified as primarily attempting to limit the constitutional rights of corporations; the other 16 were described as dealing more with campaign finance, though there is overlap. The conference ended with breakout sessions and a call to further action.
