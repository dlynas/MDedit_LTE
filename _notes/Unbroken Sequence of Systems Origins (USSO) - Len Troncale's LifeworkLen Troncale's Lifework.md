There are several different attempts at describing how entities have emerged at different times in nature, with different dynamics, and composed of different parts, but these are usually restricted to those entities WITHIN a domain or discipline, e.g. astronomy, cosmology, chemistry or biology where Miller and Urey received the Nobel Prize for their experiments on the Origins of Life. Essentially these are reductionist approaches to ORIGINS.

In our work, we use a rigorously transdisciplinary approach that describes each of these emergences of a new scalar level of entity (which are equivalent we say to distinct, empirically demonstrable hierarchical levels/see Hierarchy Theory research sub-button) as actually origins of new systems. Comparing them afterwards shows similarities we call the isomorphies. These isomorphic patterns, processes, and pathologies are the SP<sup>3</sup>T theory that we have devoted an entire new website to explaining. Go to:

We have found that describing these emergence phenomena have happened again and again from the Big Bang to modern civilization. It is as if Nature keeps evolving or emerging the SAME SYSTEM over and over, just at different scales, giving different components. We think this can be demonstrated as a law in Statistical Thermodynamics, or as a high probability event. We have organized these emergence events into a series of cycles of Integration (I) and consequence Diversification (D) described as an Unbroken Sequence of I/D Cycles since the Big Bang. They are unbroken because despite the popular, common concept that all living systems are separate from physical, and all conscious from biophysical, the USSO teaches they ALL are connected from the Big Bang to human societies and thoughts. We find that these cycles are  continuous such that we describe a UNBROKEN SEQUENCE OF SYSTEMS ORIGINS without any anthropocentric-based separations.

Dr. Troncale has presented this theory consistently from 1972 to the present in the following venues:

-   his first paper in systems in 1972 which was awarded the “best paper” for the Far West Region of ISGSR Conference that year. And several follow-on papers on it and its consequences, a Theory of Emergence at ISGSR and ISSS and ICCS and INCOSE/CSER Conferences.
-   Course at UCSD, Frontiers of Science, 138: Cosmic Evolution and Emergence. With many guest speakers including Nobel Laureates.
-   Courses nominally titled EVOLUTION (original catalogue #Bio 213), at least two times per year from 1972 to 2010 at his home institution of California State Polytechnic University (Cal Poly Pomona) where he was at one time Chair of the Biological Sciences Dept.
-   Two weeks of invited presentations at University of Alaska, Anchorage.

There were many other workers who researched specific transitions or emergences of new systems over these many decades (Nobel Laureate S. Miller (who gave a talk in Troncale’s UCSD course), Urey, Fox, Oparin, Morowitz, Chaisson, Kauffman, Bejan, etc.) but these workers did not encompass the entire spectrum from physical to sociological as in this current work.

Other workers have lately presented parts of this Unbroken Sequence as shown in these power points and the papers listed under Theory of Emergence sub-button:

-   Tyler Volk
-   David Christian and Big History
-   Tom Marzolf
-   David Rousseau
-   George Mobus
