"Do you believe that Israel is guilty of the crime of apartheid?
Because Israelis often say it's offensive and disrespectful to the South African
Jews struggled against apartheid to compare the Palestinians to that struggle.
So it'd be interesting to ask the South African government official,
what do you think about the apartheid analogy?
Well, I respond in this way, if I cannot travel on a particular form of transport
because of my next reality, what is that?
I could not travel on particular forms of transport in South Africa
because of my nationality. If I cannot own my land and be certain
that I have a freehold over it and can retain it in perpetuity for generations,
what is that but apartheid? If I have my land broken up into pockets which are supervised by
particular authorities and I need permits in order to enter into that land,
if I'm reserved in terms of movement to move within a particular corridor and have
barriers placed that indicate which part of that corridor I can walk in and as I proceed all
along it, I have to produce identity documents. If I can be arrested, detained without
charge, without bail, not knowing why I'm in a prison, what wrong I have done? What else
compares to this?"
