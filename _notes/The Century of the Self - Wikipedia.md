## Overview [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Century_of_the_Self&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Overview")

[Sigmund Freud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud"), the founder of [psychoanalysis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis "Psychoanalysis"), changed our perception of the mind and its workings. The documentary explores the various ways that governments, global organizations and corporations have used Freud's theories. Freud and his nephew [Edward Bernays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays "Edward Bernays"), who was the first to use psychological techniques in [public relations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations "Public relations"), are discussed in part one. His daughter [Anna Freud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Freud "Anna Freud"), a pioneer of child psychoanalysis, is mentioned in part two. [Wilhelm Reich](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich "Wilhelm Reich"), an opponent of Freud's theories, is discussed in part three.

> To many in politics and business, the triumph of the self is the ultimate expression of democracy, where power has finally moved to the people. Certainly, the people may feel they are in charge, but are they really? _The Century of the Self_ tells the untold and sometimes controversial story of the growth of the mass-consumer society. How was the all-consuming self created, by whom, and in whose interests?

BBC publicity.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

Along these lines, _The Century of the Self_ asks deeper questions about the roots and methods of [consumerism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism "Consumerism") and [commodification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodification "Commodification") and their implications. It also questions the modern way people see themselves, the attitudes to [fashion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion "Fashion"), and [superficiality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superficiality "Superficiality").

The business and political worlds use psychological techniques to read, create and fulfill the desires of the public, and to make their products and speeches as pleasing as possible to consumers and voters. Curtis questions the intentions and origins of this relatively new approach to engaging the public.

Where once the political process was about engaging people's rational, conscious minds, as well as facilitating their needs as a group, [Stuart Ewen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Ewen "Stuart Ewen"), a historian of public relations, argues that politicians now appeal to [primitive impulses](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instinct "Instinct") that have little bearing on issues outside the narrow self-interests of a consumer society.

The words of Paul Mazur, a leading [Wall Street](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street "Wall Street") banker working for [Lehman Brothers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers "Lehman Brothers") in 1927, are cited: "We must shift America from a needs- to a desires-culture. People must be trained to desire, to want new things, even before the old have been entirely consumed. \[...\] Man's desires must overshadow his needs."<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Century_of_the_Self#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

In part four the main subjects are [Philip Gould](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Gould "Philip Gould"), a political strategist, and [Matthew Freud](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Freud "Matthew Freud"), a PR consultant and the great-grandson of Sigmund Freud. In the 1990s, they were instrumental to bringing the [Democratic Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)") in the US and [New Labour](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Labour "New Labour") in the United Kingdom back into power through use of the [focus group](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group "Focus group"), originally invented by psychoanalysts employed by US corporations to allow consumers to express their feelings and needs, just as patients do in psychotherapy.

Curtis ends by saying that, "Although we feel we are free, in reality, we—like the politicians—have become the slaves of our own desires," and compares Britain and America to 'Democracity', an exhibit at the [1939 New York World's Fair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_New_York_World%27s_Fair "1939 New York World's Fair") created by Edward Bernays.
