## A list on some great subreddits for life improvement.

> I spend alot of time on reddit and I'm trying to make good use of it. I've already weeded through my subreddit subscriptions and I'm looking to replace them with some more productive options. Does any one want to give some suggestions on great subreddits for improving ones life.
