## META: An Historical Overview of 9/11, as the 20 Year Rule Enters 2021

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kocf1z/meta_an_historical_overview_of_911_as_the_20_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kocf1z/meta_an_historical_overview_of_911_as_the_20_year/)

> Hello everyone and welcome to 2021! As most readers are aware, we use a 20 Year Rule which rolls over every new year. Most years, the newly available topics are fairly mundane, but as we've been noting for some time, 2021 is different. Despite jokes to the contrary, we are *not* implementing the 21 Year Rule. We are, though, acutely aware of the interest surrounding the events of 9/11, and most especially the bad history and conspiracy theories that revolve around it.
> 
> In that light, we are opening up the year by addressing it head on. On behalf of the mods and flaired community, /u/tlumacz and I have put together an overview of the events surrounding the attacks of 9/11, including the history of relevant people and organizations such as Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda. This isn't meant to be the exhaustive, final word or a complete history. Instead, we want to provide the AH community with insight into the history and address some common misconceptions and misunderstandings that surround September 11th, 2001. Additionally, as a META thread, we welcome further questions, and discussion — both on an historical and a personal level — of the history and events.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Osama bin Laden and the formation of al-Qaeda**
> 
> To best contextualize the events of the day, we’re going to start with Osama bin Laden. His father, billionaire Mohammed bin Laden, was one of the richest men in Saudi Arabia. Mohammed made his wealth from a construction empire but died when Osama was only 10, leaving behind 56 children and a massive fortune. The prominence of the family name and wealth are two important factors for understanding Osama's rise to power.
> 
> The bin Ladens were generally Westernized and many members of the family frequently travelled or sought out education outside Saudi Arabia. Osama bin Laden, however, was upset at Saudi Arabia's close ties with the West and was more attracted to religious practices. The relationship between Saudi Arabia and the US was established in the 1940s when FDR signed a deal with King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, essentially giving the US primary access to oil in exchange for support and — essential to this history — defense from the US military.
> 
> Osama bin Laden went to college at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in the late 70s. After graduating, he traveled to Afghanistan to help the freedom fighters — known as the mujahedeen — in their battle against the Soviets, who had invaded in 1979. Unlike some young men who joined the battles in Afghanistan and took a "summer camp" approach, spending a few months in training before going back to their home countries, Osama was a true believer. He stayed and committed to the fight. He used his leverage as a son of Mohammad bin Laden and his large yearly financial allowance to smooth over initial troubles integrating into the group. (Note: The United States, though the CIA, also were funding the Afghan freedom fighters against the Soviets. The funding didn’t end until 1992, long after Osama bin Laden had left -- the two were not affiliated.)
> 
> The group al-Qaeda intended as a more global organization than the mujahideen, was founded in 1988 in order to further Islamic causes, Osama played a role in funding and leading from its inception. The Soviets withdrew the year after, and Osama bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia a hero, having helped bring down a superpower. Potentially rudderless, he was energized in the summer of 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. This event kicked off what is known as the Gulf War. Given Kuwait was adjacent to Saudi Arabia, and the enduring close relationship between the kingdom and the US  — hundreds of thousands of US troops were mobilized and housed in Saudi Arabia, with Saudi Arabia footing most of the bill.
> 
> Osama bin Laden tried to pitch the fighters trained up from their years in Afghanistan as being up to the task of defending Kuwait as opposed to calling in the Americans, but his plea was rejected by the Saudi government (Note: to be fair, it is unlikely his force was large enough to handle the Iraqi military, the fourth largest military in the world at the time). This rejection, combined with the fact the US lingered for several years after the Gulf War ended, diverting resources from the Saudi Arabian people directly to the Americans, made an impression on Osama.
> 
> He vocally expressed disgust, and given that the Saudi Royal Family did not tolerate dissent, soon left the country for Sudan (which had just had an Islamist coup) in 1991. Even from another country, Osama kept up his public disdain for Saudi Arabia; family members pleaded with him to stop, but he didn’t and eventually, he was kicked out for good: his citizenship was revoked.
> 
> Meanwhile, he  kept close contact with various terrorist groups — Sudan was a hub — and used the wealth he still possessed to build farming and construction businesses.
> 
> His public resentment for the United States continued, and as he was clearly a power player, the CIA successfully pressured the leadership of Sudan into kicking Osama bin Laden out in 1997; his assets were confiscated and he started anew in Afghanistan, finding safe shelter with the ruling Taliban, a political movement and military force. The Taliban had essentially taken control of the country by 1996, although the civil war was still ongoing. Almost immediately after he arrived, bin Laden made a "declaration of war" against the US. He later explained: 
> 
> >We declare jihad against the United States because the US Government is an unjust, criminal, and abusive government.
> 
> He objected to the US occupying Islam’s holy places (which included the Gulf War occupation), and had specific grievance with the US's continued support of Israel and the Saudi royals. For him, it was clearly  not just a religious matter, but also personal and political.
> 
> Earlier that same year, the CIA established a special unit, based in Tysons Corner, Virginia, specifically for tracking Osama bin Laden They searched for a reason to bring charges, and finally had a break when Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl (code named "Junior"), one of the first to give allegiance to Osama, approached the Americans. He had stolen $100,000 from Osama and needed protection. In return, he offered details about organizational charts and most  importantly, a way to connect Osama to  the Black Hawk Down incident in Mogadishu in 1993. The CIA was working to gather enough evidence such that if the opportunity presented itself, he could be taken into custody for conspiring to attack the United States.
> 
> Meanwhile, the CIA worked to raise alarms among the military and intelligence communities. When George W. Bush won the presidency in 2000 and first met Clinton at the White House, Clinton said
> 
> >I think you will find that by far your biggest threat is bin Laden and the al-Qaeda. 
> 
> Some of the events that led to that assessment included the 1996 al-Qaeda-led attempted assassination plot on US President Bill Clinton while he was in Manila. (The Secret Service were  alerted and agents found a bomb under a bridge). In 1998,  al-Qaeda orchestrated attacks on US embassies in Africa that led to the deaths of hundreds. Then in 2000, they were responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole (suicide bombers in a small boat went alongside the destroyer, killing 17 crew members).
> 
> By the time the warning about Al-Qaeda was shared with Bush, plans for what would later become known as 9/11 were well underway. The plan was put into motion when, in the summer of 2000, a number of Al-Qaeda members took up flight training in the United States. Final decisions, including target selection, were probably made in July 2001, when the terrorists’ field commander, Mohamed Atta, traveled to Spain for a meeting with his friend and now coordinator: Ramzi bin al-Shibh. The nineteen hijackers were divided into four groups, each with a certified pilot who would be able to guide the airliners into their targets plus three or four enforcers whose job it was to ensure that the terrorist pilot was able to successfully carry out his task. The hijacking itself was easy enough. The terrorists used utility knives and pepper spray to subdue the flight attendants and passengers.
> 
> Before we go into the specifics of what happened on September 11, 2001, we want to address the idea of a “20th hijacker.” Tactically, it  makes sense to have equal teams of 5 men. While the identity of the would-be 20th hijacker has never been confirmed (nor has the reason for his dropping out of the operation been established), circumstances indicate he did exist and numerous hypotheses as to who the man was have been proposed. (The most prominent — Zacarias Moussaoui, who was convicted in federal court of conspiracy to commit terrorism — later said he was supposed to be involved in a different terrorist attack, after September 11th.)
> 
> **September 11, 2001**
> 
> Early in the morning of 9/11 four airliners took off from airports in the US East Coast: two Boeing 757s and two Boeing 767s, two of American Airlines and two of United Airlines. All four planes were scheduled to fly to California, on the US West Coast, which meant they carried a  large fuel load. The hijackers knew that once they redirected to their targets, they would still have most of that fuel. The two planes that struck the WTC towers had been in the air for less than an hour.
> 
> American Airlines Flight 11 hit the North Tower and United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center, in New York City. Both impacts damaged the utility shaft systems and jet fuel spilled down elevator shafts and ignited, crashing elevators and causing large fires in the lobbies of the buildings. Both buildings collapsed less than two hours later. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), tasked by the US Congress with investigating the cause of the buildings’ collapse, reported portions of the buildings reached 1000 degrees centigrade. (Note: Not only was jet fuel burning, so were desks, curtains, furniture, and other items within the WTC  While some like to point out this is under the "melting point" of steel [1510 centigrade],  this detail is absolutely irrelevant: the steel did not liquify. Consider the work of a blacksmith; they do not need to melt steel in order to bend it into shape. Steel starts to weaken at around 600 centigrade, and 1000 centigrade is sufficient to cause steel to lose 90% strength, so there was enough warping for both buildings to entirely lose their integrity.)
> 
> A third, nearby tower was damaged by debris from the collapse of the other towers, causing large fires that compromised the building’s structural integrity. Internally, "Column 79" buckled, followed by Columns 80 and 81, leading to a progressive structural collapse where, as the NIST report puts it, "The exterior façade on the east quarter of the building was just a hollow shell." This led to the core collapsing, followed by the exterior. (Note: There is a conspiracy theory related to a conversation the real estate developer Larry Silverstein, and owner of the building, had with the fire department commander. He was heard saying, "We've had such a terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it." However, this is common firefighter terminology and simply refers to pulling out firefighters from a dangerous environment.)
> 
> At 9:37 AM, the terrorist piloting American Airlines Flight 77 struck the Pentagon. The plane first hit the ground, causing one wing to disintegrate and the other to shear off. The body of the plane then hit the first floor, leaving a hole 75 feet wide. Things could have been much worse: the portion of the Pentagon hit was undergoing renovation so had a quarter of the normal number of employees; additionally, while 26 of the columns holding up the second floor were destroyed, it took half an hour before the floor above collapsed. This meant all of the people on the 2nd through 5th floors were able to safely escape. Meanwhile, the Pentagon itself is mostly concrete as it was built during WWII, while steel was being rationed. The steel that was used turned out to be placed in fortuitously beneficial ways. The pillars had been reinforced with steel in a spiral design (as opposed to hoops) and the concrete pillars were reinforced with overlapping steel beams. 
> 
> Note: There is a conspiracy theory that the Pentagon was struck by a missile rather than a plane. This is absurd for numerous reasons, one being the hundreds who saw the plane as it approached the Pentagon (some observers even recognized the plane’s livery as belonging to American Airlines.) Second, nearly all the passengers from the flight were later identified by DNA testing. Third, one of the first responders, a structural engineer, said
> 
> >I saw the marks of the plane wing on the face of the stone on one side of the building. I picked up parts of the plane with the airline markings on them. I held in my hand the tail section of the plane, and I stood on a pile of debris that we later discovered contained the black box.… I held parts of uniforms from crew members in my hands, including body parts. Okay?
> 
> The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed into a field in rural Pennsylvania. The passengers on the plane were able to overwhelm the enforcers and break into the cockpit.  The crash caused no structural damage, and took no lives, on the ground. 
> 
> We now need to rewind to what was happening immediately following the hijacking of the four planes. Controversy surrounds the immediate response of the US military to the attacks, with questions about why the airliners were not shot down (or, conversely, could they have legally been shot down.) In the end, the military response was stifled by communications chaos and the fact that by and large the terrorists did not leave enough time for a comprehensive reaction. The first fighters, F-15C Eagles from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts, were scrambled after the first tower had already been hit. By the time Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy and Major Daniel Nash reached New York, the other WTC tower had been struck. Nash would later recall:
> 
> > I remember shortly after takeoff you could see the smoke because it was so clear: the smoke from the towers burning. . . . And then we were about 70 miles out when they said, ‘a second aircraft has hit the World Trade Center.’
> 
> An additional three fighters took to the air from Langley AFB in Virginia, at 0930. With just seven minutes left before American 77 would hit the Pentagon, the Langley jets would have been hard pressed to make it in time to see the impact, let alone to prevent it. In the end, it made no difference that in the initial confusion, they first  flew away from DC. Finally, two F-16s, those of Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney, took off from Andrews Air Force Base at 1042. Their task was  to intercept and destroy any hijacked airliner that might attempt to enter DC airspace. The rapidity of the order, however, meant that the F-16s were sent out unarmed. As a result, both pilots were acutely aware that their orders were, essentially, to commit suicide. They would have had to ram the incoming B757, with Sasseville ordering Penney to strike the tail while he would strike the nose. The chances of a successful ejection would have been minuscule. 
> 
> Note: modern airliners are very good at staying in the air even when not fully functional and are designed with a potential engine failure in mind. As a result, any plan hinging on “just damage and disable one of the engines” (for example, by striking it with the vertical stabilizer) carried unacceptable risk of failure: the fighter jet would have been destroyed either way, but while the pilot would have a better chance of surviving, Flight 93 could have continued on its way. Therefore, ramming the fuselage was the only method of attack which would have given a near-certainty of the B757 being stopped there and then.
> 
> Further reports and inquiries, including the 9/11 Commission, revealed a stupefying degree of chaos and cover-ups at the higher levels of command on the day of the attacks. While “fog of war” was certainly a factor, and the FAA’s failure to communicate with NORAD exacerbated the chaos, the timeline of events later published by NORAD contradicted established facts and existing records and became a paramount example of a government agency trying to avoid blame for their errors throughout the sequence of events described here. Members of the 9/11 Commission identified these contradictions and falsehoods as a leading cause of conspiracy theories regarding the attacks.
> 
> **What happened after**
> 
> The aftermath, which is beyond the scope of this post, was global. Sympathy and unity came from nearly all corners of the world; a response of force was authorized by the US on September 18, 2001:
> 
> >That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such  nations, organizations or persons.
> 
> The joint US-British effort to eliminate the Taliban began on October 7, with France, Germany, Australia, and Canada also pledging support. Ground forces arrived in Afghanistan 12 days later, but most of the fighting happened between the Taliban and the Afghan rebels, who had been fighting against the Taliban all this time. The international support led to a quick sweep over Taliban strongholds in November: Taloqan, Bamiyan, Herat, Kabul, Jalalabad. The Taliban collapsed entirely and surrendered Kandahar on December 9th.
> 
> In December 2001, Osama bin Laden was  tracked to caves southeast of Kabul, followed by an extensive firefight against the al-Qaeda led by Afghan forces. He  escaped on December 16, effectively ending the events of 2001.
> 
> >We have entered the third millennium through a gate of fire. If today, after the horror of 11 September, we see better, and we see further — we will realize that humanity is indivisible. New threats make no distinction between races, nations or regions. A new insecurity has entered every mind, regardless of wealth or status. A deeper awareness of the bonds that bind us all — in pain as in prosperity — has gripped young and old.

				This is trained military. I’m a veteran, I was an enlisted nurse. I was trained to give my life without question if directed for my country. That’s one of the points of basic training, to break you down and then rebuild you back up to be a soldier- to take direct orders to go into war and sacrifice your life to protect your country and constitution. We sign over our constitutional rights to give our lives to protect it. I’m not asking for thanks, but that’s literally what military personnel are trained, and volunteer today (or were drafted in the past) to do. Does this surprise people? I feel like it should be common knowledge, if it’s not.

					It's not surprising at all on a logical level. I think about it from time to time and it makes total sense. I do consider it common knowledge. 
					
					As a civilian, it's easy to emotionally "forget" though. Stuff like this drives it home. A specific event or circumstance that we can more closely relate to; it allows us to feel that feeling, in a much-diluted form, for just a moment. 
					
					I don't forget, I just get seriously reminded how big of a sacrifice it is. I appreciate the discussion.

						Total aside: Taking about it also helps to put into perspective how our police respond to citizens. They are given military gear and equipment but are certainly not trained like military are and it’s evident in their very disparate actions. The military take life very seriously (for the most part-there are always the outliers). And are subject to a strict justice system (UCMJ) that doesn’t give impartial “qualified) immunity for your actions. I feel like the cops want to think they are a form or type of military but they very much do not act like it or represent US military values. If they did they would appreciate freedom of speech and assembly and all the rights spelled out in our constitution that are supposed to be afforded to our citizens. Eg, for me, seeing someone burn a flag or protest our government like kneeling during the anthem isn’t a sign of disrespect, it’s a sign that I’ve done my very tiny part to protect that freedom that we cherish so they can have a voice and express their anger and disapproval. We are fortunate to have that freedom and no one should act like it’s treasonous or disgraceful.

							You and I seem to agree on much - I wouldn't change a thing of what you wrote. 
							
							Young, impressionable, and poorly-trained (mostly) male cadets who are drawn to violence and aggression are given tools of mass destruction, limited-to-no legal or financial repercussions for their actions, and the keys to the justice kingdom. Like you said, it's no surprise that there are terribly disparate actions. 
							
							I wish that more Americans saw protest as patriotism - I see many only condone protesting when it happens to suit their political narrative, and I find that filthy. There is much irony in telling others to "sit down" or "protest with your vote" then subsequently going out and protesting when your candidate clearly loses. But I digress.

			I really struggle nowadays with the deification of the US military and hero worship that sometimes takes place, because for many, its just a job. My cousin in the navy has never once seen action. I love him and am proud of what he has accomplished, but he's not a hero for his job.
			
			My fiance spent three years in Italy as an infantry paratrooper running training exercises in the Baltics. I adore him, but he's not a hero for what he did, and he knows he's not. He gets uncomfortable any time anyone even thanks him for his service.
			
			This woman and her partner though? I can't even imagine the fortitude needed to know that you are on a murder-suicide mission to foil a terrorist plot and minimize civilian damage. Those two are fucking heroes, full stop.

				I'm a Marine veteran; former infantry.
				
				I agree with you about the military worship.  However, I'd also like to add that every single person in the military contributes to the people on the front lines.
				
				Rangers, SEALs, Army Special forces, and all other front line units rely on people like your cousin, directly or indirectly, to get their jobs done.
				
				For the Marines specifically, we don't have any medical personnel, for example.  It's all Navy.  There's a reason they say Marines stands for "My Ass Rides In Navy Equipment".

			I've read that the force of ejecting alters the flight path/characteristics (example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M2XZEYqIpQ&amp;feature=youtu.be), so they would had to stay with it till the end to ensure a hit.

			Because the risk of having live bombs and loaded guns sitting on the runway all the time was deemed to be higher than whatever emergency circumstances would dictate. Note there are regular patrols of U.S. and international airspace which are always armed, but they would take off from bases which would have a much longer flight time to DC.

They were focused on threats coming into North American airspace from the oceans and the Arctic. In fact, they were even talking about standing down many of the alert fighters. Also, not every air base is an alert base, or even has fighter aircraft.

	First off, a *massive* thanks to you and /[u/tlumacz](https://www.reddit.com/user/tlumacz) for working on this. It is no small feat!

	It really has been quite interesting to see 9/11 tick closer to the sub's scope, for any number of reasons. On the personal level of course, it doesn't *feel* like history. It seems *so* recent, and I have such vivid memories of hearing about it and the ensuing day. 

	For the sub though, the '21 Year Rule' now has to retire as a joke, but it also is interesting, I think, so see how the rule and 9/11 have interacted up to now. We used to get quite frequent questions about it, but as a few mods have observed in our own chats on the topic, it is actually a lot *less* frequent these days, and it likely speaks to the *strength* of the 20 Year Rule, however arbitrary it might be in the specific cut-off that we chose. For myself and the older mods, 9/11 remains a critical, defining point of our lifetime, but we now have mods who barely were even aware of the world around them when it happened, and its only a matter of time before the first mod *born after* joins the team. 

	The purpose of the rule has always been a function of our format, a way to ensure there is some distance between ourselves and the events being written about, and 9/11 has simply been emblematic of that in the past given his place in collective memory... but we really are now moving to the point where is truly *is* history for a decent amount of our readership, or at least hazy events of childhood that were hard to fully grasp at the time.

	*Because* of my own personal perspective, it is hard to really know what the 'Next 9/11' is in these terms, that is to say, what the next culturally defining point is that we're going to darkly joke about eventually fielding questions for, and I'm not even sure there is one of that magnitude. Certainly contentious topics continue to await us on the horizon... the Invasion of Iraq is now two years away, and certainly promises to be big, but not in this way. The Obama years becoming fair game are going to be a *fun time* too, and certainly I don't envy whoever is modding in 2036 (wait, will that still be me!?) and has to start dealing with the Presidential campaign and the Trump Presidency, but is 2040, and COVID, going to be the biggest cultural touchstone we now await? Hard to really say...

	But in any case, 2021 *is here*, and I think that the 20 Year Rule has done its job shepherding us there. Hopefully, of course, I won't regret saying that...

		Speaking of vivid memories: the event still looms large enough I've noticed pretty much anything about 9/11 still leans to "journalism" rather than "history" (you can tell from the booklist authors!) I'm used to dealing with this as a Modern History (tm) guy, but 9/11 is just *extreme* in that respect, and you can often see current politics poke out the corners of books and essays.

		* 🟧 **[marbanasin](https://www.reddit.com/user/marbanasin)** ⬆️ 186 _(2021-01-01 12:39:54)_

			I can only imagine. I feel like we are still very much dealing with a world heavily influenced by 9/11. In the same way someone in 1965 is (or even 1975) is still heavily living in the legacy of the end of WWII and setup of the new world order with the Eastern/Western, Communist/Capitalist divides. 
			
			Like, opening up 9/11 for discussion is one huge milestone to acknowledge that this day is now that much further cemented as history rather than current events, but it really has had a profound impact on so much of what we are still grappling with today both in our nation and globally. Will be interesting to see how we'll need to toe the line for this and many coming years here.

				It does seem to be a very relevant event to our modern world in a way that things from 1999 or 2000 aren’t despite just being a year or two older. I wasn’t active in this (or any) sub in 2011, but I wonder if the collapse of the Soviet Union felt as influential/relevant to the users then as 9/11 does to us in this moment.

				* 🟪 **[Kochevnik81](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kochevnik81)** ⬆️ 16 _(2021-01-02 15:03:48)_

					I've been thinking on this and I think 1991 was different for a variety of reasons.
					
					- While the dissolution of the USSR was a big deal to me and my family *personally*, because of family ties to the region (which meant we watched news about the August coup in real time during Hurricane Bob), a lot of Americans...kind of didn't care. Matthew White (who runs that Necrometrics website) has a half-joke that the William Kennedy Smith trial for rape probably ate up a vaster amount of media coverage. It's actually a big collective retcon that the dissolution of the USSR ended the Cold War: it had already been considered over for a year or so by 1991.
					
					- It was largely an "end" event, in the sense that it was something 75 years old coming to an end. What came next was very uncertain and a massive transition, but it felt less of a "founding" than 9/11.
					
					- To push that point a bit further: 9/11 really created a new world in a way the passing of the USSR didn't quite do. The US is literally still fighting a war caused by 9/11. I just went through airport security yesterday, and interacted with TSA, and took my shoes off, and that's all direct results of 9/11 and 2001.
					
					- 1991 on the other hand ushered in a bewildering period of change, socially, economically, politically, technologically, you name it. The fall of the USSR was definitely *part* of that process, but not really the signalling event. People weren't getting AOL CDs or opening Yahoo email accounts because Gorbachev resigned.
					
					- And on that note, as [u/Inevitable_Citron](https://www.reddit.com/user/Inevitable_Citron) notes, it was an event on the other side of the internet, but I'll look at it from a slightly different perspective. The conspiracy theory thing is true, but it's also simply a matter of us already living in a digital space in 2001 that simply did not exist 10 years earlier. When I look up newspaper articles from 1991, I'm looking at scanned and digitized articles from print archives. If I dig up news articles or op-ed pieces or what have you from 2001, they are as often as not the actual websites I or anyone else was reading 20 years ago, and was sharing via email. It's already something that was happening in a digital world, even if it was one that still relied on desktops and laptops instead of smart phones, apps and social media.

				* 🟪 **[Inevitable_Citron](https://www.reddit.com/user/Inevitable_Citron)** ⬆️ 27 _(2021-01-01 23:28:42)_

					I think the principle difference between the collapse of the Soviet Union and 9/11 is what occurred in between. Principally, the birth and spread of the internet. There have been conspiracy theorist cranks from time immemorial, in America specifically regarding the Freemasons and the Pope. But the end of the Soviet Union still seemed to occur within a shared public sphere. Those who propagated conspiracies regarding it simply didn't have the traction or the ability to re-enforce each other in the way that 9/11 conspiracy theorists have had.

				It's important to acknowledge that 9/11 didn't happen in a vacuum. The anthrax attacks, DC Sniper, as well as having followed the Olympic Park bombing (and Rudolph still being on the run) and the USS Cole bombing all kind of feed together into one giant web of fear and hysteria (in my mind, at least). That fear is what led to an entire reprogramming of American culture - be it the acceptance of increased surveillance, a massive growth in the patriotic flag magnet industry, the realignment of pop-country music with patriotic themes, it wasn't JUST that 4 planes went down, but the entire world before it was left behind. In much the same way, we will eventually "pass" coronavirus, lockdowns, and mask mandates, but a lot of changes have already taken hold in how people interact on a daily basis.

				* 🟪 **[Kochevnik81](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kochevnik81)** ⬆️ 16 _(2021-01-02 15:10:23)_

					As someone living in DC at the time, I *really* want to emphasize this point, and I personally think the anthrax attacks in particular are an understudied part of this phenomenon. It really fed into the general hysteria and narrative of "we are at war and under constant attack", which led to the idea that there needed to be a vastly expanded defense of the (cringe) "Homeland". 
					
					The anthrax attacks stand out in particular because it involved mailings to Congress, among other places, involved weapons of mass destruction (as bioweapons are considered), and was initially attributed to al-Qaeda, and only *years* later attributed to Bruce Ivins.
					
					I think it's a real what-if of history if the anthrax attacks didn't happen a week after 9/11.

					* 🟥 **[davidw1098](https://www.reddit.com/user/davidw1098)** ⬆️ 9 _(2021-01-02 19:04:26)_

						Been a while since I did much reading on anthrax, but if I remember correctly, Ivens just got (unfortunately) lucky with the timing of the anthrax attacks. His department was being defended and he was planning on doing the attack, it just so happened a convenient scapegoat fell into his lap and he took advantage of it. Lines up timeline wise, and makes sense since they're supposedly not linked to Al Qaeda, but those are some pretty major national security blunders, and it then makes more sense that Americans would want to beef up security after multiple prominent embarrassments of our security apparatus.

				It may sound depressing but I think that we’ll only truly let 9/11 behind us when the next big thing happens. The world order all the way from the 40s to the late 90s was defined by WW2. You could argue the 90s were the final resolution of the the WW2 conflict considering the reunification of Germany, withdrawal of Soviet forces from Germany, fall of the iron curtain and the 90s truly ended on 9/11. It is as if this even cut sharply from one age to another.
				
				It is telling that even though I was a teenager back then, living in Eastern Europe when we had much more pressing issues on our hand I still remember when I saw the news on TV. Even though it wouldn’t affect us directly we knew the world had changed.

				I think a great example (since it was mentioned in this thread) is from the 1991 events leading to the fall of the USSR. You have a widely regarded work on these events that's journalism - David Remnick's *Lenin's Tomb*, and a book by an academic historian, Serhii Plokhy's *The Last Empire*.
				
				Remnick's work, both for better and worse, is extremely close to the subject matter. He was writing dispatches from Moscow while the events were happening, and had interviewed and knew major players like Gorbachev just before the events took place. 
				
				What it *doesn't* have is a detachment from the subject matter, either in time or really analytically. Remnicks writing then didn't know how events would play out, and someone's outlook in 1992 would look *very* different from, say, a historian like Plokhy writing his book more than 20 years later. 
				
				Remnicks also was writing based off his personal experiences and interviews, which means his scope of action is very much focused on where he was. Plokhy can delve into much more detail on what was happening in Kiev and how that interacted with events elsewhere. Plokhy also has the benefit of using archival material (a big one in this case is declassified documents in the George H.W. Bush Library), and Remnick doesn't do this at all.

				* 🟪 **[manachar](https://www.reddit.com/user/manachar)** ⬆️ 39 _(2021-01-01 16:55:41)_

					This is a great example.
					
					It's almost like journalism is more of a primary source whereas history will tend to USE primary sources to analyze the event.
					
					So, journalism talking about what I ate yesterday would basically just be a quote from people in the know (my wife and I) whereas a historian would likely use that journalist account along with other primary sources to put my lunch in context (e.g. New Year's Eve, pandemic, broader food traditions of the area, my cultural food heritage, etc)?

				In broadest terms, journalism is covering "current" events, so the key difference is often in the "closeness" of the writer to the event and how the writing relates to the current world, where (I'd argue) historians are less interested in making direction to present connections, though still willing to highlight the various threads of connection to the present. As /[u/Ode_to_Apathy](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ode_to_Apathy) indicates, it's hard to discuss 9/11 independent of the subsequent War on Terror and hunt for bin Laden, the rest of Al Qaeda, and the groups that followed and were aligned with them.

			It's actually going to be a very interesting point for future historians as well. 
			
			Historians of the past have struggled with finding enough information to cobble together a theory of what happened. They can study subjects for decades and only uncover a small portion of what they're looking for. 
			
			Historians of the future will have so much information available to them that their job will essentially change, as the role will now be to pare down the overwhelming amount of information they have access to in order to make some logical sense of it. Weeding out intentional mis-information will be the new archeological dig sites as "facts" get much more difficult to discern from "evidence".

		I was in middle school on 9/11/01 and it is just wild to me that we are now 20 years past that point and have adults who were born around that time. I was just cognizant enough to grasp part of what was occurring but it's only with retrospect and reflection on my life and the culture in the 90s that I've really been able to grasp what that day did to the world in all honesty. 
		
		Great work on this write up and I'm definitely tagging for future reading. This moment fundamentally changed our nation in so many ways and I thinks it's highly critical to keep the record clean on the events to not bog it down further into the conspiracy rabbit hole. Really appreciate this entire community for being so well moderated and agree it is going to be an interesting road as we continue forward past the 20 year cool off period for the other seminole events we've lived through over the past decade or so.

						Speaking as someone who was 1 when 9/11 happened... Has the US really been "at war" my whole life? I remember being shocked when I learned (maybe in 3rd grade?) that we had troops in Iraq at that point. It wasn't even something I really knew about. I'd just assumed I'd know if we were at war, but I really had no clue. Maybe it's because I don't have any family in the military and didn't start paying attention to the news until 2016. 
						
						I guess another aspect of it is that history textbooks in school generally ended at 9/11. Only in high school did I have a history book that went further, and it basically just included 1 paragraph saying that Obama won in 2008 and "is now" the first African-American president. So, I'm sure there's a huge knowledge gap for those of us who are too young to remember the early 2000s but too old for it to be taught in school.

					When I encounter Zoomers who don't remember 9/11, I want to give them a hug, and tell them to be very, *very* grateful that they don't.

				Wow, as someone that was born in 1996, the literal cut off date mentioned in the article I kind of can’t help but agree. Granted I was in kindergarten but I remember watching it live and thinking this was the worst movie ever. I do remember how nervous and jumpy the adults around me became. It was very disorienting when all the adults around you would cry seemingly out of nowhere. I felt like the people I knew somehow were replaced by a shadow of themselves. The xenophobia that erupted from the event made it clear to me that to some Americans my dark skin and ethnicity would label me as “other”. I mean in a way I understand how such a national tragedy contributed to a mentality that led to hostile feelings towards anything foreign but as a kid it was scary when adults would turn on you when you were just grocery shopping with your family. Most importantly, I can pinpoint to those hostilities occurring after 9/11.

			I was working an office job in downtown DC that day and remember events so clearly, down to the clothes I was wearing that day. Riding the subway home and having the train skip the Pentagon station, everyone on the car eerily silent the entire ride. Smelling the smoke in the air from the Pentagon fires when I emerged. My father, living in Crystal City apartment, heard AA77 flying too low overhead, looked out the window and witnessed the fireball as the plane went in. 
			
			The entire day and its aftermath are landmarks for many of us that age, there's a very distinct before and after in memories. It changed so much. It really is hard to believe that it's been 20 years, only 20. The conspiracies around the event really trouble me, and I agree that it's very important to keep factual records like this outside of that.

				The nightmares still haven't stopped, and I only saw it on TV. A friend of mine worked at the WTC and had left just prior to the attacks. She still has survivor's guilt. I think it's those lingering effects that make it still feel so recent.

But I feel like there's been a similar attitude regarding historical events like the Yugoslav wars, where I know very little about it because most people around me seem to just assume I know. It's recent to them, so they think it's obvious in a way that it just isn't to me.

She was a college student at that time and besides the history, she had a lot of personal experiences and feelings that she shared regarding the events of that year. Over this past year, I've often thought about that, and I think it likely that many Gen Z history professors will have a similar subject heading and similar experiences to share with their classes.

		Well said.
		
		I was in elementary school on 9/11, and while I vividly remember the chaos of that day, I was too young to grasp the importance of it. What I really remember is the feeling of that day, the immensity of it, the words left unsaid by the adults around me, their ill-hidden fear for the future.
		
		In terms of the “next 9/11”, it’s interesting because most of the massive change in our world today was not spurred by singular events. In a very William Gibson “Jackpot” sense (his term for a slow multifactor global cataclysm), things like social media and the rise of populist autocrats in recent years have been gradual. That said, acknowledging my American bias, these events strike me as significant in my cognizant lifetime:
		
		* 2005 - Hurricane Katrina (specifically in an American history sense of things).
		
		* 2007 - Launch of the iPhone, the beginnings of the smartphone revolution. 
		
		* 2008 - Subprime crisis, economic crash, and the Great Recession. Election of Barack Obama and the political response of the GOP.
		
		* 2009 - Swine Flu pandemic. 
		
		* 2010 - European sovereign debt crisis. Arab Spring. 
		
		* 2011 - Arab Spring continues. Fukushima meltdown. Global Occupy movement.
		
		* 2012 - Sandy Hook shooting. Xi Jinping takes power in China.
		
		* 2013 - Snowden reveals American mass surveilance program. 
		
		* 2014 - West African Ebola epidemic. Russian annexation of Crimea. ISIS begins its offensive in Iraq.
		
		* 2016 - Trump elected. Brexit.
		
		* 2017 - #MeToo movement.
		
		* 2018 - Yellow Vest Movement begins in France. Jamal Kashoggi assassinated. 
		
		* 2019 - Hong Kong extradition protests. Julian Assange arrested in London. COVID-19 pandemic begins in Wuhan. 
		
		* 2020 - COVID-19, obviously. Soleimani assassinated by US. Trump impeached. George Floyd killing sparks months of global protest and the Black Lives Matter movement. Biden elected.
		
		I welcome all additions and corrections, plenty of important events that don’t reach the global significance of something like COVID or 9/11.

(I thought of leaving out that detail because it is kind of eye-popping, but it is important for Osama bin Laden's context, in that he was the odd one out of a very large set of children, not just one or two.)
		
		Yes, the CIA/FBI communication breakdown was very much a thing; I give a brief example [in a different comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/kocf1z/meta_an_historical_overview_of_911_as_the_20_year/ghq9p0l/).

		Not a historian, but I was in college when the 9/11 Commission Report was released and read it when it came out. Believe it or not, it was kind of a hot seller, they made it into a book and on forums like Something Awful it was a huge topic of discussion. It was released around 2 years after the commission began researching the factors surrounding the event in question. You can grab a copy from a million sources, including here - https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-911REPORT/pdf/GPO-911REPORT.pdf
		
		Despite being a generally uneducated ~19 year old musician at the time, I remember very clearly the sections about the failure of intelligence agencies leading up to 9/11. Sometimes it was just lazy people not conveying information, sometimes it was spiteful people trying to make another agency look foolish, etc. This is a big part of the justification for why the Homeland Security department was created, by the way. And the Director of National Intelligence. Although they were created before the report was released, there was much early talk about the need to put these various agencies under one roof so that a 9/11 event doesn't happen again.
		
		I don't have time to reread the report and give you the citations, but you can go through it yourself. Chapter 3 is about a particular kind of communication breakdown - where old school people didn't take seriously the idea of what modern terrorism was capable. It also explains some passive issues, like how terrorism cases take the longest to build up and are run out of a single office so at the time they tended to be isolated while agents moved slowly and did not get higher priority in briefing those above them. Etc etc.

	I never knew about the assassination plot against  Bill Clinton in Manila, nor the fact the fighter jets were scrambled without weapons and that the pilots were prepared for a suicide mission. It's just a little fact that really puts that day in a bit of a different perspective.

	If I may, I remember 9/11 vividly. I was 18, kinda rootless, and had just been let go from a commitment to join the USMC a few months before (which should tell you how different a time it was, they just let me walk, no reason to keep pushing on a dude to join a peacetime military). I woke up early because I'd fallen asleep early the night before, so turned on ESPN to see Monday Night Football highlights, and they were talking about the first plane to hit the tower. As I was watching, the second plane hit. 

	It was surreal, and, I think, if you weren't really around before it, I don't think you can understand how jarring it was. Now we're locked in the forever 'War on Terror', so the mindset is different, but back then it was shocking. It truly changed so much about America, easily the biggest crossroads of the millennium for us.

	I remember hearing about the plane that went down in PA, how crazy that story sounded. So much tragedy, but how those people, and the first responders in NYC and DC reacted, a lot of heroes too.

			While obviously the Good Friday Agreement is still relevant, it’s become ‘settled history’ at some point in the last 3-5 years.

It's just long enough for a cohort of people to have been born and become adults in the intervening period, and reddit skews young demographically so those young people will be a good chunk of the user base.
				
				There is a pretty radical difference in mentality between people who lived through the troubles (even just the tail end of it) and the post-troubles generation that are coming up now. To them the GFA is a fixture of the constitutional framework of NI, and has been since before they were born. Very different from those who remember how uncertain everything was both during the peace talks and in the ensuing decade when it seemed as likely to all fall apart as to stand the test.

			Coming at it from someone familiar with Russia, Putin has been around for this entire time (his term as prime minister included), and one can argue that there is both considerable change, and not so much in terms of looking back like this. Without getting to into the modern aspects of things, the Russia of 2000 (when Putin took over) is a lot different than the Russia of 2021, though the seeds of that change can be quite clearly seen in hindsight.

			They did it using a combination of local forces, mostly Northern Alliance ethnic Tajiks who were already fighting the Taliban in the Panjshir Valley, US army Special Forces (green berets), USAF combat controllers and CIA officers.  The SF guys coordinated with the the NA guys and worked with them on the ground while the combat controllers (also on the ground) directed precision air strikes that devastated the Taliban which at that time was operating out in the open.  The operation was called Jawbreaker and was so successful that I think it gave the US a false sense of confidence which may have helped in creating the conditions for future blunders.

				This false sense of confidence can’t be over stated and in my opinion, directly lead to the blunder at Tora Bora. It was astonishing how fast the Taliban were routed. This led to the risk adverse mindset at Tora Bora. SF and local partners had worked spectacularly up until that point so the brass was extremely hesitant to deploy the troops they needed to seal the border with Pakistan and entrap bin Laden. Now, there were legitimate logistical concerns, I believe Sean Naylor in Relentless Strike mentions the airdrop to seal the border would have stretched tanker support to the brink, but isn’t a shot at grabbing the most wanted man on the planet a good enough reason to move heaven and earth to make it happen? Had we nabbed bin Laden at Tora Bora, are we still in Afghanistan 20 years later? I know there are a lot of what if’s, but I think it’s perfectly valid to state our history in Afghanistan looks a lot different if the Pentagon brass and Rumsfeld had decided that some risk was worth the reward. Especially considering Iraq was already going to happen and Afghanistan was a drain on resources for that campaign.

	As we start pushing into "shit I remember happening", I'm really looking forward to how much of what I remember happening was either inaccurate, forgotten, or deemed unimportant enough to have made it into official records. 9/11 is forever seared into my memory, as a teenager living in New York at the time. For me it has never and will never feel like "history", it's a deeply personal event, forever changing the skyline of my city, and the lives of countless friends and family (including someone who was orphaned at my school).

	Will users here ask about, or remember the rumors of 8 planes being hijacked? Rumors of bombs on the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges?

		There isn't. The CIA funneled the majority of funds to Mujahedeen groups through Pakistan's intelligence service (The ISI) which in turn dispersed them to groups that it worked with. It should be noted that Bin Laden's group did not have a financial relationship with the ISI either. While some people have made the claim that the CIA funded Bin Laden, either directly or indirectly, it has never been proven and most scholars have agreed that Bin Laden's group was primarily funded through other means, including Bin Laden's own families wealth.

			Thank you for stating this, I was looking through the comments to find this. The Afghan Mujhadeen was a very broad coalition of loosely affiliated insurgent groups (which represented different ethnic groups and religious sects) spread out all over Afghanistan.  
			
			Foreigners (like Osama bin Laden) often created their own groups (like MAK) which fought side by side with more experienced native insurgent groups. These foreign groups were self funded and didn’t need any support from the CIA/ISI. Likewise on the other side, the CIA and ISI had no desire to fund these groups- these groups were generally too small to make any noticeable difference on the battlefield and were poor fighters compared to the native Afghan groups (these foreign fighters were also responsible for the major mujhadeen defeat at Jalalabad in  1989 which ended up extending the war by several years).
			
			Since the Soviet Afghan War, no proof has ever been shown showing that the CIA/ISI supported Osama bin Laden and all parties allegedly involved (CIA, al Qaeda and ISI) have denied any association. This lack of association has been supported by scholars like Peter Bergan, Steve Coll, and Marc Sageman. 
			
			Saying the CIA funded the mujhadeen til 1992 and Bin Laden was a member during that time period without mentioning this context perpetuates bad history and numerous conspiracy theories on [u/jbdyer](https://www.reddit.com/user/jbdyer) ‘s part. Otherwise this post has a lot of good information.

I consider it an important part of history to learn, for us who weren't there to experience it. Now, I've got one piece of barely related trivia, and one question too.

	1 I remember being told by my mum about how she sat in my grandparents living room, seeing how the television changed to show what was happening, how a reporter pointed at a tower and said it had fallen, while it still was on screen. Today I assume it's greenscreen. But that living room, and it's the same living room I've been sitting in while reading this, it feels fitting.

	2 You said one of the planes only had four hijackers, which one was that? Was it the one hitting pentagon, was it the one hitting the southern or northern tower? Or was it, as I suspect, the one which was landed mostly safely?

		You suspect correctly (though perhaps for the wrong reasons): the plane with a four-man hijacking squad was Flight 93, the one which crashed in Pennsylvania.
		
		The fact that Flight 93 never made it to its targets likely had nothing to do with the lack of one terrorist. Rather, passengers revolted because that had been informed about the events in NYC and they understood that they would certainly die otherwise.

		* 🟧 **[adamshell](https://www.reddit.com/user/adamshell)** ⬆️ 110 _(2021-01-01 13:13:03)_

			Additionally, Flight 93 was delayed 42 minutes and departed at 8:42 AM which was only 4 minutes before Flight 11 would strike the WTC North Tower. This extra time gave families a chance to relay the events of the day to passengers on United 93 and allowed for an offensive plan. There's reason to believe that passengers on other flights would have presumed that they would return safely to the ground and held as hostages; Flight 93's passengers deduced that was unlikely because of the fates of the other three flights.

		* 🟧 **[Isord](https://www.reddit.com/user/Isord)** ⬆️ 52 _(2021-01-01 16:04:34)_

				> Tom: No, I'm not. I'm on an airplane that has been hijacked.
				
				> Deena: Hijacked?
				
				> Tom: Yes, they just knifed a guy.
				
				> Deena: A passenger?
				
				> Tom: Yes.
				
				> Deena: Where are you? Are you in the air?
				
				>Tom: Yes, yes, just listen. Our airplane has been hijacked. It's United Flight 93 from Newark to San Francisco. We are in the air. The hijackers have already knifed a guy, one of them has a gun, they are telling us there is a bomb on board, please. (call ends here)

		Probably the biggest missed opportunity was when two of the hijackers (I believe two of the ones who eventually hit the Pentagon) landed in California with the CIA's full knowledge, but they didn't add them to the terrorism watchlist until too late. There was a window where the FBI could have easily picked them up, but they weren't notified, and a message in the queue meant to alert them was not approved. (Some of the FBI folks are still quite bitter about this, and they suspect the CIA was wanting to flip them into being informants.)

	Though I just wanted to point out something I had noticed while reading and I wanted to clear it up,

	>(Note: The United States, though the CIA, was funding the Afghan freedom fighters against the Soviets. The funding didn’t end until 1992.)

	While this is most certainly true, it needs to be pointed out that the CIA sent the majority of funds through intermediaries (most often Pakistan's intelligence service, the ISI)  before they ended up with the Mujahedeen groups in Afghanistan. Steve Coll goes over this quite a bit in *Ghost Wars* if you want more of an understanding of how specifically the US supplied funds and arms to groups fighting the Soviets and Soviet backed forces in Afghanistan.

	For added clarity, it should also be pointed out that Bin Laden and his group was never funded by the CIA, either directly or indirectly. This is a claim that is often made with no evidence backing it up, and even Coll himself has had to point out many times in interviews throughout the years that the claim is baseless. At the end of the day, there were dozens if not hundreds of independent Mujahedeen groups fighting in Afghanistan at one point or another during the Soviet Occupation. While many of them did see some funding or arms shipments sourced from the US, not all of them did, and that includes Bin Laden's group. His group was primarily self-funded through Bin Laden's own wealth as well as other sources. Having said that however, I want to also point out that this doesn't necessarily mean that the CIA or the US did not play a rather large role in creating the conditions in Afghanistan that allowed Bin Laden to return after the war and use the country as his base of operations.

	I have a simple question that I’m not seeing an answer to so far: Was there a clear intended outcome of the attacks? Simply to spread fear and paranoia in the US? I understand bin Laden declared Jihad, but he also must’ve predicted that the US would retaliate, risking a worse outcome for himself and his people.

	I have a question about the function of your overview. You mentioned Osama escaping from US forces on December 16, 2001, but left out Donald Rumsfeld refusing to give the order to move in. (Source: Tora Bora Revisited, https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Tora_Bora_Report.pdf ) The question is this: was this done to keep the overview as nonpartisan as possible, or was it seen as irrelevant to the historical overview?

		Just what happened there is a very complicated topic that would eat up a lot more space than I really had room for. I did specify it was essentially a Taliban vs. Afghani fighter battle; the general opinion is that more US troops would have helped, but this is controversial enough that it would take much more detail, and just blaming Rumsfeld as an aside would leave too much hanging.
		
		(Other stuff left out include: the messy nature of different groups being "al-Qaeda", not really just one; the exact nature of the relationship between Osama bin Laden and the Taliban; the degree the CIA/FBI disunity caused missed opportunities.)
		
		In any case, you're welcome to ask about it as a standalone question!

		Nope, since there hasn't really been a need.
		
		First, they did investigate, rather thoroughly and exhaustively; some 40 SEC investigators alone were involved in tracking down almost every single trade.  Second, the stocks were generally not shorted; the unusual part was the sheer volume of put option activity, which is far more leveraged than shorting - but also a routine part of hedging.
		
		And the reason there's not been anything further to come out of this were answers like this when the FBI and SEC came to pay a visit - there's really not all that much more *to* investigate because by and large hedging strategies were responsible for the vast majority of options written pre-9/11.  From the 9/11 report appendices:
		
		>"The UAL trading on September 6 is a good example. On that day alone, the UAL put option volume was much higher than any surrounding day and exceeded the call option volume by more than 20 times—highly suspicious numbers on their face.170 The SEC quickly discovered, however, that a single U.S. investment adviser had purchased 95 percent of the UAL put option volume for the day. The investment adviser certainly did not fit the profile of an al Qaeda operative: it was based in the United States, registered with the SEC, and managed several hedge funds with $5.3 billion under management. In interviews by the SEC, both the CEO of the adviser and the trader who executed the trade explained that they—and not any client—made the decision to buy the put as part of a trading strategy based on a bearish view of the airline industry. They held bearish views for a number of reasons, including recently released on-time departure figures, which suggested the airlines were carrying fewer passengers, and recently disclosed news by AMR reflecting poor business fundamentals. In pursuit of this strategy, the adviser sold short a number of airline shares between September 6 and September 10; its transactions included the fortunate purchase of UAL puts. The adviser, however, also bought 115,000 shares of AMR on September 10, believing that their price already reflected the recently released financial information and would not fall any further. Those shares dropped significantly when the markets reopened after the attacks. Looking at the totality of the adviser’s circumstances, as opposed to just the purchase of the puts, convinced the SEC that it had absolutely nothing to do with the attacks or al Qaeda. Still, the SEC referred the trade to the FBI, which also conducted its own investigation and reached the same conclusion."
		
		>"Another good example concerns a suspicious UAL put trade on September 7, 2001. A single trader bought more than one-third of the total puts purchased that day, establishing a position that proved very profitable after 9/11. Moreover, it turns out that the same trader had a short position in UAL calls—another strategy that would pay off if the price of UAL dropped. Investigation, however, identified the purchaser as a well-established New York hedge fund with $2 billion under management. Setting aside the unlikelihood of al Qaeda having a relationship with a major New York hedge fund, these trades looked facially suspicious. But further examination showed the fund also owned 29,000 shares of UAL stock at the time—all part of a complex, computer-driven trading strategy. As a result of these transactions, the fund actually lost $85,000 in value when the market reopened. Had the hedge fund wanted to profit from the attacks, it would not have retained the UAL shares.
		
		In other words, these particular firms had already covered most of the naked puts the time the market opened - something that didn't show up in the initial reports about the unusual volume of options since the volumes of the underlying equities weren't all that notable (and in many cases, were already owned.)
		
		And last, one other point not noted in the 9/11 report was liquidity, and that brings up something that has almost entirely been forgotten in the two decades since - that the US stock market was closed from 9/11 until 9/17, its longest stretch since World War I.  Paper gains are all well and good, but they're meaningless if you can't actually execute a trade.  Having utterly no control over your portfolio for 6 days was bad enough, but one of the most remarkable things about 9/17 was that during the first few hours of intraday trading during that chaotic morning was that the most affected companies like airlines actually had their stocks hold up pretty well - so in order to properly profit from the nefarious shorting myth, they'd not only have had to get the timing right beforehand, but also have an iron stomach afterwards while they sat around wondering if they'd gotten the fundamentals right but the market's reaction to them wrong.

	Wonderful write up; I learned a lot. Respectfully, might it be wise to alter the wording here:

	>The passengers on the plane were able to overwhelm the enforcers and break into the cockpit. The crash caused no structural damage, and took no lives, on the ground.

	To clarify that while no lives were lost on the ground, the 44 people on the plane were killed in the crash? The phrase 'took no lives' may be confusing to someone unfamiliar with the story of flight 93.

	Having read Ghost Wars I find the omission of Massoud and his Northern Alliances near complete control of afghanistan pre 9/11 a strange omission. I suppose that's the trick of any historical post, keeping what's important while not expanding too much.

	Not mentioning Osama having him assassinated two days before 9/11 is a big oversight imo and was the biggest revelation in ghost wars.

	Great write-up.

	For a first-hand perspective from the aircrews who were scrambled that terrible day, I highly recommend these three sources:

	It's part of a larger documentary, but @ 2:50 they feature some interviews from a couple of Canadian CF-18 pilots who were scrambled to intercept suspect aircraft. They talk about what is was like having to face the prospect of having to do the unthinkable:

	There's also the chilling interview with Major Heather Penny [u/AB1908](https://www.reddit.com/user/AB1908) posted, where she describes having to potentially use her own aircraft to bring down a hijacked airliner:

	Thank you very much for that writeup ! It is very interesting but I have two questions regarding it, from the book *Les Guerriers de l'Ombre* (2017, Editions Tallandier) from Jean-Christophe Notin, where he make several claims which I had difficulty to find corroborating works. In this book, he interviews former French DGSE officers (DGSE is the French foreign intelligence service).

	His first claim is about the Talibans' welcome of bin-Laden [pages 215-223], the author states that bin-Laden was welcome as a former brother of arms (from the Soviet-Afghan war) but generally disliked (J.-C. Notin also claims the Arab volunteers were not liked during the war either, but welcomed as the Afghans needed men to fight). According to the interviews, bin-Laden was much closer to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar than the Taliban. The book goes on to state that the Taliban started to support bin-Laden following the missile strikes from [Operation Infinite Reach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Infinite_Reach#Attack_on_Afghan_camps), which were supposed to kill bin-Laden while he was present at a *Loya Jirga*, but he was warned by the Pakistani ISI and the missiles only killed Afghan leaders (angering the Taliban).

	The second claim is in regard to the period between 9/11 and the coalition's attack on Afghanistan on 9/23/2001. The author states that an assembly of around 600 ulamas (Sunni scholars) petitionned Mullah Omar to kick bin-Laden out in order to protect the country from destruction in the war as they stated the Taliban were not involved in the preparation of the 9/11 attacks but merely hosted former brother of arms [pages 232-233].

	What is the validity of those claims ?

		This doesn’t address either of the claims specifically, but it’s worth emphasizing just how different the Taliban and bin Laden were theologically. My favorite example is that, while bin Laden was doing interviews with cable news channels, Mullah Omar, the leader of the Taliban, refused to have his picture taken because he was apparently worried it would lead to *shirk*, idolatry. From an article I love by sociologist Charles Kurzman called “[Bin Laden and Other Thoroughly Modern Muslims](https://kurzman.unc.ed[u/files](https://www.reddit.com/user/files)/2011/06/Kurzman_Bin_Laden_and_Other.pdf)”:
		
		>While most well-educated Islamists [including all Al Qaeda groups] disdain relics as verging on idol worship [*shirk*], Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar literally wrapped himself in the cloak of the Prophet—a cherished relic in Qandahar—one April day in 1996. 
		
		This is the standard Salafi position (a large theological camp that includes the theologians of Al Qaeda and also those associated with the Saudi state): we want to destroy tangible objects and monuments that could possibly be seen as mediating one’s relationship with God. That includes relics like the prophet’s cloak or hairs from the prophets beard, and also shrines/tombs to local holy men and those associated with the prophet or his family. See the [Wikipedia page for destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_early_Islamic_heritage_sites_in_Saudi_Arabia). The Taliban, on the other hand, loved these traditional sorts of material religious practices tombs and relics (well, some of them—there were good shrines and bad shrines. The Taliban certainly bombed several shrines associated with Sufis or Shi’as.)
		
		The Taliban allowed bin Laden to stay in Afghanistan, but it specifically asked him not to engage in politics (i.e. things like waging war on the U.S. and Saudi Arabia). The same Kurzman piece also mentions:
		
		> the Taliban had an entirely different social base [from the more very educated Al Qaeda]. According to an Egyptian Islamist, top officials of Al Qaeda considered their Afghan hosts to be “simple people” who lacked the “ability to grasp contemporary reality, politics and management.”
		
		In short, while we can describe both the Taliban and al Qaeda as Islamist revolutionaries who want to reunite mosque and state in an imagined “restoring” a sacred order to state and society, the order that they imagine on very fundamental levels are different.

	Thank you team for this great write up! Like many people I can certainly remember where I was on September 11th as it all happened. (Distinctly, I can remember coming downstairs to find my mum crying as the tv was one.)

	That said, I think the parts that most impacted me was the quickly expanding Afghanistan war. I knew people who went off to fight, and some who didn't come back, and that really impacted young me.

	Also, since it's a television adaptation and thus won't be on the reference list, I'll second the recommendation by /[u/theghostofme](https://www.reddit.com/user/theghostofme) for the 10 part miniseries *The Looming Tower*, which combines much of the excellent Wright book of the same title with the Soufan memoir.  Soufan certainly isn't shy about using the series to settle scores as he takes a hatchet to the CIA, but given the massive policy and intelligence failures involved, can't say I particularly disagree with his choice.  Definitely worth a watch regardless of whether or not you've read the books.

This is untrue, and the dedication never mentioned mujahideen-the commonly circulated image featuring that is photoshop.

	Thank you. 

	9/11 happened when I was in 4th grade. I was raised to ask questions and think critically, but we know what can happen when skepticism goes too far. For many years, I read deeply into the conspiracy theories surrounding this event and ate it all up. There is a certain power that comes with "knowing the truth" (at least, thinking you know something others don't), and people don't want to give up that feeling; I didn't want to give up that feeling. For many years I said it was all a cover-up and instead of seeking out dissenting opinions, I only looked for information that confirmed my beliefs. Well, it's been nearly 20 years and my zeal for conspiracies has waned. I hadn't really even thought about 9/11 for a long time until I just saw this post. Although short and simple, it actually very plainly outlines some facts that I had remained willingly ignorant of for many years. The main point that always bugged me was that there didn't seem to be any formal acknowledgement that the perpetrators were Saudis. Knowing that, I always found it suspicious that Saudi men attacked us on 9/11, but as a result we attacked Iraq and Afghanistan? But this makes it clearer. The attackers may have been Saudis, but they were Saudi *rebels*. They hated their own government, much like many Americans. They were terrorists and they were not aligned with the Saudi government, because the Saudi government are allies to the United States. It makes total sense. 

	Let it be known, people can change their minds about things. 9/11 was just the result of some global politics and religious zealotry gone wrong.

	I have a couple questions, prefaced that the attacks were obviously a scary and uncertain time:

	1) How many people were in the planes that had hit? I know of people that had missed their flight. 

	2) What safety precautions have been had to preventhigh jackings? (If this breaks the rules skip it)

	3) Prior to 9/11 and the aftermath how common was Islamaphobia? Such as in the 70s-90’s? 

	Also for the mods or anyone interested the one class I wish I was able to take at my university was called The History of Terrorism, taught by Professor John A. Lynn II, he has a great resource knowledge and authorship regarding further information to dig into historical context and origins of terrorism.

		I'd like to ask a related question to this, as well. I was in sixth grade when 9/11 happened, and I have no recollection of ever being aware of Islam before that day. I lived in a very rural area and was certainly fairly sheltered, but I'm curious how 9/11 changed the perceptions and awareness of Islam in the United States. The country's relationship to the religion is without a doubt still tainted by the events, to the point that it's hard to say that relationship has ever moved past them.
