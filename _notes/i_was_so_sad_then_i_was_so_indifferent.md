## I was so sad, then I was so indifferent

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1c5vn8p/i_was_so_sad_then_i_was_so_indifferent/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1c5vn8p/i_was_so_sad_then_i_was_so_indifferent/)

> So I do taxes. A client came in who usually brings his stuff in super early. But he came in right before the deadline. I was like man why are you so late? He then told me the saddest story about watching his wife die earlier this year. It absolutely killed me. Then he told me that he has stage 4 cancer and the treatment makes him so sick. So when his wife died he gave up on his treatment.           
> As soon as he left I went in my office and put my head down and wept.               
> There was like 100 people "in line" before his return to be done. But I was so moved I went ahead and did his. I know if he passes and owes money (which he does) he wouldn't want to burden his kids with it. Plus man, that was the saddest shit I've ever heard.            
> So yesterday (3 days since he came in) and just in the nick of time for deadline, I finished his return and called him to come in and sign the forms.           
> He came in today. And when he saw his return he was like "whoa why do I owe so much. Biden was supposed to fix this, but he lied again lol".                          
> I had to bite my tongue. I can't talk politics on the job. I I'm was just like "and sign here as well" just totally ignored him.                   
> Like, did he forget that Trump raised middle class taxes? Bro you voted for this.         
> Then before he left I said "I hope to see you next year" and he was like "probably not. But it's ok I can't live in biden's America".               
> And that's how I went from compassionate to indifferent in the span of about 6 minutes.              
>                      
> ETA: since so many people don't think I know how to do my job, the guy had more interest and dividends this year and didn't pay any voluntarily federal taxes on his social security. Oh and he bought and sold stock with sizable wash sales. He was also given estimates last year that he didn't pay. Oh and I didn't even mention his comment about "obummercare".               
> Listen. I'm at my wit's end with boomers but especially maga boomers. Most older clients who come in to pay us ask if I even know what a check is and ask if I can read cursive (I'm 40. Of course I do) But then the maga ones sneak in a cheeky lil racist comment or 5. Especially about the immigrants' rights advocacy center next door to my office. You wouldn't believe how causally they say this shit too. Like "oh he's white so he must agree". No, Gladys I Don't agree but you just paid us $1400 for your taxes and financial planning on your personal shit and are due for another $650 shortly for your rental property business quarterly reports. So yeah I keep my mouth shut.              
> Hey, I might be an asshole cause I'm sick of boomer shit. Whatever. But you're extra an asshole for assuming so much about me when I told a story to vent and I kept it vague to protect client info and concise to get my point across.

	I get a lot of this doing hospital social work. So many boomers are just now realizing how much long term care costs. “Why doesn’t my Medicare cover this? Why is my Social Security so low?” Stop voting for politicians who tell you they’re going to cut the funding for these programs. That includes you. You aren’t the special exemption.

		This. 
		
		Watched my dumbass father support the “no social services” party for my entire life. Then he got cancer and wanted to know why our healthcare was so shitty and so expensive. Listened to him repeat that maybe 400 times in a 6 month battle with cancer. Finally one day he started again, “don’t see why if the government is meant to be so good they can’t give us healthcare for a decent price, it’s so hard…” and I snapped. 
		
		“Why is Americas healthcare so bad? Why is it so expensive? Because dumbasses like you voted for that you idiot. And now not only is it screwing you but it will destroy mom when you are gone and she still has to pay, and your two liberal sons will end up paying your bills. And that will suck because neither of us will get social security because you destroyed that on your way out too!”
		
		Wish I was wrong, but he died, and we paid the bills, and I am not seeing any great budgeting news for social security lately. Expecting to go 3 for 3 on that.

						From my perspective growing up deep in that sort of ecosystem, they oppose them either because they don't believe those benefits should exist in the first place ideologically, or that it will hurt the sort of "undesirables" more than it will hurt themselves.

							Heather McGhee’s book “The Sum of Us” is about exactly this. White working class people will (and have) repeatedly vote down measures that will benefit them if they perceive those measures will also benefit Black people. It’s why they closed public pools in the South for a generation. The wealthy still had their own pools or the pools at private (expensive) clubs, but when public pools had to be shared with “others,” working class whites preferred to shut them down.
							
							So many Americans have internalized this attitude, along with a weird magical thinking that somehow they themselves will be the exception who gets what they need, and if they don’t, it’s the other guy’s fault.

If they will also benefit whatever out-group they don't like (POC, LGBTQ+, Immigrants (legal)), then they are against it. They would rather hurt everyone than help themselves if it might also help "others". Like the idiots that went all bonkers about "hands off my welfare", while simultaneously claiming that their welfare was EARNED by them, but those lazy urban (i.e. black) folks were just stealing THEIR tax money by being on welfare they did not earn.  Like others say- make it make sense?  It does not.  But that is how fucked their thinking is.

To hear them complain about Medicare not covering this or it’s really expensive for that and they don’t understand why my dad’s injectable medication for his MS is like $1000 a month. Since my dad hit Medicare age under Biden apparently it’s his/the current Dems fault things are this bad and it would “never be anywhere near this bad under Trump”. They do not like hearing about some of ol’ W’s policies like legalizing high deductible healthcare plans or that all of this could be funded afforably if Obamacare wasn’t completely neutered.

Like laying in bed for hours, pale and nauseous, in so much pain that I'd hope to pass out but never did. I had to leave school and go home when it got so bad that I could barely function and just wished to pass out to get relief from the pain.
			
			Of course they are coming for birth control now. I've been on it since I was 18 (expect for a few years where I was really broke and had no health insurance and struggling with other health issues.)Universal healthcare would have been nice and would have helped a fuckton.

			My mom is finding out the hard way now. She’s got breast cancer and is on the hook for some hefty bills. She was complaining to me about it and I flat out told her she voted for this. She’s voted hardliner conservative her entire life, complained about social safety nets being for the lazy poor and the “dirty, lazy minorities” except the word she chose started with an n and ended with a hard r. 
			
			This is one of the many, many reasons why I’m liberal. No one of *any age* should have to spend their time worrying about medical bills during a catastrophic illness. They shouldn’t worry about getting quality care or the right drugs or the right therapies or worry about *any fucking thing* except getting better. State colleges should be FREE or so low cost a part time job could cover your expenses and tuition like it did when my parents were college age. Minimum wage should keep up with inflation and allow two adults and one child to live a decent, middle class life. 
			
			I admit I yelled at her over the phone. I’m not *proud* of it, but Jesus tapdancing motherfucking CHRIST! It took until it happened to *HER* for her to realize that social safety nets are fucking important for everyone. 
			
			I told her to talk to SIL to find out what state and federal programs she might be eligible for. Food stamps. Senior housing. So she can sell her house and pay her bills but still have a decent place to live. 
			
			It’s so fucking frustrating and feels like a post for the ohnoconsequences sub.

	This woman comes in with the sadly usual story of how she lost her job, can't find a new one, is losing her housing and needs to find storage, etc. it hurts to hear every time.

	I walked her through our job club and upcoming job fair, and went to get her our street card which explains a person's rights in public areas, loitering laws, where to get free food, and the info for the local shelters.

	She flipped out saying she could never go to a shelter with all the drug-eating degenerates who will assault her on the spot - using a lot of slurs. I stared at her, all empathy drying up in an instant. When she tried to continue, I just said "Ma'am no one *wants* to hit rock bottom, and don't go making enemies down there" set the card on the counter in front of her, then walked away.

				Also for anyone reading this, fulfilling the executor role of an estate can be a huge pain in the ass (did it for my dad). I'd recommend finding a good lawyer to do it all for you. You'll need a lawyer regardless, you just need to decide if the additional cost of them handling the estate is worth it to you.

			This happened to me once, it was an error on their end. I had worked so much OT and DT that the system assumed I would that much money biweekly for the whole year and I had gotten bumped up a tax bracket.  This was the perfect storm of my base pay being just above minimum wage, working seven days a week, and pulling 80+ hours that week. I was working at a water testing lab and there had been some sort of contamination at a cities well so they had to test all of them multiple times for the two weeks. I got a huge refund at tax time but I did tell them something was up.

				Even if it would have put you in a higher tax bracket that makes no sense, under a progressive tax system you would still pay the lower rate on everything up until you crossed into the next level, it wouldn’t just apply to every cent you made

		>OT was taxed at a higher bracket.
		
		I'm so sick of this misconception. It's just used to trick people who don't know how taxes work, especially blue collar republicans who will easily believe it and then vote for the person who promised to lower taxes because all the democrats want to steal from hard working people. 
		
		OT is withheld at a higher rate because it seems like more money is going to be earned throughout the year, so they withhold more. Your paycheck should still be higher unless another factor affects it. Your tax rate is determined at the end of the year by your income earned *throughout the year*.
		
		You could make $100k in the first week of January (and no other money during the year) and it's going to be taxed at the same rate as if you made $100k throughout the entire year.

My favorite way to redirect them is waiting for them to throw out a comment on “the way this country is going”, and I respond with “I know EXACTLY what you mean.  I can’t imagine being a child and fearing for my life every time I’m in school.  I mean, it’s bad enough being the parent!  One time my daughter texted me that they had just all been moved into the gym and the school was on a lockdown, and there I was frantically trying to think of the best place for my 13 year old to hide to not be murdered!  Can you imagine?” 

	Inevitably, they try to justify that is “we need more mental health care”, to which I then respond “oh I couldn’t agree more, Gary!  It’s absolutely shameful that we spend more per capita on our healthcare while at the same time people can’t afford to have a hospitalization!  Our veterans are homeless because of the lack of support and people can’t even get in to see a psychologist to even try to get help for their mental health!”  I just keep pivoting the conversation away from the Fox News talking points and toward things that they should care about but don’t think about.

	One Boomer told me his grand plan for keeping schools secure and I’m not joking, when he was done I looked at him and said “George, you literally just described a prison.  You’re describing our children needing to be inside a prison during the day in order to try to keep them safe.  And half your ideas would kill all the children in the event of a fire.”  He kind of paused and was like “damn, you’re right about that one.  Damn.”  I took care of him for 3 days and was 1:1 for a lot of it so we had a lot of chats that I wouldn’t normally have with my patients.  He told me I made him think about a lot of things he hadn’t before and even changed his mind on some topics.

	I wish people wouldn’t bring up politics all the time. We had 2 different contractors make weird racist comments to my husband , maybe they just assume my husband agrees with him because he’s a middle age white guy like them.  Jokes on them, we are both leftist, we just don’t speak of things with causal strangers and acquaintances. Just talk about sports, the eclipse, vacation plans or better yet don’t say anything.

	Not to mention it was Trump’s 2017 tax cuts that changed things, not sure how that’s Biden’s fault.

	You should he allowed to at least cite the time line. "Actually these tax changes were put into effect several years ago."

	Should have just applied for an extension, then another extension, then just not file.  IF I got a year left to live, for real, the govt. can argue my taxes with my estate.
