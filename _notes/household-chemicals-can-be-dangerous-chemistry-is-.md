## Household chemicals can be dangerous.

![[3011272861013936166.mp4]]


Chemistry is a very interesting and potentially dangerous for those unfortunate enough to make a reaction like this happen on accident.

‚ö†Ô∏è do not mix these on purpose! ‚ö†Ô∏è 

Other household chemicals like these should be kept separate.
bleach and vinegar = chlorine gas aka mustard gas
Bleach and ammonia = chloromine
Bleach and rubbing alcohol = chloroform 
Hydrogen peroxide and vinegar = perecetic acid

Knowing what these do doesn't make you a terrorist,  but what it does do is keep you and your family safe. If you're ever exposed to a caustic, unknown gas-- seek a well ventilated area and call EMTs
