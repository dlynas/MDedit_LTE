## I watched the videos by Sabine Hossenfelder on YouTube...

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1c7zbgz/i_watched_the_videos_by_sabine_hossenfelder_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1c7zbgz/i_watched_the_videos_by_sabine_hossenfelder_on/)

> And now I'm crushed. Have a look at her video ["My dream died, and now I'm here"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKiBlGDfRU8) for reference. Her motivation to pursue academia sounded a lot like my own at the moment. The comments of her videos are supporting what she's saying and it all feels too real to ignore. I'm terrified.
> 
> I'm currently a sophomore undergrad student who wants to do some theoretical work in the sciences (more towards math, physics, and chemistry). Most likely a PhD. But now I'm horrified. I'm driven mostly by thinking and discovery as well as being around like-minded people, but it sounds like academia is not what I thought it was. I am afraid that I'm being naive and that I will not enjoy doing research because of the environment built around publishing.

	I wouldn’t completely ignore her videos. But the rest of her content is quite sensational, to put it nicely. She has valid complaints, but you will find some more fault of her own in the situation if you dig into her career a bit

			She was working in a very niche field and, unsurprisingly, interest and funding ran dry.
			
			That sucks, but it's ultimately the fate most academics will face. What she did wrong after that, was devoting her whole public existence on lamenting how all of physics is being done wrong and building a "skeptic" online persona, all the way to offering paid consultations to crackpots, and publishing purposely inflammatory pop-sci videos, even outside of physics.
			
			Her mistakes are quite easy to avoid. Just don't become the Alex Jones of physics.

				Thanks, you said this better than I could.
				
				It’s really hard for me to have sympathy for her downfall when she spent her entire career bashing physics while pushing something completely unfalsifiable (super-determinism), and doing repetitive work on that interpretation. It’s unfortunate, though, because she has some good points about why academia is flawed, but it’s misleading to people that she didn’t take very much personal responsibility

				That was not my takeaway from the video. She never said his physics is done wrong and how her way is the right way. Her quip with it was how delusional it can be:
				
				It seems very fancy in the movies. Scientists getting together, having civilized discussions, writing letters to each other, wanting to advance the field, take science further.
				
				But that image was shattered when reality hit. It was about managing egos, no longer about advancing science but just getting grants. Publish or perish. Publish or perish. Publish or perish. Cannot find an answer? Invent a new particle. New particles are hot rn? People researching only those will get the grants. Others? Tough luck.
				
				Not all scientists are passionate about finding particles. Some want to research something else. And denied grants not because the work is not promising but because it isn't the hot field right now will be disheartening. For any scientist. 
				
				They pursue Ph.Ds and postdocs because they like their field so much only to be told their interests don't matter currently. It is hurtful.

					>that was not my takeaway from the video
					
					Her reputation doesn't come from this single video, but rather her library of content. She spends more time ridiculing other scientists and fields of research than teaching anything substantial. Her fanbase consists of those that "doubt convential scientific wisdom", which is to say crackpots, generally.
					
					The video isn't wrong exactly, but it's good to take her with a grain of salt due to the deeper context of her online persona.

					She deserves zero sympathy or attention.

		Yep. Her perspective is 1) just her perspective, 2) based on her country’s system and field, and 3) 30ish years old. 
		
		What got under my skin was her critique of grants/the granting process. The work we do isn’t free, so of course it needs external support, and it’s not our money so agencies get fund literally whatever the hell they want based on parameters they set. It’s up to us to make the case that our work is valuable *to them.*
		
		Yes, some people game it, but most don’t. I’ve reviewed for a ton of agencies and bad work doesn’t make it through more often than not. And agencies are increasingly willing to take chances on work. 
		
		I’m also skeptical of those who critique the profession only after failing at it. I do value their perspectives but I find most critiques to be over generalizations of personal experiences/hardships. Those of us on the other side do the same thing, mind you, which is why everyone should do research about their field and their community before making life changing decisions.

			While I think her critique of grants/granting maybe a little too pessimistic, I think yours may be a little too optimistic. I think that many, if not *most* applicants try to "game" the process, it really just depends on how you define that term.
			
			I am just a recent PhD grad, and I've only participated in preliminary data collection/writing small pieces for R01 applications thus far (about 4). However, across many collaborators I have had almost universal "gaming" experiences. Some quick examples being things like: 1) proposing measuring the quantity of some metabolite in tissue, and making it sound feasible, when our lab had been trying to do the methods proposed in the grant for *1-2 years* with no success, and the collaborating PI saying essentially he does not think it's possible. 2) proposing experiments in more complex models (being vague here intentionally) although we had tried and failed, admitting internally, and already beginning experiments with, cell lines as an "alternative approach". 
			
			The proposal in (1) was written because it would be very impressive and several groups have been trying to do this for a long time (although it is likely impossible), and the proposal in (2) was written in that way because there is more impact, obviously with the proposed model (although realistically it also may not be feasible). There are other examples, but the granting process to me seems like "shooting for the moon and landing in the stars". Current status is that both were funded.
			
			Although debatable on what is considered gaming, some people (myself included) view this as "gamey" when many times the authors seem to *know* that the work they are proposing will not end up looking like what is proposed, especially in cases where the work has already been tried and failed for some time. Idealists (which I was) like to think that science and science funding works by proposing something and then trying it. However, nothing is that straightforward when so much money and people's livelihood is on the line. I don't think it's *as terrible* as she makes it seem, but I do think there's a moderate level of *bullshit* in grants. I'm not even going to touch on professional development or environment supplements.
			
			I may have just interacted with the few people who do things like this, but this is all I know. However, my lab and the labs we collaborate with are big names in my field with multiple R01's, so I don't know.

			* 🟦 **[Cicero314](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cicero314)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-19 22:04:39)_

				That’s fair. I think it largely depends on the interaction between the field 
				and the incentive structure of one’s home institution. Good science is often slow and we’re not really allowed to go that slow anymore.

				* 🟪 **[gradthrow59](https://www.reddit.com/user/gradthrow59)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-20 09:27:51)_

					I don't quite understand what you mean. Granting agencies are typically federal, so you still have to play the game no matter how your home institution's incentives are set up.

					* 🟥 **[Cicero314](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cicero314)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-20 10:58:20)_

							Sure, but I feel like this is kind of dodging the conversation. You said her critique of the granting process got under your skin, and our conversation is about this process. Whether or not getting a grant is heavily valued by an institution has no bearing on the fairness or "non-gamey-ness" of the process that we are discussing.
							
							In other words, if someone voluntarily opts out or decides not to "game" and thus doesn't get many or any grants, they're still losing out in a bad process, regardless of whether their institution minds or not.

				The places I've been at, the PIs are no longer involved in the work itself. They follow the hot news and write grants that they can't do themselves - then that becomes PhD projects for the unending flow of foreign students. They are then pressured to deliver the results promised/expected by the salesman PI who is nowhere to be found most days.

			The problem isn't bad work making it through, it's anything novel being blocked. Some researchers are spending more time on applying for grants than researching or teaching. And then you have to incorporate whatever the newest trend is into your research if you want grants, whether it makes sense or not. 
			
			
			We're going to apply AI/ML to single cell RNAseq of CRISPR-something! Does this bring any new biological insight? Nobody cares.

			* 🟦 **[rappoccio](https://www.reddit.com/user/rappoccio)** ⬆️ 16 _(2024-04-19 18:06:49)_

					Eh, not the experience of the people I know in theoretical physics. They try to get support from supervisors and other decisionmakers to pursue their heterodox ideas, fail, then write the millionth irrelevant string paper. Then they're able to make a career from that (or find something better to do).
					
					
					In general, the "convincing people" part becomes a catch-22 because all of the successful ideas that sound plausible at first have, for that reason, already been explored. In terms of funding, it would make a lot of sense to fund work that has a lower chance of success, rather than work with a high chance of success and a high chance of being uninteresting.

				Novel research does get funded if you make a compelling enough case for it. Provide some preliminary experimental or computational results to demonstrate that a novel idea is potentially viable. Why should you expect taxpayer funds to go into entirely unmotivated lines of research on a PI's say so?

					That implies one has sufficient funding to begin with to generate that preliminary data.

			> 30ish years old.
			
			This part is not... quite true. But I'm sure she'd be flattered that you thought it was the case. :-)
			
			I think the bit about her age is relevant only inasmuch as she is in a different life and career position than the OP. I can't (and won't) speculate, but her age is often a point in one's life where one takes stock of things and sometimes changes direction. Certainly I have done that (I'm a little younger than she is, but also not "30ish", alas).
			
			I think in her case it might be worth pointing out that she is a deliberately heterodox thinker in her field. Sometimes that works out, sometimes that leaves one isolated. I'm not in her field so I can't really say whether she should find more success among her academic peers than she does (I find some of her ideas compelling — like her critique of the obsession with "beauty" in theoretical physics — but again, I'm not in her field). But it makes perfect sense to me that someone who has taken that position, found it not to be appreciated by her peers in her field, and who has found alternative sources of career satisfaction and presumably income, might decide to jump ship altogether. But I am not sure it is a generalizable case.

			Here’s her opinion article about why she thinks particle physicists are frauds. This is pop-science, and she is speaking as a figure of authority, absolutely misleading the public.
			
			She is also a huge proponent of superdeterminism, ie the idea that the universe isn’t inherently random and that there’s some hidden variable that we can‘t measure that’s controlling the universe. This by itself isn’t a bad thing, what’s a bad thing is that she misleads her YouTube audience into believing this to be truth, even though it isn’t even falsifiable.

	Yes, she has some valid points. It's broken.

	At the end of the day, however, it's a job.

	In your situation, be very realistic about pursuing a JOB - not a calling, a mission, a passion - in your fields.

	The job market is tight and extremely competitive in hard, theoretical sciences. As a market, it is also subject to the influences of economic forces and rules. Publications and grants for better or for worse are the currency of academics who are in a competitive labor market. This is no different from other competitive industries who have their broken and idiosyncratic methods for running their labor market.

	Other fields and disciplines (e.g., health-related fields with access to NIH funding, STEM fields with access to private and public funding) have larger pots of funding and revenue streams sustaining their professors' activities. Thus, the job market is still tight, but much less brutal than the job market for pure mathematicians or theoretical physicists looking to advance theories that don't align with public and private priorities. Remember, academia is a JOB, not a collection of people on a holy mission to advance science.

	Anyway, make sure that you're speaking with a variety of people who have differing opinions about academia. I would say that the types of toxicity that are particular to academia are not terribly different in quality or quantity from whatever you'd find in other industries. Sure, academia attracts a lot of neurotic and highly driven people with poor social skills. But is there really a substantial difference between these people and the neurotic and highly driven people with great social skills running management consulting operations? And one can hear horror stories from any management consultant or wall street or big tech exec. Ditto in medicine and nursing. Very high burnout rates and very high proportion of highly driven and neurotic people.

	I bailed on academia for many reasons after my postdoc, but my experience is just my experience.

		If there is one thing I wish every fresh PhD student had drilled into them their first week in grad school, this is it. Academia may be a particular kind of job that appeals to particular kinds of people. It may even be your dream job. But it is still just a JOB. We have a different word for "doing what you want to do" - it's called a hobby (and I highly recommend having one or three of them).
		
		Referring to the OP, most of the academic job doesn't really consist of "thinking, discovery, as well as being around like-minded people". There's a fair amount of that, to be sure, but most of the job is work just like any other.

			>There is plenty of toxicity in industry, but maybe it is less surprising to find it there?
			
			I'm thinking about going into academia in my 40s but I'm concerned the toxicity would be a big step up from my field (engineering.)
			
			In industry we're toxic to each other over understandable things: money, women, and just as a natural part of trying to figure out which of us is the smartest and hardest man, and who is a dumb wussy who's not a real man.
			
			But academics sometimes try to destroy each other over *ideas*. That's a degree of depravity I can hardly imagine.

	Then again, I am in academia and, after a heck of a lot of work, have arrived at a place where I am not only content but outright happy with my work.

	I see it this way: 

	Every professional field has the Subtance and the Game.

	Very few people anywhere can be Substance 100% of the time. That’s called a hobby. So unless you are independently wealthy and treating this as the hobby of a true *amateur* (lover), you must play the Game also. If that’s okay by you, academia might be a suitable environment for you.

	In that case, consider what your goal is. Maximal survivable Substance? That’s probably something like 80S/20G. Maximal advancement? Switch those ratios around and play the Game as much as you can while staying credible.

	I would say I’m 70S/30G, and it has landed me in a position where I am free to pursue my interests, get paid for it, and even make a difference.

	I think Sabine H. is a fine YouTuber. But she is clearly no team player and has zero willingness for the academic Game. That’s no dig – no one needs to be those things. 

	YouTube, nevertheless, is also a Game, a different kind of Game, and she certainly has plenty of that. It just might be that the highly quantified, user data driven online environment suits her better than the more ”unspoken social rules” watercooler environment, which academic departments definitely are.

		I like this way of breaking it down. I've wanted to be a scientist my whole life and am currently going back to school to make that happen. I see so much on here and other sites abput how competitive and soul crushing academia can be. But so many of the complaints I hear from people are all things that currently happen to me without even a shred of science or academia involved. Starving? Check. Psychopathic boss/supervisor? Check. Godawful coworkers? Check. Tedium? Check. Mental health deterioration? Check. Job instability? Check.
		
		Academia may still end up worse than I'm expecting but God it would feel nice to take a punch to the gut over something I actually care about than to keep working jobs that will never get me close to living my dream. 
		
		I'm so willing to sit in an office and send emails, feign respect for narcissists, go to meetings, process large sets of data, write grants, etc. I can play the game if it puts me even one step closer to the sort of research that interests me.

	Just be aware that many/most PhD grads don't end up as professors, and many are happier for it. 

	If you're driven by discovery, you might have fun if you pick the right environment. Academia is all about working your tail off to have options. Be aware that you will be working hard just to work harder, if you want to stay. 

	I'm hoping to graduate next spring and I've had a great time! I'm one of the last people in my cohort to still want to become a professor, but now I'm being exposed to industry positions that want to hire PhDs in my field, which is pretty tempting. I just want to go somewhere where my training is honored. What a ride it has been; I'd say that PhDs really can deliver on what they're made out to be, but nobody asks you along the way what you actually want from life, and you'll be too busy to stop and think about it. Once again, environment is key. And being somebody who can take joy in the process and remember that most deadlines are made up. Good luck!

	An important stage in the development of any would-be academic is when you realize the Ivory Tower is very broken. Once you figure that out, you can strategize more realistically. It doesn't mean you can't do what you want to do-  but you also have to understand that we aren't all sitting around talking about our research and other intellectual pursuits. Most of it is just a grind like any other job. It's hard and competitive and not everyone is going to be able to do it.

	I refuse to consume any of Sabine’s content, but I can imagine what the video is about. 

	Academia is a job like any other. That’s the first thing you need to realize. And like any job in the real world, even though academia gives you a ton of intellectual freedom, you can’t expect to just do whatever you like and be rewarded. That’s not how anything in the real world works.

	In high energy theory, you really do have an astonishing amount of freedom to do what you want while you’re in the field. But yes, the chances of turning what you have as a student or a postdoc into something permanent are small. That’s not the fault of academia itself: everyone is disappointed when young people leave. The funding and interest from universities just isn’t there to sustain everyone. 

	So you have to play a game of doing things that people care about, and convincing people that what you do is worth caring about. That’s a tough, and often unfair game to play, subject to all of the usual human failings. But that’s just true of anything humans do. Academia isn’t somehow magically free of that. 

	I have to say, in high energy theory, generally it is true that people who play this game well are also pretty awesome, and what they do is genuinely interesting. I think the field does a pretty good job in the end. With some experience, it is not difficult to see why Sabine didn’t manage to get a permanent position, unfortunately. She is also playing the game in her own way, however, and playing it very well, by pivoting to something that a much larger audience cares about, and generating lots of controversial splash constantly like any social media star does, frequently to the detriment of her own original field.

She makes it seem like MOND is more awesome than it seems, while at the same time writing papers that say MOND is not as good as CDM at fitting things like rotation curves, and like yeah, we’ve known that for a long time… but that’s not what her online persona says! 
			
			She also doesn’t say anything constructive. It’s super easy to criticize, especially when experiments get null results. But what’s the way forward? Her papers on dark matter are strangely focused on superfluid DM which, okay, is not not interesting, but it is oddly hyperfocused on one model which isn’t super motivated.

			This is my opinion about her, formed by watching about a dozen or so videos over the last couple months. 
			
			She is very opinionated, states her opinions as facts to an online audience of laymen and her opinions are not always is alignment with empirical evidence.
			
			Her sensationalist videos tend to critique entire fields of science rather than teaching, labeling them frauds who gsme the grant system to make a buck. This attracts an audience with an existing distrust for science in general.
			
			She markets herself as a sort of Judge Judy-esque "hit takes from someone who tells it like it is" persona, and sells her consultation services for a premium to conspiracy theorists.
			
			There is also an undertone of bitterness in her videos, I find. Especially in her String Theory video, she expresses anger at the scientists for pursuing what she sees as a dead end, but comes of almost envious of the continued support for their research projects.

	Furthermore, on a personal note, the fact that you are "crushed", "terrified", and "horrified" by her videos suggest that you're either exaggerating for effect or sort of dysregulated about the whole thing.

The line can be somewhat fuzzy because there is a lot of overlap. Theoreticians can fit in either one, because they can provide valuable context for designing experiments. In any case, applied science is a majority of scientific activity.

	What if I said it doesn't have to be decided for you now?  I think the community of scientists is really like you describe, just a bunch of curious people trying to solve problems and puzzles with science.   There's downsides to every job and complexities.  But to worry about the downsides to not pursue a passion that you could is silly.

	There may come a time for you to make a decision, but it's not now.  You can get some experience for the next few years in labs and learn what academic lab culture is like and see if the bug bites you.  If not, you can get some experience in industry too, maybe that's your cup of tea.  Many people work for a year or two before going back to grad school, so the path isn't just a straight one for most people.

	That said, publishing ones findings is the unit of "work" that is produced in nearly every lab-based environment.  If you're not writing a paper about your work in academia, you might be writing a white paper to your bosses in industry, or similar.  There's ups and downs with doing scientific work - but don't let one aspect of the job turn you off yet.

	On the other hand, you should be careful with taking advice from professors on these topics. For whatever reason, these are per definition the people who made it in the system.

	Sounds like you have some really specific interests… that’s great if you’re thinking about doctoral work! 

	So this is the thing… in the US, there’s way too many grad students *relative to the number of tenure-track jobs especially at R-1 research institutions*. This is true for all fields, but how bad the overproduction is is different from field to field. I can’t speak to what the situation is for other academic job markets but I think this is a problem in other countries as well. The reason for this is tenure lines have been eliminated, and also because institutions, departments, and faculty are incentivized to crank out as many doctorates as possible. “Dissertations completed” give points toward tenure or the next tenure step for people who chair dissertations. Departments use grad students as highly skilled cheap labor for teaching, research, even administrative work. Universities suck in grant money supporting these grad students and their research while benefiting from their underpaid work and frequently wind up owning their IP depending on the type of research. 

	However!!! There’s tons of jobs in industry, especially for STEM. Have you thought about what work you would like to do that’s not “being a professor”? If there’s people doing work you might be interested in after a doctorate in your area — maybe a national laboratory, maybe a private company — it might be a good idea to look up some of these folks or try to contact the institution and see if they have a mentoring program and see if there’s folks you can have a cup of coffee and find out more about their careers and career trajectories generally. I’d say sophomore year is too early to give up your dreams, but not too early to start refining your vision of a career. Start reaching out and talking to people… You’ll get advice relevant to your specific interests

	It might help to consider asking why getting a PhD is important to you? What salary and work expectations will jive with your values and quality of life? 

	Throughout my undergrad and graduate schooling I also worked as FT staff in academic medical research. Initially I had every intention of pursuing a PhD but after years of learning what that ACTUALLY looks like, I realized I could still pursue my love of research, work in a field I knew well, and hit the ground running professionally - in academia - with “just” a masters degree. Ten years post-grad and I can confidently say this was the right choice for me. I contribute significantly to grant writing, manuscripts, research design and implementation, and engage in community outreach and advisory boards where I can share my skills and knowledge. For me, a salary of $110k is perfect for a low cost of living region. I work for the state and have excellent benefits, a flexible schedule, and work from home most days. Also, if I really wanted to, I could pursue a faculty position (I’ve opted to adjunct at the local Comm College instead 💚). 

	The quality of my life is good, I know the value I bring to the team and there’s always a new project on the horizon to keep things interesting. 

	Admittedly, having a good mentor throughout this time has helped, but that would be true in most professions. I liked the idea of staying in academia and becoming an expert in my field without a PhD and found it was possible.

	I am a freshman student come August, who wants to do some research in my undergrad and move onto a PhD. As someone who has observed my professor parents do research, it isn’t that Hossenfelder’s criticisms are bad, but it is that they are sensationalist, and that they are presented in a way that is meant for communication to a wider audience, not the scientific community. The flaming disaster she presents, well, although what I find as sensational might be true, I still believe that this is just the experience of one person, and the idea that all of it is like this, I am just a tad bit skeptical.

	Hossenfelder has also not made the greatest videos occasionally, with her videos on capitalism, neurodivergence and transgender healthcare coming to mind. They were all awfully researched, and even my mild attempt at verifying her statements yielded the toxic fruit of an ideologically questionable worldview, not to mention her speaking about stuff that just seemed like capitalising on a current issue in general science or political state rather than communicating the actual research. In other words, just being a video essayist, albeit one with a PhD that she uses for credibility of her worldview.

	I wouldn’t put your entire worldview in the hands of this one researcher, who admittedly also works in a deeply competitive field where she might have just gotten unlucky, like many researchers do. Academia positions are hard, and even I, someone who wants a PhD and wants to do research as a career, have had to acknowledge with some advice from the professors and academics I know. I may not get that job as a researcher, but I can use that PhD in industry (at least in what I am pursuing) to still perform research, and at least, that is what I am taking away as my positive.

		You're absolutely right with your points about dr. Hossenfelder. Just wanted to comment because you haven't actually attended university or engaged in the academic world yourself, and seem to be basing your comments on your parents' experiences (or at least the ones they shared with you). This is familiar territory for me so I just wanted to somehow convey something I learnt a bit later in life, which is that our parents' experiences are probably a bit biased because a) they are from an older generation, and have therefore have probably suffered less competition than the current generation of junior researchers is facing, and b) they "made it" and are therefore always looking at academia through the lens of survivor bias.

	I am sorry for that woman in the video, but I wouldn't generalize her bad experience. There are a few toxic research groups out there, but the situation has improved a lot since the years described in the video. And that is not special about academia but about the work culture in general. It's not ok anymore to bully your employees in a company or students in a university like it was acceptable 40 years ago. Famous professors have since gotten demoted or fired for unprofessional behavior. 

	Regarding the criticism of the whole scientific system as only focused on quick production of publications without substance: nowadays, there is rigorous oversight over how tax money is spent on research and I think that is a good thing. There are people like Hossenfelder who argue that scientists should be given millions of tax dollars and then be left alone for many years to work on obscure topics. This can work, but 90% of the time it will be a waste of resources. Science globally is advancing at an incredible speed so I don't think there is a structural here.

		Nope. I don't think you really understand what OP meant. Academia is broken, fair and square. Operationally, yes. But, more so, in the way it sets goalposts for young researchers.
		
		Think of any academic career path, and yes, I know everyone is different and all paths are unique. But, all paths visit the same town, same cities and face the same dilemma one after the other. Publish and Perish model exists brutally. To get in a competitive Master's program, you require funding via grant or scholarship, which often.ends up being determined on your published work in undergrad (which itself is sad). To get ahead, from Masters to PhD...the same cycle repeats. if you're in STEM, you face the blunt of this model heavily. Not to mention, how conferences and journals itself are ranks on almost arbitrary metrics. Yes, there have been changes. Journals like Quantum are being adapt for their open-source diverse, fast and quality peer review process where top scientists have already published their work in it.. but for most fields..still OA without OA charges is a dream. This added to the fact that not every Uni funds OA charges for publishing.. since all Uni are not funded proportionately. Not everyone in academia works in top Uni, and if they don't their path to a stable academic life becomes more long and convoluted.
		
		The role of your advisor in your PhD also exceeds the freedom exercised by a corporate boss. Think of it, this. You're 30. You have skills. You get a job on those skills. If you're boss is shity, at the least (yes, I am excluding certain extreme cases) you can think to change your job. Right ? If you're in middle of your PhD...and your advisor starts treating you like shit... what's the exit plan? change advisor in a uni you are new at ?? how many are even able to think of that? quit PhD , and then what ? enter the job market with a delay of certain years with a lower qualification??
		
		I could go on and on. Academia is rigged, fucked game by all standards. as someone too deep in this game, i only have one advise to OP
		
		" Good. Be aware of the worst. Read more blogs or watch vids of academics mentioning the flaws of this system. After all that is done, think carefully and introspect whether you wish to enter academia (what motivates you to get a PhD or be a scientist) or not. And if, you still say yes, continue down the path. Don't forget what you learned from knowing all flaws (lest your shall be surprised and caught up in frenzy).  The journey is tough even if you are lucky to never witness its flaws...but to ignorant of it, is more dangerous to your motivations (that will be challenged by the rut of pursuing research) than just losing inspiration down the path, albeit transiently"
		
		expect the worst, hope for the best...but for that - be aware of what is the worst and imagine what could be your best :) best of luck..

			There is quite a bit wrong with this...I read hundreds of PhD applications for a very good university in a very hot topic field, and we do not require publications for admission. A PhD in my home country cost me nothing (I earned money) and did not require a Master's to begin. In my current country, there are funded Master's opportunities, although they are few and far between for international students. All PhD students we admit to my program, even the international ones, are funded and given a stipend--we do not admit self-funded PhDs. 
			
			That's not to say there aren't issues, and escaping (or finishing in spite of) a shit PhD advisor is one of them. Job stability and work/life balance is another. The game is still such that with a CNS paper doors open that may not have otherwise, but the system isn't as fucked or rigged as you are saying, at least not in all countries and at all universities. I admit I haven't seen Sabine's videos (I am quite unimpressed with her after her response to some questioning after a conference talk I attended, but that doesn't make her point invalid), but not everyone is in the midst of this awful hellscape of publish or perish shit. Some of us have lines of research that we enjoy; we put out a few papers a year and go to a couple of conferences while teaching a class or two a semester or year.
			
			OP: I love my job. It sucks sometimes, but all jobs suck sometimes, and usually the suck is manageable. It's also a lot of fun sometimes. I get to travel a bunch and talk to a lot of people who are super smart about really fun stuff. Working with students who are cleverer than I am is a lot of fun.
			
			There are also plenty of reasons to pursue a PhD without academia being the be-all-end-all--I joke that the smartest people in my field go into industry because that's where the money (and a lot of the innovation) is. I'm in academia because (a) I generally get to choose what to research or who to collaborate with, (b) I don't really give a shit about a company's bottom line or selling widgets to customers, and (c) I love working with students and postdocs. That's not to say that folks in industry are bad or wrong, quite the opposite! I have great friends in industry who are amazing, brilliant people.

			I agree there are some things that, structurally, can only lead to abuse, or at least greatly facilitate it. Like the power an advisor has over their students, the fact financing is often tied to the advisor or at the very least institution, how things like dropping out of a PhD are perceived culturally adding to the pressure... 
			
			I was very lucky to have great advisors but I know people who weren't so lucky and it was *hell*. The worst years of their lives. To the point of deep depression, suicidal thoughts and so on. They can make you feel worthless, powerless, and like you can either waste years of your life while dishonoring yourself, burn a whole lot of bridges thanks to a well-established perpetrator, or muster up the courage to survive many more months to a few years of abuse. 
			
			I think it's a good thing grad students are speaking up, and better established people as well, so that perhaps the perception of someone dropping off of a PhD becomes no longer "what a worthless failure" but perhaps "something might have gone wrong outside their control". 
			
			Institutionally, things need to change as well. I can only take France as an example because it's what I know best, but similar things probably apply elsewhere. There is a supposedly independent authority overseeing your PhD, called a doctoral school. At the end of each year, you have a meeting with doctoral school representatives, supposedly impartial people, that you are told you can talk to about problems with your advisors. Most often, these impartial people are colleagues and friends of the advisors, because these things are not taken seriously. The mentality is "oh it's just a formality, don't worry about it, I'll ask so-and-so to sit in and sign off on it". In my case, I had no issues, and these representatives were actually not linked to my advisors. But my GF had, each year, a representative who was the godfather of her advisor's children. Very impartial! 
			
			But even in the optimal case, like it was for me, I could have complained, and what would have changed? It's my advisor's money. Even if there had been a problem, and I had been listened to, not much could have been done. They might have tried to mediate, and then if the conflict is born of bad faith and not simple miscommunication, then the issue won't resolve itself and the student can either drop out or put up with the situation (probably aggravated by the outside intervention, too). 
			
			I think it would be a good thing to structure PhDs such that the student themselves requests and receives the funding. This would give them more control. It would also train them for a crucial aspect of the job down the line. And it would lighten the workload of prospective advisors. Only a minority of PhD grants in France follow this model, the immense majority is obtained by the advisor or group, and then offered to a candidate. The drawback is advisors wouldn't be able to direct PhD work as tightly, and this also poses a problem, seeing how academia is structured. There might need to be fewer PhDs and more support staff (e.g. research engineers). I don't know, but something needs to be done.

			I can't really agree with anything you say, except one thing: PhD students are stuck in a long-term contact (3-5 years) which they can't leave. That's bad, but that's about it. 
			
			>To get in a competitive Master's program, you require funding via grant or scholarship
			
			Never heard of that anywhere. Im in life sciences and I have worked in USA and different European countries. 
			
			>Publish and Perish model exists brutally.
			
			What does that even mean? If you don't publish a lot, then you won't become a professor but you can still get a nice job in the industry, companies don't care about publications. Is getting an industry job the same as "to perish"?
			
			>their path to a stable academic life becomes more long and convoluted.
			
			A stable academic life means being a professor. Thats a job where you make about $100,000 a year, have no oversight, completely flexible hours, creative autonomy and job security for life. Of course there are more applicants than open positions, it's a dream job. You can't expect that to be easy.

				Oh my God!
				
				You do realize people exist outside US and Europe, right ? Not everyone is rich and is able to fund their journey in academia, be it at any stage - Master's or PhD or PostDoc
				
				
				I guess, I should prefaced all of this with - academia also brings out the disproportionate development of R&amp;D opportunities amongst countries.
				
				So, when I say for Master's you need a funding, it's on the assumption of someone entering academia on their own. No funds of their own, no family support. Single and independent path to forge. For most, such is the case.
				
				People need funds to live and to pursue a degree. Especially, if you happen to emigrate to a new country for your Masters or PhD. (obviously someone from US might nor relate with this)
				
				Publish and Perish model means what it says. Again, it would vary based on sector. STEM industry, especially industry positions in AI, or even simple computer science positions often require publication in high quality journal or conference. Even if they don't mention it, everyone knows quite well your application wouldn't be high priority or highly ranked without good publications ...
				
				job prof salary varies country to country, state to state...its a dream job that comes at a cost often too heavy to pay
				
				
				Your answer also showed, something in my opinion, wrong with academia. disparity in discourse discriminate those who suffer under it :)

	You seem to have a deep misunderstanding that doing science and rational scientific thinking, analysis  is the same as being in academia . 

	Once you clear your thinking on the matter , new opportunities you didn’t know existed will open up. 

	Just to point specific examples : greatest advances in AI have come from industry labs , biggest advance in protein folding came from industry , there are many others.

	And you are at least right that academia is not at all what you imagined . It is generally not at all about deep thinking or science , it is about getting grants and funding so you can continue a lab and pay students . That also needs a steady stream of publications to sustain said grants. 

	Some good science happens by accident sometimes but definitely not by design.

	If you want to have a good shot at doing impactful work, reconsider all plans to be in academia and broaden your vision for life . You can still be in academia if you lower your expectations and understand that grant writing and writing a volume of papers is part of the game of survival . Some good science may come on rare occasion but don’t think everything getting published is gold. It is not, and especially so in recent years I’d say 95 percent of stuff published belongs in the trash bin.

	My wife has a PhD in the humanities so cannot be considered and apples-to-apples comparison, and she is also around Sabine's age I think so the perspective might also be age based, _that caveat given_ she had much more trouble finding work than did male colleagues and this experience was mirrored by other women in her field.

	Now, it is really important to note that there are structural reasons for this that make it much less straightforward than Sabine's story or my wife's entirely communicate. For example the males in her field were generally (not entirely) under more pressure to be bread-winners and also some of those women had spouses who were already more financially secure and that financial security sometimes dictated where people moved to, which is a huge problem for academics: they have to go where the very limited number of jobs are.

	But that said she certainly encountered some laughably obvious and inexcusable sexism from ppl who, imho, were way less deserving of academic stature than my wife. And she was pretty good at playing the game. Those women we knew who insisted on being treated with the same gravity as men frequently found themselves in trouble for no reason other than the men (who were older and in control of the field) didn't want to do that.

	Hearing Sabine's story I was struck multiple times by parallels to my wife's life and the lives of other women I know who have pursued careers in male dominated academic fields.

	So I just wanna say that maybe Sabine herself is difficult, and certainly she alludes, perhaps without meaning to, to having done things that sabotaged her where maybe others just played the game and got further than she did as a result. But I also think there is something in her story that _is_ more universally applicable to women entering male-dominated fields in academia where tenured leaders have very little oversight.

	Nothing wrong with pursuing a PhD, it's fun, Noble, and puts you at some serious advantage in some job applications everywhere. Not that's it's the only factor, sure, but it can help a lot as a __differentiator Factor__. The real scam is in academia. Multiple factors like higher cost of living, a significant higher number of people pursuing PhDs, etc make an academic path not only impractical, but pointless. Postdoc hell is real and a lot of people (like that woman) waste some of their best years in it. Nevertheless, a PhD in STEM doesn't mean you only have academia as a real path, you can just work in industry, etc. Now, beware of academics telling you "nah it's fine" as a lot of them are either on denial because sunken costs fallacy, or are just masochistic people that never had thought that a less painful life is possible

	When you realise how hard it is to separate many people's perspectives from the underlying chance of their outcomes, is when you start tuning out the noise, and taking a good hard objective look at things.

	Is academia extremely competitive? Yes. But so is every other 'good job', or endeavour worth persevering in. If you love your field, then it's a risk you should be willing to take. If you don't make it, there's many other things you can do with a PhD, especially one in the sciences. The things we endure sharpen the people we are.

	First, we shouldn't draw conclusions based on a single data point, and that's what the video is: 1 data point.

	That said, I think everyone in academia has seen at least some of what she has described. I've seen her description of the textbook process first hand in computer science. So I can't describe what she has seen as anomolous.

	I guess my advise would be "What do you think will happen if you do not follow your current plan? What do you think will happen if you do follow your plan? Which is better?".

	Sabine is someone who I thought had some really great points when I was in undergrad. Read her book and everything. But a few years into grad school my opinion of her really soured (her opinions also got worse).

	Some of her YouTube videos are extremely misleading. I started feeling suspicious when she covered something in quantum computing and got some basic info wrong, and I pretty much lost all faith in her when she made a video trying to make particle physicists seem dumb for pursuing a particular hypothesis, but left out the main reason people actually have been interested in it. She ended the video saying something 'intimidated by physicists? Don't be.' after twisting the facts to portray experts in the field as irrational and frivolous. That and her NYT article reveal an anti science/anti expert bias that plays into a lot of populist rhetoric. Definitely keep that in mind when listening to her talk about science. She also has pretty unique career challenges given she's made it her thing to insult the entire field, sometimes in bad faith ways.

	I find her case really sad because I think she originally had some really insightful thoughts about science and epistemology, but ironically it feels like she lost her objectivity somewhere in the process.
