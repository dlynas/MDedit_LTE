"And I would put the question to you. Do you support the dismantling of Hamas?
So, let's take a simple case. About 1400 people, according to Israeli figures, about 1400 people were killed on October 7th.
Of those about 350 were soldiers. If you look at the figures for, let's say, Operation Cast-Lead.
It's about the same. 1400 people killed in Operation Cast-Lead, about a quarter of them, Hamas militants. It's roughly the same.
So, if you're of the opinion that because of what Hamas did on October 7th, it has to be destroyed. Not just this mantle, it has to be destroyed.
That, by the way, is Bernie Sanders' position. I acknowledge you that. Then, by that reasoning, the Israeli government has to be dismantled and destroyed.
Now, that's just one massacre. See, that's just one. Because Israel likes to periodically mold the lawn.
In Operation...
What's your good answer to the question?
Okay, I'm answering the question. I'm saying if Hamas has to be dismantled because of what it did in October 7th, then if you take Operation Cast-Lead, Operation Pillar of Defense, Operation Protective Edge, then the Israeli government has to be dismantled 10 times.
I follow you, but it's not really an answer to the question.
Oh, it is an answer to the question. It's called Keeping a Single Standard.
No, it's not.
You want to talk about the 290 Israeli hostages? I say fine. But then let's talk about the 2,300,000.
That's what I'm asking.
Oh, yes. Hamas is closing the gates. If you wanted to decide that Hamas has to be dismantled because of what it did on October 7th, I say fine.
But then the Israeli government has to also be dismantled because for 20 years, it's kept the whole population confined in a concentration.
I don't know if that's it.
I get you.

I periodically mold the lawn.
The comedy may be your forte, but the suffering of humanity has been what I've been about since I came onto this earth.
No, let me. And I am not...
Are you going to let me answer?"
