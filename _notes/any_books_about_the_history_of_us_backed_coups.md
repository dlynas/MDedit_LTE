## Any books about the history of U.S. backed Coups?

> Recently became interested in this topic after learning just how extensive it is. I checked the reading list under U.S. history but didn’t really find anything that was what i was looking for, at least at first glance, was hoping someone could give me a recommendation. hopefully something that is both comprehensive and easy to understand for a layman. thank you!

	"The Jakarta Method" by VIncent Bevins is a great start.  There have been several books about the birth/early years of the CIA that are good too, I quite enjoyed "The Quiet Americans" by Scott Anderson, and it introduces many of the major characters who crop up again and again.  "In Search of Enemies" by John Stockwell is a first hand account of the CIA in Africa; it is not exhaustive or great, but it is first hand, written at the time.

	"White Malice" by Susan Williams is a pretty exhaustive work about the rise and destruction of Patrice Lumumba.  Not an entirely US production, but a very early and well researched example.

	The National Security Archive ([https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/)) is invaluable, because it has declassified documents.  Their sections on Iran and Afghanistan are tremendous.
