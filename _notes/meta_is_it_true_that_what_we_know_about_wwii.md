## [Meta] Is it true that what we know about WWII Pacific War was mostly written by western historians who don't speak Japanese and rarely confront western understanding against Japanese sources? How big of a problem this is in other fields of history?

	Access to sources is always critical! In the case of World War II and the Eastern Front, the biggest issue was the inability for western scholars to access Soviet archives, so there was a marked dearth of good primary source documents for those writing on the topic. Tied up with a few other factors the end result was that there was *heavy* influence instead of German sources on understanding of the war up until the end of the Cold War. [This is expanded on and fleshed out considerably in this longer answer by myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bytjch/how_much_history_is_the_english_speaking_world/eqmsxb2/), as well as [this complementary answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bytjch/how_much_history_is_the_english_speaking_world/eqnsmst/) in the same thread from /[u/kochevnik81](https://www.reddit.com/user/kochevnik81) which looks at Soviet history outside of the WW2 context.

	As is discussed by [u/restricteddata](https://www.reddit.com/user/restricteddata) and several others in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/viijpz/how_do_historians_find_people_to_translate/), scholars are indeed expected to learn the relevant languages for their subject-matter. For example professional Classicists are generally required to have reading skills in Greek and Latin (the main language or our sources) and English, French, and German (the main languages of scholarship on the subject); I'm not quite there myself.

	"How much of a problem this is in other fields of study? Can you be a historian from Argentina writing about Dutch East India Company in Indonesia without speaking Dutch, or Indonesian for that matter? As a casual history "consumer" how can I hedge against it? How to find THE REAL ONES‚Ñ¢, the ones that would explain that modern Dutch has probably nothing to do with 17th century one and definitely there was no such thing as "Indonesian language" in that time."

	So as a scholar who studies 17th century East Asia I can give insight to this part of the question. 

	As a general rule, you need to know the languages that the relevant source material is in. If you want to study, the VOC in Indonesia to any serious degree, you need to learn Dutch, because all the source material is in Dutch. 

	As for Indonesian? As you note, the modern Indonesian language was not actually used for written sources. Written material from the Indonesian side in the 17th century would be in a variety of local languages, chiefly Malay and Javanese, at least for the most key polities on Java. But ofr instance, the Sultanate of Gowa on Sulawesi had their royal chronicles in Makassarese, with a completely different script. (WHile Javanese and Malay speaking areas would generally use an Arabic script after the conversion to Islam)

	The source material in the INdonesian languages are much more limited than the Dutch unfortunately, and the records are scattered across different scripts and languages. Ideally of course, the perfect historian can read them all and create the greatest book ever known. In practice, there are limits to what is reasonable to learn, and there is a very real sense of "law of diminishing returns" in learning entire, very difficult langauges and scripts to engage with a small amount of source material. Students of Indian history also suffer from this problem. 

	THe result is that most scholars of 17th century Indonesia tend to focus on the European material, or limit themselves to learning only one language - often Malay or Javanese. (Notably, the above-mentioned Macassar has an entire historiography of itself, quite separate from wider Indonesian studies.

	These days, many of the key sources in Asian langauges are translated into Dutch or English however, so you can get quite far without knowing them, and indeed, a great deal of the recent research on Indonesia are done by people with only a passing knowledge of the Indonesian languages. And many of them are quite good. 

	Personally, I mostly engage with European source material; written in English, Danish, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese, and then mostly with translations of material in Asian languages - it gets you far enough.
