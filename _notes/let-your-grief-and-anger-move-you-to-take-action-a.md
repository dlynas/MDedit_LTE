## let your grief and anger move you to take action. another world is possible. we must all do our part.

“We are not powerless. We all have it in our
grasp to do something. Whenever you feel like there’s nothing you can do, there is always something.” - @toni.creations 

“It can be overwhelming to witness/ experience/ take in all the injustices of the moment; the good news is that *they’re all connected.* So if your little corner of work involves pulling at one of the threads, you’re helping to unravel the whole damn cloth.” - @/jwillia2 on X

“To refuse to participate in the shaping our future is to give it up. Do not be misled into passivity either by false security (they don’t mean me) or by despair (there’s nothing we can do). Each of us must find our work and do it.” - Audre Lorde

“Instead of thinking, “I can’t make a change,” ask yourself, what if? What if you showing up creates a ripple that becomes unstoppable? What if you are part of a missing piece that would help form a massive wave? What if?” - @iamjulietdiaz
