**Cooperative bargaining** is a process in which two people decide how to share a surplus that they can jointly generate. In many cases, the surplus created by the two players can be shared in many ways, forcing the players to negotiate which division of payoffs to choose. Such surplus-sharing problems (also called **bargaining problem**) are faced by management and labor in the division of a firm's profit, by trade partners in the specification of the terms of trade, and more.

The present article focuses on the _normative_ approach to bargaining. It studies how the surplus _should_ be shared, by formulating appealing axioms that the solution to a bargaining problem should satisfy. It is useful when both parties are willing to cooperate in implementing the fair solution. Such solutions, particularly the Nash solution, were used to solve concrete economic problems, such as management–labor conflicts, on numerous occasions.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

An alternative approach to bargaining is the _positive_ approach. It studies how the surplus is actually shared. Under the positive approach, the bargaining procedure is modeled as a non-cooperative game. The most common form of such game is called _[sequential bargaining](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_bargaining "Sequential bargaining")_.

## Formal description [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Formal description")

A two-person bargain problem consists of:

The problem is nontrivial if agreements in ![{\displaystyle F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57) are better for both parties than the disagreement point. A solution to the bargaining problem selects an agreement ![{\displaystyle \phi }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/72b1f30316670aee6270a28334bdf4f5072cdde4) in ![{\displaystyle F}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57).

### Feasibility set [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Feasibility set")

The feasible agreements typically include all possible joint actions, leading to a feasibility set that includes all possible payoffs. Often, the feasible set is restricted to include only payoffs that have a possibility of being better than the disagreement point for both agents.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup>

### Disagreement point [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Disagreement point")

The disagreement point ![{\displaystyle d}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e85ff03cbe0c7341af6b982e47e9f90d235c66ab) is the value the players can expect to receive if negotiations break down. This could be some [focal equilibrium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory) "Focal point (game theory)") that both players could expect to play. This point directly affects the bargaining solution, however, so it stands to reason that each player should attempt to choose his disagreement point in order to maximize his bargaining position. Towards this objective, it is often advantageous to increase one's own disagreement payoff while harming the opponent's disagreement payoff (hence the interpretation of the disagreement as a threat). If threats are viewed as actions, then one can construct a separate game wherein each player chooses a threat and receives a payoff according to the outcome of bargaining. It is known as _Nash's variable threat game_.

## Nash bargaining game [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Nash bargaining game")

[John Forbes Nash](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr. "John Forbes Nash Jr.") was the first to study cooperative bargaining. His solution is called the [Nash bargaining solution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#Nash_bargaining_solution). It is the unique solution to a two-person bargaining problem that satisfies the axioms of _scale invariance_, _symmetry_, _efficiency_, and _independence of irrelevant alternatives_. According to Walker,<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Nash's bargaining solution was shown by [John Harsanyi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harsanyi "John Harsanyi") to be the same as [Zeuthen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeuthen_Strategy "Zeuthen Strategy")'s solution<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> of the bargaining problem.

The Nash bargaining game is a simple two-player game used to model bargaining interactions. In the Nash bargaining game, two players demand a portion of some good (usually some amount of money). If the total amount requested by the players is less than that available, both players get their request. If their total request is greater than that available, neither player gets their request.

Nash (1953) presents a non-cooperative demand game with two players who are uncertain about which payoff pairs are feasible. In the limit as the uncertainty vanishes, equilibrium payoffs converge to those predicted by the Nash bargaining solution.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_2-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Equilibrium analysis [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Equilibrium analysis")

Strategies are represented in the Nash demand game by a pair (_x_, _y_). _x_ and _y_ are selected from the [interval](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics) "Interval (mathematics)") \[_d_, _z_\], where _d_ is the disagreement outcome and _z_ is the total amount of good. If _x_ + _y_ is equal to or less than _z_, the first player receives _x_ and the second _y_. Otherwise both get _d_; often  .

There are many [Nash equilibria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibria "Nash equilibria") in the Nash demand game. Any _x_ and _y_ such that _x_ + _y_ = _z_ is a Nash equilibrium. If either player increases their demand, both players receive nothing. If either reduces their demand they will receive less than if they had demanded _x_ or _y_. There is also a Nash equilibrium where both players demand the entire good. Here both players receive nothing, but neither player can increase their return by unilaterally changing their strategy.

In Rubinstein's alternating offers bargaining game,<sup id="cite_ref-Rubinstein_97–109_5-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-Rubinstein_97%E2%80%93109-5">[5]</a></sup> players take turns acting as the proposer for splitting some surplus. The division of the surplus in the unique subgame perfect equilibrium depends upon how strongly players prefer current over future payoffs. In particular, let d be the discount factor, which refers to the rate at which players discount future earnings. That is, after each step the surplus is worth d times what it was worth previously. Rubinstein showed that if the surplus is normalized to 1, the payoff for player 1 in equilibrium is 1/(1+d), while the payoff for player 2 is d/(1+d). In the limit as players become perfectly patient, the equilibrium division converges to the Nash bargaining solution.

## Bargaining solutions [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Bargaining solutions")

Various solutions have been proposed based on slightly different assumptions about what properties are desired for the final agreement point.

### Nash bargaining solution [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Nash bargaining solution")

[John Forbes Nash Jr.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr. "John Forbes Nash Jr.") proposed<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> that a solution should satisfy certain axioms:

1.  Invariant to affine transformations or Invariant to equivalent utility representations
2.  [Pareto optimality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_optimality "Pareto optimality")
3.  [Independence of irrelevant alternatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives "Independence of irrelevant alternatives")
4.  [Symmetry](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry "Symmetry")

Nash proved that the solutions satisfying these axioms are exactly the points   in   which maximize the following expression:

where _u_ and _v_ are the utility functions of Player 1 and Player 2, respectively, and d is a disagreement outcome. That is, players act as if they seek to maximize  , where   and  , are the [status quo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo "Status quo") utilities (the utility obtained if one decides not to bargain with the other player). The product of the two excess utilities is generally referred to as the _Nash product_. Intuitively, the solution consists of each player getting their status quo payoff (i.e., noncooperative payoff) in addition to a share of the benefits occurring from cooperation.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 15–16">: 15–16 </span></sup> 

### Kalai–Smorodinsky bargaining solution [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Kalai–Smorodinsky bargaining solution")

[Independence of irrelevant alternatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives "Independence of irrelevant alternatives") can be substituted with a [resource monotonicity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_monotonicity "Resource monotonicity") axiom. This was demonstrated by [Ehud Kalai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Kalai "Ehud Kalai") and Meir Smorodinsky.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> This leads to the so-called _Kalai–Smorodinsky bargaining solution_: it is the point which maintains the ratios of maximal gains. In other words, if we normalize the disagreement point to (0,0) and player 1 can receive a maximum of   with player 2's help (and vice versa for  ), then the Kalai–Smorodinsky bargaining solution would yield the point   on the Pareto frontier such that   .

### Egalitarian bargaining solution [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Egalitarian bargaining solution")

The egalitarian bargaining solution, introduced by Ehud Kalai,<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> is a third solution which drops the condition of scale invariance while including both the axiom of [independence of irrelevant alternatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives "Independence of irrelevant alternatives"), and the axiom of [resource monotonicity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_monotonicity "Resource monotonicity"). It is the solution which attempts to grant equal gain to both parties. In other words, it is the point which maximizes the minimum payoff among players.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2024)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Kalai notes that this solution is closely related to the [egalitarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarian "Egalitarian") ideas of [John Rawls](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls "John Rawls").

### Comparison table [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Comparison table")

| Name | Pareto-optimality | Symmetry | Scale-invariance | Irrelevant-independence | Resource-monotonicity | Principle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nash (1950) |   |   |   |   |   | Maximizing the _product_ of surplus utilities |
| Kalai-Smorodinsky (1975) |   |   |   |   |   | Equalizing the ratios of maximal gains |
| Kalai (1977) |   |   |   |   |   | Maximizing the _minimum_ of surplus utilities |

## Experimental solutions [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Experimental solutions")

A series of experimental studies<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> found no consistent support for any of the bargaining models. Although some participants reached results similar to those of the models, others did not, focusing instead on conceptually easy solutions beneficial to both parties. The Nash equilibrium was the most common agreement (mode), but the average (mean) agreement was closer to a point based on expected utility.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> In real-world negotiations, participants often first search for a general bargaining formula, and then only work out the details of such an arrangement, thus precluding the disagreement point and instead moving the focal point to the worst possible agreement.

## Applications [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Applications")

[Kenneth Binmore](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Binmore "Kenneth Binmore") has used the Nash bargaining game to explain the emergence of human attitudes toward [distributive justice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_justice "Distributive justice").<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> He primarily uses [evolutionary game theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory "Evolutionary game theory") to explain how individuals come to believe that proposing a 50–50 split is the only [just](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice "Justice") solution to the Nash bargaining game. [Herbert Gintis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Gintis "Herbert Gintis") supports a similar theory, holding that humans have evolved to a predisposition for [strong reciprocity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_reciprocity "Strong reciprocity") but do not necessarily make decisions based on direct consideration of utility.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

## Bargaining solutions and risk-aversion [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cooperative_bargaining&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Bargaining solutions and risk-aversion")

Some economists have studied the effects of [risk aversion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion "Risk aversion") on the bargaining solution. Compare two similar bargaining problems A and B, where the feasible space and the utility of player 1 remain fixed, but the utility of player 2 is different: player 2 is more risk-averse in A than in B. Then, the payoff of player 2 in the Nash bargaining solution is smaller in A than in B.<sup id="cite_ref-OR94_15-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-OR94-15">[15]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 303–304">: 303–304 </span></sup>  However, this is true only if the outcome itself is certain; if the outcome is risky, then a risk-averse player may get a better deal as proved by [Alvin E. Roth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_E._Roth "Alvin E. Roth") and [Uriel Rothblum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriel_Rothblum "Uriel Rothblum")<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
