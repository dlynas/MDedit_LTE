"What do you do with a hyper arrogant, hyper violent state that you cannot control?
And even if you vote by now, you're going to get another form.
This is when I was doing research on Cobb's cities and I'll say, and I know they're
their culture, but this would blew my mind, right?
Because I was so from the, you know, from the South, it's especially for my mother, like
my father was bougie.
He grew up that way with money, but she wasn't.
And so civil rights was everything for her.
He was like doing the research and like at the same time that President Lyndon Bain Johnson,
another Texan, was signing the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, handing the pen
on to King.
He was also green lighting mercenaries assassinating Black intellectuals in Africa to support the
Empire.
Obviously, you get, that's a, that's a weird coin to flip.
So we celebrate our civil rights in the United States, but we don't ask what the US is doing
in other countries, right?
And in a way, I think we got captured.
We obviously want to be safe.
Nobody wants, you know, a lot of us have families like, oh, remember that lynchied and
great, great, whatever.
Like we have these narratives, right?
We want to integrate in order to be safe and we want to be productive.
But what we're integrating into just becomes another trojan horse, but with the black face.
Think of it, the two people who vetoed the ceasefire in Palestine, one was Linda, Linda,
Linda, Thomas Greenfield, and then her head attached shade, both her African American.
And Lloyd Austin, and I hope he's, you know, he's in and out of the hospital, so something's
going on.
I hope he, you know, he heals whatever.
But he's a job really, as it was another black person first.
Clared's Thomas is just really weird, so I don't even want to cite it.
But there's, there's this way that black faces are becoming the poster face of US Empire.
That will never be a good look for us.
And we're so splintered because the prize was to get in.
The prize was not Maranage.
I mean, I know radicals who are like committed to Maranage and they're like, they can have that.
I'm not going near it.
But for the majority of us, we were raised.
This is where I teach, why I teach where I teach, right?
And so I don't want to make it like, oh, you have to do more therapy.
I would rather we had a strategic plan and that we could discipline, you mentioned discipline
earlier, Connor, that we could discipline ourselves no matter how uncomfortable it becomes
to stick with the plan.
