**William Irwin Thompson** (July 16, 1938 – November 8, 2020) was an American [social philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_philosophy "Social philosophy"), [cultural critic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_criticism "Cultural criticism"), and poet. He received the [Oslo International Poetry Festival Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_International_Poetry_Festival "Oslo International Poetry Festival") in 1986. He described his writing and speaking style as "mind-jazz on ancient texts". He was the founder of the [Lindisfarne Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne_Association "Lindisfarne Association"), which proposed the study and realization of a new planetary culture.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Biography\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Irwin_Thompson&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")\]

Thompson was born on July 16, 1938<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> in [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago"), Illinois, and grew up in [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles"), California. Thompson received his B.A. at [Pomona College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomona_College "Pomona College") and his Ph.D. at [Cornell University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University "Cornell University"). He was a professor of [humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities "Humanities") at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") and then at [York University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_University "York University") in [Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto "Toronto"), Ontario. He has held visiting appointments at [Syracuse University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_University "Syracuse University") (in 1973 - where he taught "Resacralization and the Emergence of a Planetary Culture"), the [University of Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hawaii "University of Hawaii"), the [University of Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Toronto "University of Toronto") and the [California Institute of Integral Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Integral_Studies "California Institute of Integral Studies") (1992).

In 1973, he left academia to found the [Lindisfarne Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne_Association "Lindisfarne Association"). The Association, which he led from 1972 to 2012, was a group of scientists, poets, and religious scholars who met in order to discuss and to participate in the emerging planetary culture.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Thompson lived in Switzerland for 17 years. He describes a recent work, _Canticum Turicum_ in his 2009 book, _Still Travels: Three Long Poems_, as "a long poem on [Western Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture "Western culture") that begins with [folktales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore "Folklore") and traces of [Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne "Charlemagne") in [Zürich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich "Zürich") and ends with the completion of Western Civilization as expressed in _[Finnegans Wake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake "Finnegans Wake")_ and the traces of [James Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce "James Joyce") in Zürich."

Thompson was a Founding Mentor to the private [K-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E2%80%9312_education "K–12 education") [Ross School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_School_(East_Hampton,_New_York) "Ross School (East Hampton, New York)") in [East Hampton, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Hampton_(village),_New_York "East Hampton (village), New York"). In 1995, with mathematician [Ralph Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Abraham_(mathematician) "Ralph Abraham (mathematician)"), he designed a new type of cultural history curriculum based on their theories about the evolution of consciousness.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> Thompson lived his retired years in Portland, Maine.

## Work\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Irwin_Thompson&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Work")\]

Thompson did his Master's Essay at Cornell on applying the [process philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy "Process philosophy") of [Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead "Alfred North Whitehead") to poetry; he did his doctoral dissertation on the Easter Rising in Dublin 1916. While serving on the faculty at MIT in the 1960s, Thompson met famed [media ecologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_ecology "Media ecology") Marshall McLuhan, who would influence Thompson's writings on cultural history. Thompson engages a diverse set of traditions, including the Swiss cultural historian [Jean Gebser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Gebser "Jean Gebser"), the Vedic philosopher [Sri Aurobindo Ghose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Aurobindo_Ghose "Sri Aurobindo Ghose"), the [autopoetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis "Autopoiesis") [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology "Epistemology") of [Francisco Varela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Varela "Francisco Varela"), the [endosymbiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiotic "Endosymbiotic") theory of evolution of [Lynn Margulis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Margulis "Lynn Margulis"), the [Gaia Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_Theory "Gaia Theory") of [James Lovelock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lovelock "James Lovelock"), the [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems "Complex systems") thought of [Ralph Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Abraham_(mathematician) "Ralph Abraham (mathematician)"), the novels of [Thomas Pynchon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon "Thomas Pynchon"), and the daimonic transmissions of mystic [David Spangler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Spangler "David Spangler").

### Style\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Irwin_Thompson&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Style")\]

_Performance_ is central to Thompson's approach. Performances either open new horizons for the future or close them down, and should be judged on that basis. Thompson thought that with the emergence of the integral era and its electronic media expressions that a new mode of discourse was required. He sought "to turn non-fiction into a work of art on its own terms. Rather than trying to be a scholar or a journalist writing on the political and cultural news of the day, I worked to become a poetic reporter on the evolutionary news of the epoch".<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> He espoused the notion that one must express an integral approach not just in content but in the very means of expressing it. Thompson did this in the way he approached teaching: "The traditional academic lecture also became for me an occasion to transform the genre, to present not an academic reading of a paper, but a form of Bardic performance–not stories of battles but of the new ideas that were emerging around the world...The course was meant to be a performance of the very reality it sought to describe".<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

"_Wissenskunst_" (literally, "knowledge-art") is a German term that Thompson coined to describe his own work. Contrasting it with _Wissenschaft_, the German term for science, Thompson defines _Wissenskunst_ as "the play of knowledge in a world of serious data-processors."

> As fiction and music are coming closer to reorganizing knowledge, scholarship is becoming closer to art. Our culture is changing, and so the [genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre "Genre") of literature and history are changing as well. In an agricultural-warrior society, the genre is the [epic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry "Epic poetry"), an _[Iliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad "Iliad")_. In an industrial-bourgeois society, the genre is the novel, a _[Moll Flanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moll_Flanders "Moll Flanders")_. In our electronic, [cybernetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetic "Cybernetic") society, the genre is _Wissenkunst_: the play of knowledge in a world of serious data-processors. The scholarly fictions of [Jorge Luis Borges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges "Jorge Luis Borges"), or the reviews of [non-existent books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_book "Fictional book") by [Stanisław Lem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem "Stanisław Lem"), are examples of new art forms of a society in which humanity live, not innocently in nature nor confidently in cities, but [apocalyptically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypticism "Apocalypticism") in a civilization cracking up to the universe. At such a moment as this the novelist becomes a [prophet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet "Prophet"), the composer a [magician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion) "Magic (illusion)"), and the historian a [bard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard "Bard"), a voice recalling ancient identities.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

### Works\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Irwin_Thompson&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Works")\]

#### _The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Irwin_Thompson&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light")\]

In his acclaimed 1981 work _The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light: Mythology, Sexuality and the Origins of Culture_, Thompson criticized what he considers the [hubristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris "Hubris") pretensions of [E. O. Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson "E. O. Wilson")'s [sociobiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociobiology "Sociobiology"), which attempted to subsume the [humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities "Humanities") to [evolutionary biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology "Evolutionary biology").<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Thompson then reviewed and critiqued the scholarship on the emergence of civilization from the [Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic "Paleolithic") to the historical period. He analyzed the assumptions and prejudices of the various anthropologists and historians who have written on the subject, and attempted to paint a more balanced picture. He described the task of the historian as closer to that of the artist and poet than to that of the scientist.

> Because we have separated humanity from nature, subject from object, values from analysis, knowledge from myth, and universities from the universe, it is enormously difficult for anyone but a poet or a mystic to understand what is going on in the holistic and mythopoeic thought of Ice Age humanity. The very language we use to discuss the past speaks of tools, hunters, and _men_, when every statue and painting we discover cries out to us that this Ice Age humanity was a culture of art, the love of animals, and women.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

Thompson sees the [Stone Age religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_religion "Paleolithic religion") expressed in the [Venus figurines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_figurine "Venus figurine"), [Lascaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux "Lascaux") [cave paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting "Cave painting"), [Çatal Hüyük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk "Çatalhöyük"), and [other artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-historic_art "Pre-historic art") to be an early form of [shamanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanism "Shamanism"). He believes that as humanity spread across the globe and was divided into separate cultures, this universal shamanistic [Mother Goddess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Goddess "Mother Goddess") religion became the various [esoteric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esotericism "Esotericism") traditions and [religions of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_religious_groups "Major religious groups"). Using this model, he analyzed [Egyptian mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_mythology "Egyptian mythology"), [Sumerian hymns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamian_mythology "Mesopotamian mythology"), the _[Epic of Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh "Epic of Gilgamesh")_, the cult of [Quetzalcoatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetzalcoatl "Quetzalcoatl"), and many other stories, myths, and traditions. Thompson often refers to [Kriya yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriya_Yoga_school "Kriya Yoga school") and [Yoga Nidra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Nidra "Yoga Nidra") throughout these analyses, and this seems to be the spiritual tradition with which he is most comfortable.

#### _Coming Into Being_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Irwin_Thompson&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Coming Into Being")\]

In his 1996 work _Coming into Being: Artifacts and Texts in the Evolution of Consciousness_, Thompson applied an approach that was similar to his 1981 book to many other artifacts, cultures and historical periods. A notable difference, however, is that the 1996 work was influenced by the work of cultural [phenomenologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy) "Phenomenology (philosophy)") [Jean Gebser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Gebser "Jean Gebser"). Works and authors analyzed include the _[Enuma Elish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enuma_Elish "Enuma Elish")_, [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer "Homer"), [Hesiod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod "Hesiod"), [Sappho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sappho "Sappho"), the _[Book of Judges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Judges "Book of Judges")_, the _[Rig Veda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rig_Veda "Rig Veda")_, _[Ramayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana "Ramayana")_, _[Upanishads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads "Upanishads")_, _[Bhagavad Gita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita "Bhagavad Gita")_, and the _[Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching "Tao Te Ching")_. Thompson analyzed these works using the vocabulary of contemporary cognitive theory and [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory"), as well as theories of history. An expanded paperback version was released in 1998.

The phrase "Coming into being" is a translation of the Greek term _gignesthai_, from which the word _[genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis "Book of Genesis")_ is derived.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

#### _Self and Society_\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Irwin_Thompson&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Self and Society")\]

In his 2004 book _Self and Society: Studies in the Evolution of Consciousness_, and in collaboration with the mathematician [Ralph Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Abraham_(mathematician) "Ralph Abraham (mathematician)"), Thompson related Gebser's structures to periods in the [development of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_mathematics "History of mathematics") ([arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic"), [geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric "Geometric"), [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra "Algebra"), [dynamical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical "Dynamical"), chaotic) and in the [history of music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_music "History of music").

### Interests\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Irwin_Thompson&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Interests")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Fullsizeoutput_56b.jpg/300px-Fullsizeoutput_56b.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fullsizeoutput_56b.jpg)

The Lindisfarne Fellows House in [Crestone, Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crestone,_Colorado "Crestone, Colorado")

Thompson considers [James Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce "James Joyce")'s stylistically experimental novel _[Finnegans Wake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake "Finnegans Wake")_ to be "the ultimate novel, indeed, the ultimate book," and also to be the climactic artistic work of the modern period and of the rational mentality. Thompson is fascinated by [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles"), where he grew up, and [Disneyland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland_Park_(Anaheim) "Disneyland Park (Anaheim)"), which he considers to be LA's [essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence "Essence"). He has also written a book-length treatment of the [Easter Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Rising "Easter Rising") of 1916.

Thompson has critiqued [postmodern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism "Postmodernism") [literary criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_criticism "Literary criticism"), [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"), the technological [futurism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_studies "Futures studies") of [Raymond Kurzweil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Kurzweil "Raymond Kurzweil"), the contemporary [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind "Philosophy of mind") theories of [Daniel Dennett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett "Daniel Dennett") and [Paul Churchland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Churchland "Paul Churchland"), and the [astrobiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrobiology "Astrobiology") [cosmogony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony "Cosmogony") of [Zecharia Sitchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zecharia_Sitchin "Zecharia Sitchin").

### Reception\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Irwin_Thompson&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Reception")\]

Thompson's second book, _At the Edge of History_ was reviewed in _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_ by [Christopher Lehmann-Haupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lehmann-Haupt "Christopher Lehmann-Haupt") in March 1971.<sup id="cite_ref-haupt_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-haupt-12">[12]</a></sup>

Thompson's 1974 _Passages About Earth_ was reviewed in _[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")_. The reviewer wrote:

> From ample but largely gloomy evidence of rapid [social change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change "Social change") — [future shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_shock "Future shock"), [ecological disruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_crisis "Ecological crisis"), [population explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_explosion "Population explosion"), [proliferation of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution "Digital Revolution") — Thompson draws a startling conclusion: "We are the climactic generation of human [cultural evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_evolution "Cultural evolution")." Man, he asserts, will now either slide back into a new Dark Age or evolve into a higher, more spiritual being.

> Which way will we go? The author opts for evolution. While such optimism is as welcome as it is rare these days, it is largely based on mysticism and intimations of a "new planetary culture," which Thompson shares with Philosopher [Teilhard de Chardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin "Pierre Teilhard de Chardin") and Science-Fiction Writer [Arthur C. Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke "Arthur C. Clarke"). This is thin [epistemological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemological "Epistemological") ice even for a skater as fast as Thompson. Indeed, incredulous readers may drop the book after the first reference to "our lost cosmological orientation." That would be a mistake. Agree with it or not, Passages is always fascinating, a [magical mystery tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_mystery_tour "Magical mystery tour") of man's potential.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

Thompson's 1981 book _The Time Falling Bodies Take To Light: Mythology, Sexuality, and the Origins of Culture_ was reviewed in the _[New York Times Book Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Book_Review "New York Times Book Review")_ by [Christopher Lehmann-Haupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Lehmann-Haupt "Christopher Lehmann-Haupt"). Lehmann-Haupt concluded:

> In _The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light,_ William Irwin Thompson has gone part of the way toward rescuing mysticism from its Western friends. But only part of the way.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Irwin_Thompson#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
