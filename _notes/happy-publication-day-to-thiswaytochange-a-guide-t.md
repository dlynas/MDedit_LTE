## ☁️✿ Happy publication day to #THISWAYTOCHANGE, a guide to changing yourself to change the world ✿☁️

This book was born from dreams. Literal dreams I had (see page 24 “DREAMING OF BILLIE”), visions that came to me during meditations, and wishes I willed into my life. 

I never go anywhere without a notebook and it’s because poems come to me on trains, at parties, while I’m watching a movie or show, sometimes even in the midst of a conversation. In neurodivergent language, this book is a bunch of pebbles I collected over the course of 3 years. I wrote the book I wanted to read 🥹

I really dreamed this into reality. Not just this book, but the life and person and process that made this book possible.

My literary debut is now available anywhere books are sold. I hope for this book to reach who it’s meant to reach. Stay tuned for more tour dates, get in touch if you want to bring me somewhere, and leave reviews at places like GoodReads and online bookshops— it truly helps the book’s direction and trajectory! 
To celebrate, I’d love to hear from you— what are you dreaming of lately? Or if you’ve gotten the book already, let me know where you’re located ✌︎ ✿ ‿ ✿ ✌︎
