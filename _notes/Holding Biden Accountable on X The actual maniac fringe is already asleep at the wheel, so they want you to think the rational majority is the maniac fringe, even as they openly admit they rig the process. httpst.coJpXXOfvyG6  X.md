The actual maniac fringe is already asleep at the wheel, so they want you to think the rational majority is the maniac fringe, even as they openly admit they rig the process.



What if and get this..... The 12 percent are the fringe and the almost 90 percent are the majority. Have the pundits considered that?

What a surprise, just like MAGA and other far right extremists who claim to represent the views of "the people", lefties have always claimed that like 99% of Americans love all their ideas, but their undying support just never shows up at the ballot box. Weird! Curious! Sad!
