In the spring of 1985 we padlocked the front doors of Hamilton Hall, renaming it Mandela Hall, and encamped on the steps for three weeks. Columbia divested from South Africa in the fall of 1985.

I don’t know how much US student protesters are aware: York University in the UK is divesting from Israel-linked arms companies as a result of student movement. Protest works!

This is such amazing news. The university where I work ⁦@UniOfYork⁩ divests from Israel-linked arms companies. I hope soon other universities will follow the same path  newarab.com/news/uk-univer

We are carrying that spirit with us tonight. !



now it's Hind Hall, after Hind... well done

International governmental sanctions against South Africa were proposed and began under the aegis of the UN in 1962, joined by major corporations and other global forced some 23 years before Columbia students took over a school building, so don’t take too much credit.

doesn't look like you can step in the same river twice.

How’s South Africa doing these days?

But apartheid was wrong. This time Hamas is wrong as are their supporters.

So proud of you all! 

Imagine thinking this is anything like that and that Israel is an apartheid state like South Africa was. Shameful.

And now it is a trash heap.

you're awesome, thank you, hopefully we can stop a genocide today, we need everyone to do it though

In this case, what happens if Columbia divests from companies that support Israel, and how would you know?

In 1968, Columbia students occupied Hamilton Hall. Vietnam ended seven years later.

Why do Hamilton Hall protests matter Symbolic Historical significance
