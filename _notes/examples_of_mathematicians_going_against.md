	The insolubility of the quintic. For centuries people sought a formula to find the roots of polynomials of degrees higher than 4 that used only arithmetic operations and extracting roots.

	They sought in vain for a long time. Until Abel and Galois independently proved such a formula did not exist, using what we now call Galois theory. To be able to do so, they needed to first have the insight that what everyone sought to do was impossible--which went against the conventional wisdom.

	Fourier analysis is another example. Fourier's memoir on the heat equation was poorly understood at the time. Analysts were used to Taylor series expansions of analytic functions. Such expansions are much easier to deal with, because of the uniform convergence in a neighborhood of the center of the series.

	This is not true of Fourier series, which exhibit behavior like Gibbs phenomena that reflect the fact that periodic functions can have more complicated discontinuities than analytic functions (where discontinuities arise only at poles/essential singularities). Indeed the quest to determine which functions *have* a Fourier series, and to define in which sense a Fourier series converges, eventually spurred the development of Lebesgue integration.

	Grothendieck steps onto the scene saying, “y’all are studying very specific rings… namely quotients of polynomial rings. But what if we took your theory and flipped it, and studied the properties you’re interested in but applied to all rings?”

	Split the field of algebraic geometry into “classical” vs “modern”.

			Sure! Following the tradition of the Italian school of algebraic geometry, Oscar Zariski (and others) normalized the idea of studying algebraic varieties (vanishing loci of finitely many algebraic equations) by appealing to commutative algebra. Specifically, he insisted we reference the quotients of polynomial rings by the ideals corresponding to the relevant equations. This led to correspondence between algebraic varieties and specific rings, and brought to the field a level of rigor that had been lacking in the field up until that point. 
			
			Decades later, Alexander Grothendieck took a look at the state of affairs, and realized that the algebra we were doing could apply not just to quotients of polynomial rings, but really to all rings! And the geometric object that arises from expanding our horizons to include all rings is what we call a *scheme*, and it remains to this day one of the central objects of study in algebraic geometry.

				I just needed it in a problem in Fourier analysis, where I needed to exchange limit and integration for functions for which the dominated convergence theorem doesn't hold, so I can do Fourier Transform of functions that are not in L(1) or L(2) and thus would lead to infinity everywhere when FT is applied.

	Cantor who write theory to deal with actual infinity. This was met with suspicions. Ironic since people ended up being right to be suspicious of infinity, but we fixed that problem.

	Hilbert introduced non-constructive method into algebra. Ironic since the theorem he used it on can actually be proved constructively.

	Brouwer went the other way and insisted on restricting math to constructive method; an idea later followed up on by Heyting who developed intuitionistic logic. Ironic since his most famous theorem cannot be proved with constructive method.

	Clifford and Grassman developed new theory of multiplication of vectors (Clifford's geometric algebra and Grassman's exterior algebra)...and they were completely ignored, because physicists prefer Hamilton's quaternion which is later replaced by Gibbs's dot and cross product (which was derived from Hamilton's quaternion).

	Then, relativity and quantum physics happened, and Grassman and Clifford's theories turned out to be crucial.

		My knowledge of Geometric Algebra comes mostly from the small but devout following it has among 3D graphics enthusiasts^\*, but is it actually that different? 3D rotors are isomorphic to quaternions, and the whole trick of doing cross products in 3D relies on the fact that a 3D bivector has the same number of components as a 3D vector, so if you remember that the result of a cross product is actually a pseudovector that transforms weirdly sometimes, one can go throught their whole life without noticing that there's something fishy about the whole thing. Using GA in weird spaces to represent 3D points (like the 4,-1 conformal coordinates used in the book "Geometric Algebra for Computer Science" by Dorst, Fontijne, and Mann) is more interesting in my opinion, but then I don't know if it has any relation to how GA is used in physics.

			>so if you remember that the result of a cross product is actually a pseudovector that transforms weirdly sometimes, one can go throught their whole life without noticing that there's something fishy about the whole thing
			
			Cross product are already weird even in Newton's world. People noticed it, but they just brush it away with some hacks (like "pseudovector"). Even as a kid learning about cross product I noticed the problem: "why is there a physical quantity that depends on which hand I have? and how does it even make sense that you are equating a length with an area, which should have different unit of measurement?".
			
			People are used to just work with cross product and brushed the problems away with a few "hacks" like that. But the problems compound when you move to relativity and at that point you can't no longer ignore it. It's like how people are used to only use positive numbers and not have negative numbers, and instead just break everything into 2 cases; but the problem compound when you deal with problems that need too many cases.
			
			Geometric algebra (now called Clifford algebra) is used in relativistic quantum physics, because that's when you run into 2 problems at once: the need to have spinor, and the fact that you're on a 4D space.
			
			The name "geometric algebra" is now the name for a particular presentation of Clifford algebra, with new terminologies. The underlying theory is the same, but proponents believe that this version is easier to understand and should be taught to kids instead of the cross product, because it unifies vector algebra.

					Almost nothing you learn is original. Whatever you learned in math now are most likely follow a new presentations that was written in the last 50 years (unless you're actually a researcher).
					
					What I was distinguishing, is Clifford algebra, which is a theory and can be presented in many ways, and geometric algebra, which is a particular presentation of that theory. And the reason I'm distinguishing them is that the usual presentations of the theory of Clifford algebra will follow usual conventions and terminologies of either math or physics (depends on where you learn it from). But geometric algebra will have its own terminologies.

			It's really just a unifying perspective. Just like the quaternions are the even subalgebra of Cl(3,0,0), the complex numbers are the even subalgebra of Cl(2,0,0), and this is the reason both represent rotations. If you're interested in 3D graphics, you may have heard of the use of dual quaternions to unify linear and rotational motion---turns out these are the even subalgebra of Cl(3,0,1) (called PGA, "Plane-based Geometric Algebra" or "Projective Geometric Algebra), and this algebra turns out to be a natural setting to do flat Euclidean geometry.
			
			What all these algebras also do that more "traditional" approaches don't is represent geometric objects in a uniform way that's consistent with how the algebra represents motions/transformations. Cl(3,0,1) is my favorite example of this: the algebra gives distinct representations for all planes, lines, points (not just through the origin) as well as pure displacements and plane-orientations (also called free vectors and free planes). That is, unlike vector algebra where vectors are used to represent both points and displacements (and I have *definitely* seen this confuse people), in Cl(3,0,1) these are distinct algebraic objects with appropriate properties. The algebra of course allows us to combine all these objects in various geometric ways. The use of the full algebra and not just its even subalgebra is crucial in allowing this sort of setup.

					If you mean geometric/Clifford algebra in general, I would definitely start with *Geometric Algebra for Physicists* by Chris Doran and Anthony Lasenby. This starts with Euclidean geometric algebra in 3D and then moves into rigid body mechanics, nD non-degenerate geometric algebras, special relativity, calculus and pseudo-Riemannian geometry, the conformal model, quantum mechanics and Dirac theory, and general relativity.
					
					A must-read is *The Inner Products of Geometric Algebra* by Leo Dorst, preferably before you're even close to finishing Doran and Lasenby. This will greatly clarify and simplify the use of the "inner product" in geometric algebras.
					
					*Clifford Algebra and Spinors* by Pertti Lounesto is also a great introduction and well worth a read; instead of physics applications it has more mathematical details.
					
					You will most certainly see David Hestenes and Garret Sobczyk's *Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus* mentioned frequently on the physics/applied side of things. This book is a great reference but is impenetrable to read as a text due to brief arguments missing key steps mixed with typos and a bit of lack of rigour.
					
					I think the best place to start with PGA is [*May the Forque Be with You!*](https://bivector.net/PGADYN.html) by Leo Dorst and Steven De Keninck. This covers rigid body mechanics in PGA and can be seen as an extension of [screw theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_theory). However I have one erratum and two notes:
					
					  * When they introduce the bivector velocity, they denote it by B after having just used B for the bivector motor generator e^B, however these **are not** the same thing.
					  * They embed free vectors (i.e. displacements) as vectors in the algebra, but this is geometrically incorrect since not only do vectors in this algebra represent planes, but this practice implicitly selects a preferred origin while PGA in general is origin independent. I will say that I think this practice is admissable since no information is lost and because the more correct approach of representing free vectors as ideal points takes much more explanation to setup.
					  * Their approach to Lagrangians is awkward and I think can be much improved. In particular I think their appeal to dual PGA is unecessary.
					
					The YouTube channel [Bivector](https://youtube.com/@bivector) has talks about applications of geometric algebra. I've found Dorst's talks here about PGA to be particularly excellent.
					
					To really understand PGA I would urge you to read Charles Gunn's PhD thesis [*Geometry, Kinematics, and Rigid Body Mechanics in Cayley-Klein Geometries*](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/handle/11303/3355). This gives PGA as a more general construction on Cayley-Klein geometries, which means we can also apply the same ideas to hyperbolic and elliptic geometries. There is also a focus on how these ideas are related to projective geometry.
					
					Gunn's other works are also worth taking a look at, though generally what I've seen is him reiterating the ideas that are in his thesis.

			Since taking linear algebra in college I have always felt a "hole" in my mathematical awareness that was finally filled a couple years ago by Geometric Algebra. I found it deeply dissatisfying that the ideas of linear algebra didn't expand cleanly to higher dimensions or reduce cleanly to lower dimensions.  
			  
			For me the beauty of geometric algebra lies in defining intuitive meet and join operations between a set of primitives (joining two points into a line, joining two lines into a plane, meeting two planes into a line, meeting a sphere and a plane into a circle, etc). I really like ganja.js for exploring the practically useful GAs like [the 4,1,0 3D conformal](https://enkimute.github.io/ganja.js/examples/coffeeshop.html#cga3d_intersections). The same ideas in GA that extend from lines to planes and lines/planes to circles/spheres can be used to extend to quadrics and beyond.

	Hensel's creation of p-adic numbers and p-adic analysis, motivated in by the use of series expansions of functions in complex analysis, was regarded for quite some time as rather far out: when Hensel first presented his ideas in the 1890s, there was not yet a general framework of metric spaces or topology, so it was not easy for people to get used to these new number systems. And Hensel confused himself by thinking he had proved e is transcendental by confusing the real and p-adic values of ∑*_n≥0_* p^(n)/n!, which converges in both R and Q*_p_*.  

	The p-adic numbers were the first examples of fields (in the algebraic sense) that were not subfields of C, function fields, or finite fields, and thus provided an important inspiration for Steinitz's big 1910 paper creating field theory. See https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~roquette/STEINITZ.pdf. 

	The use of p-adic numbers in the classification of quadratic forms over all number fields (the Hasse-Minkowski theorem) in the 1920s, local class field theory in the 1930s, and Tate's work in the 1950s and 1960s (his thesis, rigid analytic geometry, etc) helped make p-adic numbers and analysis on them a more mainstream topic in mathematics.

						In particular, it's at least a little true about calculus, which is well-known for being a common hurdle for students and is sometimes perceived as a "weed-out" course.
						
						Calculus was HARD when people first came up with it -- and when you get down to it, calculus really wasn't very precise in the early days. People like Newton and Leibniz were essentially correct and got the right answers, but they said things along the lines of "dx is infinitely small yet not zero" which are frankly very difficult to make precise. Contemporaries such as Berkeley were skeptical about these imprecise descriptions of infinitesimal changes, and, to some extent, were not wrong to be skeptical about the imprecision.
						
						So, to summarize, differential calculus is a very commonly taught subject where we tend to say "Hey, come on, you 18-year-olds, you should be able to get this; after all, I've already done three examples" but it's also correct to point out that some of the more brilliant minds of the past wrestled and struggled with ways to make the subject precise and meaningful.

		That story sounds bogus.

			**[George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole)** 
			 
			 >George Boole (; 2 November 1815 – 8 December 1864) was a largely self-taught English mathematician, philosopher, and logician, most of whose short career was spent as the first professor of mathematics at Queen's College, Cork in Ireland. He worked in the fields of differential equations and algebraic logic, and is best known as the author of The Laws of Thought (1854) which contains Boolean algebra. Boolean logic is credited with laying the foundations for the Information Age.

	I'll give an example from applied math.

	Suppose we have an ODE representing some dynamical system in the form of d[u/dt](https://www.reddit.com/user/dt) = f(u), (where u is a vector of n state variables) and that it has a stable equilibrium at u_0. u here represent some quantity for which we are interested in how it evolves over time.

	Now let's say we are interested in how this quantity evolves over space as well. One of the simplest thing a quantity can do in space is diffusion, so this lead to the PDE:  d[u/dt](https://www.reddit.com/user/dt) = D∆u + f(u), where ∆ is the Laplacian and D is a diagonal matrix of diffusion coefficients.

	People use to think that this PDE would be uninteresting: since diffusion tends to smooth things out, if u(t)=u_0 is a stable solution to the ODE, then u(x,t)=u_0 has to be stable in the PDE. But Turing showed that this is in fact not true: in the simple n=2 case, it is possible for u_0 to be unstable in the PDE if the diffusion coefficients of the two variables are vastly different. This leads to a whole research program into "Turing patterns" and became a very influential idea in mathematical modelling of biology.

	Euler set the stage for graph theory and topology in formulating a "real-world" problem (Seven Bridges Königsberg) in a more abstract manner that was unconcerned with matters of distance. His statement of the polyhedron formula also contributed to topology later on.

	I don't know if these were controversial ideas necessarily, but they touch the "edges" of realism in the old traditions of mathematics. ;)

	1) For imaginary numbers a different word should have been used.

	2) For chaos and dynamical systems in partial deferential equations a different word should have been used.

		I wonder if it would be possible to introduce and standardize “lateral” as replacement for complex/imaginary. Maybe if Tao wrote a piece on it there would be enough momentum to get it going, ha.
