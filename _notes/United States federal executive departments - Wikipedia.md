"Executive Department" redirects here. For the idea of executive departments in general, see [Cabinet (government)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government) "Cabinet (government)").

The **United States federal executive departments** are the principal units of the [executive branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government) "Executive (government)") of the [federal government of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States"). They are analogous to [ministries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_(government_department) "Ministry (government department)") common in [parliamentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system "Parliamentary system") or [semi-presidential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-presidential_republic "Semi-presidential republic") systems but (the United States being a [presidential system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system "Presidential system")) they are led by a [head of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government "Head of government") who is also the [head of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state "Head of state"). The executive departments are the administrative arms of the [president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States"). There are currently 15 executive departments.

## Overview\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_federal_executive_departments&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Overview")\]

### Structure\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_federal_executive_departments&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Structure")\]

Each department is headed by a [secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_(title) "Secretary (title)") whose title echoes the title of their respective department, with the exception of the [Department of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice "United States Department of Justice"), whose head is known as the [attorney general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General "United States Attorney General"). The heads of the executive departments are appointed by the president and take office after [confirmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appointments_Clause "Appointments Clause") by the [United States Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate"), and serve [at the pleasure of the president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_the_president_of_the_United_States "Powers of the president of the United States"). The heads of departments are members of the [Cabinet of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States "Cabinet of the United States"), an executive organ that normally acts as an advisory body to the president. In the [Opinion Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_Clause "Opinion Clause") (Article II, section 2, clause 1) of the [U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States "Constitution of the United States"), heads of executive departments are referred to as "principal Officer in each of the executive Departments".

The heads of executive departments are included in the [line of succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession "United States presidential line of succession") to the president, in the event of a vacancy in the presidency, after the [vice president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States "Vice President of the United States"), the [speaker of the House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"), and the [president pro tempore of the Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate "President pro tempore of the United States Senate"). They are included in order of their respective department's formation, with the exception of the Secretary of Defense, whose position in the line of succession is based on when the Department of War was formed.

### Separation of powers\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_federal_executive_departments&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Separation of powers")\]

To enforce a strong [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution "Separation of powers under the United States Constitution"), the federal Constitution's [Ineligibility Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ineligibility_Clause "Ineligibility Clause") expressly prohibits executive branch employees (including heads of executive departments) from simultaneously serving in [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress"), and vice versa. Accordingly, in sharp contrast to virtually all other Western democracies (parliamentary systems) where [ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government) "Minister (government)") are selected to form a government from [members of parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament "Member of parliament"),<sup id="cite_ref-Wexler_Page_17_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments#cite_note-Wexler_Page_17-1">[1]</a></sup> U.S. legislators who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to serve as heads of executive departments must resign from Congress before assuming their new positions.<sup id="cite_ref-Wexler_Page_11_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments#cite_note-Wexler_Page_11-2">[2]</a></sup> If the emoluments for a new appointee's executive branch position were increased while the appointee was previously serving in Congress (e.g., [cost of living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living "Cost of living") adjustments), the president must implement a [Saxbe fix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxbe_fix "Saxbe fix").<sup id="cite_ref-Wexler_Page_13_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments#cite_note-Wexler_Page_13-3">[3]</a></sup>

### Contracting and grantmaking roles\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_federal_executive_departments&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Contracting and grantmaking roles")\]

As is evident from the chart below, several executive departments (Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation) have disproportionately small employee headcounts in contrast to the size of their budgets. This is because many of their employees merely supervise contracts with private [independent contractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_contractor "Independent contractor") or [grants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_grants_in_the_United_States "Federal grants in the United States") (especially [categorical grants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_grant "Categorical grant")) to [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States "State governments of the United States") or [local government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_the_United_States "Local government in the United States") agencies who are primarily responsible for providing services directly to the general public. In the 20th century, when the federal government began to provide funding and supervision for matters which were historically seen as the domain of state governments (i.e., [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States "Education in the United States"), [health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_the_United_States "Healthcare in the United States") and [welfare services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States "Social programs in the United States"), [housing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_in_the_United_States "Housing in the United States"), and [transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_in_the_United_States "Transportation in the United States")), Congress frequently authorized only funding for grants which were voluntary in the sense that state or local government agencies could choose to apply for such grants (and accept conditions attached by Congress), or they could decline to apply.<sup id="cite_ref-CRS_R40638_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments#cite_note-CRS_R40638-4">[4]</a></sup> In the case of HHS's [Medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States) "Medicare (United States)") program, Congress chose to contract with private health insurers because they "already possessed the requisite expertise for administering complex [health insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_in_the_United_States "Health insurance in the United States") programs", and because American hospitals preferred to continue dealing with private insurers instead of a new federal bureaucracy.<sup id="cite_ref-Kinney_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments#cite_note-Kinney-5">[5]</a></sup>
