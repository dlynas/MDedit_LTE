## Fascism, Sanitization, and Surface-level history on film: Glazer, Spielberg, Verhoeven, and Sam Fuller too

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1cdtv8f/fascism_sanitization_and_surfacelevel_history_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1cdtv8f/fascism_sanitization_and_surfacelevel_history_on/)

> Hey all. As we find ourselves sleepwalking towards Fascism in North America, I think it's more important than ever that we do our best to learn about Fascism, and how to educate ourselves and those around us about it, before it is too late. Of course, film is a wonderful medium for that, but not all films depicting the evils of Fascism are created equal, and in my opinion, some works are in fact quite detrimental to a general cultural education on Fascism.  
> 
> I would like to preface this too - my grandparents are/were Holocaust survivors. My grandfather's entire family was taken and murdered by the Nazis, after which he fought the Nazis as a partisan. My grandmother was born in 1939, and spent the first 6 years of her life hiding out in Siberia. I've grown up, as many Jewish people in the diaspora do, intimately familiar with these stories. It colours how I view current events and media, but it has given me a very specific take on Holocaust media, but I'll touch on that a little later. 
> 
> 
> I'd like to share some thoughts I had after recently watching both The Zone of Interest, and the WWII miniseries Masters of the Air (more specifically, the last episode, so consider this a spoiler warning.)
> 
> 
> I'll start off by saying that I found Zone of Interest to be extremely effective. The phrase "show, don't tell" comes up often in regards to the efficacy of exposition. Zone of Interest takes this to an extreme, something I would call "*Imply*, don't tell." The banality of evil is depicted better by *not* showing the evils of Nazism, only implying them largely through reference, inference, and implication. 
> 
> Like others, I was a little confused at first by the jarring ending of Zone of Interest involving a cut to the modern-day Auschwitz museum,specifically the army of employees/volunteers cleaning and dusting the exhibits before opening. Is it merely a flash forward in time to give a greater sense of the horrors we have only heard off screen, muffled and distant? What is with the cleaning ladies? 
> 
> 
> This ending became much clearer in intent in my mind after finishing the miniseries Masters of the Air. MotA follows in the footsteps of Band of Brothers and the Pacific, to complete a trip of WWII miniseries produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. While I largely enjoyed MotA, as I did the previous two series, I was left with a sour taste in my mouth after finishing it, largely because of the choices made in the last episode. 
> 
> While the series avoided narratives surrounding the Holocaust, a plot involving the lone Jewish character crash-landing behind Russian lines, being rescued, and stumbling into a liberated death camps is egregiously shoehorned into the final episode, and upon watching the out-of+nowhere, forced scene of Goldie in shock while the camera pans over piles upon piles of charred corpse pouring out of ovens, I realized what Jonathan Glazer intended by the ending of Zone of Interest
> 
> Remember how I said that my family history has influenced how I see Holocaust media? Well, my father shared an anecdote with me years ago that I still think on. While talking about Schindler's List, and the impact it had on culture when it came out, he said more or less the following 
> 
> > I saw Schindler's List once. It was a well made movie. A few clients who came into my office and knew I was Jewish mentioned seeing it to me, because it was the first time many gentiles had been exposed to a story like that. But, I don't feel a need to ever watch it again. *We* know those stories because we grew up with them. From our families, from our friends, and from our communities. Spielberg didn't make that film for *us*, he made it for the gentiles. 
> 
> I've thought plenty on that, and I feel more or less the same way. I find myself not viewing much Holocaust media because it is simply not providing anything new or helpful in how we look back on the Holocaust. I generally like Spielberg, but his take on Nazism largely starts and ends with "Nazis bad."
> 
> While I will admit, attitudes and education regarding the Holocaust are at an all-time low, and perhaps we do need reminders of that from time to time. However, when it comes to understanding how the Nazis were capable of perpetrating their evils, we are sorely lacking. At least, we were until Zone of Interest. 
> 
> I believe that in addition to largely being about the banality of evil and how someone could discard their baseline humanity, I think that Glazer is taking a direct shot at Spielberg, and his technique of blasting his audience in the chest from point blank with his emotional shotgun of corpses and ovens. Ironically, by  showing *so much*, Spielberg is sanitizing our narratives of the Holocaust, and preventing dialogue that delves deeper into the how and why of Nazism. When Glazer shows the display of piles of shoes from murdered victims, he is showing us a deliberate arrangement, much the same as Spielberg deliberately arranges his images for maximum emotional impact. But both are artificial, they are constructs made after the fact, to create a visceral response in the viewer. By showing the cleaning ladies wiping the glass in front of the shoe display case, Glazer is saying that we have "sanitized" our images of the Holocaust by only showing the most graphic images that demand emotional responses, but glossing over possible dialogue going deeper on the nature of Nazism, Fascism, and evil in general. I think this ending is also similar to the ending of Killers of the Flower Moon. It is an acknowledgement that regardless of the content, a film is still largely a commercial product made to be viewed by an audience, not a replacement for history. 
> 
> So how do we effectively create films that address the nitty-gritty details of how Fascism can rise and take hold, even in a population that largely believes that something like that could never happen here? Lucky for us, that movie already exists, and it's called Starship Troopers. 
> 
> 
> Paul Verhoevens Starship Troopersis known for it's strange place in culture and it's journey from misunderstood action flop, to revered satirical masterpiece, but I believe it is the single best, most important depiction of the specific details that make a society Fascist. First, I believe it's important to define Fascism, else we fall into the Spielberg trap of ending our thought at "Nazis bad." IMHO, Umberto Eco's essay on "Ur-Fascism" is the best set of characteristics of a Fascist society regardless of flavour. 
> 
> > 1. The cult of tradition", characterized by cultural syncretism, even at the risk of internal contradiction. When all truth has already been revealed by tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement.
> 
> > 2. "The rejection of modernism", which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the Enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system.
> 
> >3. "The cult of action for action's sake", which dictates that action is of value in itself and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with anti-intellectualism and irrationalism, and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science.
> 
> >4. "Disagreement is treason" – fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.
> 
> >5. "Fear of difference", which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.
> 
> 
> > 6. "Appeal to a frustrated middle class", fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.
> 
> > 7. "Obsession with a plot" and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society. Eco also cites Pat Robertson's book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession.
> 
> 
> > 8. Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as "at the same time too strong and too weak". On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.
> 
> > 9.   "Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy" because "life is permanent warfare" – there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to not build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.
> 
> 
> >10.  "Contempt for the weak", which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate leader, who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force.
> 
> > 11.  "Everybody is educated to become a hero", which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, "[t]he Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death."
> 
> > 12.."Machismo", which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold "both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality".
> 
> > 13. "Selective populism" – the people, conceived monolithically, have a common will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will (though truly he alone dictates it). Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of "no longer represent[ing] the voice of the people".
> 
> > 14. Newspeak" – fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning.
> 
> 
> Starship Troopers hits almost all of these absolutely dead on. For a film that very much appears to be simply saying "Nazis bad" (and Verhoeven has certainly said as much,) the great strength of Starship Troopers is it's subtlety. It's the little things that make Fascism, not just the big bad obviously evil stuff. 
> 
> Lastly, I'd like to recommend an alternative to the Spielberg school of WWII Holocaust media: Samuel Fuller's The Big Red One. Based on Fuller's own experiences fighting across Europe and Africa, and later being involved in the liberation of a concentration camp, Fuller takes the route of appealing to emotion, but in a much more pointed, charged way, without the over the top visuals and emotional manipulation of the Spielbergesque. I won't spoil it here, but I think that Fuller's depiction of the liberation of a camp provides a much more effective, if restrained afterimage of the Holocaust, not meant purely for shock value.

	I appreciate the effort taken here, and it feels earnest in so many ways, thank you for your writings. 

	In particular I like the discussion of how *Zone's* last moments address our sanitization of the Holocaust, those are some great observations. 

	I wrote a paper in like 2007 or so regarding *Ryan*'s "Spielbergian" tendencies to avoid realism in favour of little "gotcha" moments while playing at realism, and I can see elements of that in place with your contribution here. 

	It is fascinating the way *Zone* has come to the forefront of contemporary film discussion, and I love it. Glazer's work here is fantastic and just feels like the future of cinema.

	I have to disagree with your reading of zone of interest a little, I think what made it so powerful were two things. Firstly, it is very explicitly not a movie about the banality of evil. And secondly it refused to traffick in the idea there is anything particularly interesting to say about fascism.

	The banality of evil refers to the idea that monstrous evil requires a bureaucracy of uncommitted people just doing their work. That is not at all what we get in the zone of interest, we get the hoess family, enthusiastic Nazis commited entirely to the Nazi cause. Rudolph hoess is not a faceless cog in a machine just getting by, he wants to clear a geographic area of undesirable people so that people like him, and his family, can live there in peace and abundance.

	That, to me, is what made the movie so effective, he wasn't a cartoon villain exuding evil or just a guy following orders, he had decided that it was necessary to murder millions of people to give himself and family a better life, the message wasn't 'look at this idyllic home juxtaposed with monstrous evil' the desire for an idyllic home was evil in and of itself.

	As for the second point, it's what sets it apart from Spielberg, there really isn't much more to say about fascism than 'fascists are evil and do evil things' fascists have dreary small goals and desires that are completely understandable instantly and have no depth. The reason why zone of interest works so well is because it's very clear, the only difference between a Nazi and a suburban Subaru dealer who talks about crime in the city and illegals at the border is that there isn't yet an infrastructure in place for mass murder of the people they dislike.

	Schindlers list is so trite and weightless because it's premise that society needs good people to do good things and have good ideas to counter the bad people who do bad things and have bad ideas, there's nothing to do with that, it's not just facile, it's not true.

		I got nothing else to say other than I think you're right, and that's a far more powerful  take than simply the banality of evil. Also gives me a new appreciation for the film.

		I didn't like Zone Of Interest, but this comment made me dislike it a little less.

		You say "fascists are evil and do evil things" but that kind of mentality won't defeat fascism. There's been a dangerous tendency to paint Nazis and other fascist groups as inhuman monsters who have little in common with normal people. Naturally, no one sees themself as evil or an inhuman monster, so clearly they must be immune to fascist ideology. The fact is that Nazi Germany wasn't some Bizarro World alternate dimension where an entire society decided to do evil things. They were normal people facing a convergence of abnormal circumstances that enabled an evil regime to take power. People need to understand that the same thing could happen to any society under the right circumstances if we don't recognize the warning signs and resist them.
		
		I agree with OP that *Starship Troopers* is an effective satire of fascism, especially because it's able to show the attractive, propagandic image of a fascist society while also showing (or implying) the faults and failings of that society. This avoids the trap of dehumanizing the target of criticism. We need to be able to understand and empathize with people we disagree with--not for their benefit, but for our own.

			Does not imply that they are inhuman monsters with little in common with regular people, i think you just completely misunderstood what i wrote

				You didn't directly say that, but that's a common narrative about them, especially when terms like "evil" are used. People often use this terms to distance themselves from those being discussed. If we tell ourselves, "Those people are just evil," we're excusing ourselves from trying to understand their perspective and motivation. I apologize if I misinterpreted your post, but I thought this is an important point to raise in a discussion about portrayals of fascism in media.
