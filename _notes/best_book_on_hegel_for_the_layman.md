## Best Book on Hegel for the Layman

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/90s6x5/best_book_on_hegel_for_the_layman/](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/90s6x5/best_book_on_hegel_for_the_layman/)

> I am getting very into the history of ideas. I just finished Age of Anger by Mishra, and I am excited to start diving into some other books. I am reading about Rousseau atm, and I am going to meander my way into the German thinkers soon. I have read overviews of Hegel's philosophy, the way he shaped Marx, and the influence of his work. I am not a big fan based on what I read, but I would would like to understand him better. I have not attempted any of his books yet. This is partly due to intimidation (I heard that one of his books has an intro that is 500 pages long), and partly because I have heard he is one of the most difficult philosophers to understand. Are there any books out there that explain Hegel's ideas in such a way that the average reader (that would be me) can understand and critique? Preferably I am looking for a book that discusses his ideas, but also his life. I see that Charles Taylor wrote a biography that looks interesting. Is that a good place to start? If not, are there any better books you all would recommend? I appreciate any and all input. Thank you!

	I'd heavily recommend *Reason and Revolution* by Herbert Marcuse, particularly if you are interested in Hegel's influence on Marx and how Hegel fits into the broader Enlightenment tradition. It's not really a neutral academic intro - Marcuse certainly favored an interpretation in line with the Left-Hegelians, and wrote the book in part as a critique of fascist interpretations of Hegel - but Marcuse displays a strong understanding of the texts, and explains Hegel's philosophy and historical context with readable and engaging prose.

		Oh! *Phenomenology and System*! For some reason, I thought this was *Hegel's Ladder*, and I was like: "that would be a rather intense place to start."  
		
		
		But yeah, P&amp;S is a great little text for getting a quick overview of Hegel.

		Thank you! I am quite excited to find this sub. I am going to be browsing the old posts to see if any questions I have were already answered on here. This place is a great resource. My degree is not in philosophy, so my personal knowledge is very limited.

	Forget Kojeve unless you want Hegel-filtered-through-Marx-filtered-through-existentialism (although I wouldn't blame you if that's what you wanted). Forget also books that would cover all of Hegel in a mere couple hundred pages. The level of abstraction required for such a scope makes them almost all useless. Taylor's is the closest that comes to being useful but it's anything but an uncontroversial or even up to date text.

	When introducing a philosopher, the point, in my opinion, should not be to try to say something about everything but to explicate a handful of central issues and concepts which together serve to illuminate the whole. Focusing on one aspect and getting that one halfway right pays off more then hearing stories about a supposedly cosmic mind developing according to some dialectic.

	I would therefore suggest you read the introduction, the chapter on sense certainty and the chapter on perception in the Phenomenology of Spirit. The introductions and corresponding chapters in Stern's short commentary  and Hyppolite's long and masterful commentary will get you through those chapters and explain roughly what's going on. Bernsteins lectures on the PoS are also available for free online (and they're good too) 

	If you still want something like a global Exposé, Reading Hegel: The Introductions and Yovel's commentary on the preface to the PoS are your best bets.

	None of this makes for easy reading. My honest suggestion would be to read Kant instead.

	Hey, check out The Logic of Desire by Peter Kalkavage. It's essentially a running commentary on the Phenomenology; and it's very approachable while also respecting the depth of Hegel's thought. I read it side by side with the Phenomenology and it definitely helped me get more out of it.

		I would second this recommendation. Kalkavage explicitly made this book with casual readers attempting to understand Hegel for themselves in mind. It's very well written and accessible.
		
		Hyppolite and Harris are two of the most important commentaries, but I don't think either of them are as *accessible* as Kalkavage.  
		
		
		I would also like to echo those who mentioned that Taylor's *Hegel* and Kojeve's *Introduction to the Reading of Hegel* are very outdated to say the least. Kojeve especially seems to be talking more about Heidegger than Hegel. 
		
		\[Also, I have only really glanced over Beiser's book on Hegel, but based on his other works, you might also check this out.\] /[u/GdanskBoy](https://www.reddit.com/user/GdanskBoy)

			Appreciate the recommendations from both of you! Thanks for taking the time to answer.

	well if you are from the Anglo-american world a good start is the various companions (I know Routledge and Cambridge but I'm certain there are others)

	I cannot say what books are the best but I will recommend the following:

	*  "Hegel, Three Studies" by Adorno

	*  "Understanding Hegelianism" by Robert Sinnerbrink

	*  "Introduction to the reading of Hegel" by Alexandre Kojeve.

	All the above combined will give you a good idea about Hegel's ideas and his progeny (followers and critics).

		Thank you for the quick response! Now I feel even more intimidated lol. I am going to check out the books you mentioned. Are you a Hegel fan? Do you think he was a genius, or a windbag? This opinion seems to divide a lot of academics that I have come across.

		For what it's worth, I found Taylor's Hegel a walk in the park relative the Hegel.
