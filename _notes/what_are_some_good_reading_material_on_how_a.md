## What are some good reading material on how a left-wing society should deal with incels and alienated men?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1adzund/what_are_some_good_reading_material_on_how_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CriticalTheory/comments/1adzund/what_are_some_good_reading_material_on_how_a/)

> I have to admit I have never seen any meaningful left-wing solutions to incels and alienated men. Right-wing gurus are everywhere, but their views on women and LGBT are terrible. They do, however, offer greater meaning than just hedonism and sex. I think there is an issue on the left that forgets that every society in the past has had a "monk" caste, men that weren't supposed to have sex and were more isolated, yet were respected by society. The modern equivalent of this is incels or hikikomoris, but it is a group that is mocked and not given any meaningful solution for a need for greater meaning.
> 
> What are some good books or essays offering solutions other than "just go to the gym, be more confident, go to therapy, the only things that matters is art and sex",etc? What are some good, **left-wing** help for greater meaning for these kind of people? Modern neoliberal society just calls the incel and alienated men problem out and condemns it but never offers a meaningful solution.
> 
> The reason I am asking this is because of the recent statistic of polarization of politics between men and women. It is going to be a really dangerous issue in the future if we can't help give men greater purpose:  [A new global gender divide is emerging (ft.com)](https://www.ft.com/content/29fd9b5c-2f35-41bf-9d4c-994db4e12998)

> TL;DR:  Reading material on Left-wing solutions to give men greater meaning?
> 
> Thank you!
> 
> EDIT: I got way more replies than expected and some in-depth ones too. Going to need some time to write up a reply
> 
> EDIT 2: To clarify - I do not only mean men who want sex and nothing else. I also (failed) to make it clear I am talking about existentially lost men, existential alienation. Men lost without a greater purpose, perhaps people who feel lost in relativism and hedonism, so to speak. Not everyone is going to find the pursuit of individual whims or pursuit of art as the highest good as fulfilling. I think people like that (and I admit I myself might belong in this existentially lost category) need some kind of greater goal that is seen as objective.

	The incel phenomenon may well be seen as a unique manifestation of late capitalism, and a significant aspect of the double bind that distorts the personalities of some young men characterized this way stems from the insistance of the cultural narrative that a limited set of materialist values form the basis of individual worth, primarily wealth and significant consumption. This, coupled with the decline of real education in the US, with, increasingly, everything narrowly focused on vocational skills and/or class-signaling ideological belief structures, to the exclusion of most wider appreciation of human values residing in art and culture, sociology and the soft sciences, and  the "broadening" effects of a more general education in the abstract, leaves under-educated hyper-consumerism conditioned young people feeling themselves to be "failures" according the the standards of a crassly materialist society that their education has not given them the tools to re-evaluate on their own terms.

		I realize this does not really address your "gender divide" concerns adequately: I think this may be resulting from the internalization of materialist values and criteria along with patriarchal social structures that additionaly restrict evaluation of male "worth" to the traditional male role of breadwinner, in a time when women are overshadowing many young men in their efforts to advance beyond the limitations society has previously placed upon them, so unfortunately it is a philosophical "path of least resistance" for many of these young men, to see themselves as marginalized and to position themselves negatively toward what they see as the political sources of this marginalization.

			The systematic elimination of male-only community spaces - colleges, gyms, church fellowship groups, workplaces, saunas - while in many cases justified, has in addition to the erosion of third spaces in general also contributed to the social alienation of men, and the construct of patriarchy often punishes the pursuit of solidarity, consciousness-raising, or fellowship seeking among men that would make them construct alternatives.

		Pretty good, and consider too the literal structure of our (American) society - communities divided by highways that cannot be crossed unless you leave your atomized residence in an atomized personal automobile, to go do something which is probably soon to be replaced by a virtual version you won't need to leave for. Where does a large community of people physically interacting on a long term basis even happen nowadays? In school, and some (now less) jobs, I guess, but that means you mostly have until age 18 or 22 to acquire connections organically from a physical community. After that, you'll have to either draw from the network you hopefully built, be in a job or niche hobby group with a similar vibe, or you'll have to be a lot more active and intentional in making forming connections individually which is harder and less durable (e.g., much more vulnerable to bad first impressions, random schedule conflicts, etc.).

		This is a strictly class based look at things.
		
		
		I would take insights from decolonialism. The citizen is defined in terms of the outsider. And the outsider is defined by the state to control the citizen. Furthermore, systems of control are first tested out on the outsider before being applied to the citizen. I also think the situation is recursive.
		
		
		Propaganda is mostly intended for citizens not for outsiders. Transphobia is not about controlling trans people. Transphobia is about controlling cis people. There's just not enough trans people to exploit for money.
		
		
		I think also in a very real way men are feminized, queered, darkened, crippled, mentally pathologized and so on as systems of control that start with the outsider get applied to the citizen.
		
		So what was once the slave patrol becomes the modern police force applied to everyone. Or how the police force is militarized. Or how drug criminalization is first used for targeting minority groups but is then used to target others.
		
		
		I think the right is wrong in why "everyone is queer and brown these days". But there is something there about how the violence of the state is expanded from being applied from a minority into being applied to more and more groups.

				So different prejudices serve different purposes. Some prejudices are mostly about controlling the in-group and some prejudices are mostly about controlling the out-group. Most forms of prejudice are a mix of both functions.
				
				
				One type of bigotry leans towards: a man shouts "Look behind you, there is a monster" and rifles through your pocket. The other pole of bigotry leans towards directly controlling "the monster." 
				
				
				Another way of thinking about it is a school yard bully picking on the weakest kid on class to threaten others. The bully's actions are not always personal. The victim is sometimes just a convenient target.
				
				
				I have my own takes on what kinds of discrimination are mostly "impersonal" or mostly "personal". But I'm not sure how to make it less subjective.
				
				
				My vibes are queerphobia strongly leans towards controlling the sexuality and gender of straight people. Misogyny leans towards controlling the sexuality and gender of men. Colonialism begins with simple resource extraction but overtime begins to evolve features for controlling the colonising people.
				
				
				Importantly, just because the discrimination leans more to controlling the in-group doesn't mean the out-group gets it any better necessarily. It has to be a punishment to be a woman in order to get men to work long hours and do other shitty stuff. Misogyny has to exist for "bitch" to be a threat. But women have to work harder not to be a "bitch". A person of color has to work harder to be "civil."

					I think misogyny controlling the sexuality and gender of men with the class of "women" being the threatening out group is a useful exploitative function of the patriarchy that exists equally along side women being controlled.  
					
					
					Can you elaborate on how I'm mistaken about the primary function of patriarchy? The way I understand it, the primary function is to control both equally with both respective outgroup classes being the threat.

	When you say, paraphrasing loosely, that the “left forgets about historical examples of a celibate caste of men who nevertheless were respected” and equivocating this with current day incels it seems to me that you’re really just ratifying the incel’s position that they are disrespected and marginalized because of their celibacy. I don’t see any reason, meaning comparable material conditions or social factors, to pose an equivalence between the Catholic priesthood or Buddhist clergy (as an example) and incels and hikikomoris and would argue that posing such an equivalence flattens out any granular detail in the history of any of these phenomena in order to index them all to celibacy.

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 25 _(2024-01-29 14:36:02)_

		Plus, even with those who were forced to be celibate like eunuchs there still is no real equivalence to incels. Eunuchs are forced to be celibate because of something physically done to them. Incels aren't forced to be celibate, but they sure do love to act like they are because of spite against some perceived injustice.

		* 🟧 **[Nyarlist](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nyarlist)** ⬆️ 18 _(2024-01-29 18:33:24)_

			Many eunuchs weren’t celibate. Eunuchs still have sexuality. What they can’t do is procreate, and so are not threatening to an inheritance-based social order.

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 9 _(2024-01-29 23:11:04)_

				This depends on the method of creating a eunuch. Some lost their testicles some lost the penis, many lost the entire set. 
				
				Regardless comparing them to incels is absurd. Eunuchs were sold into slavery basically as an almost universal of history. The monks and eunuchs that OP refers to willingly chose those lives out of virtue or were raised into those life's again also out of virtue. 
				
				The incels of today are just sexually frustrated men who can't comprehend their poor social skills and warped expectations of the opposite sex are repulsive to prospective partners. There is no social classifications, no deeply held virtues, no literal enslavements. They're just dudes routinely making shitty decisions.

					I find this a bit weird. Maybe you're not a leftist, I dunno, but it seems like many leftists will talk about superstructure and ideology and alienation, and even discuss philosophy about free will, perhaps be entirely historicist or materialist and deny the entire concept... and then for some group of rightists or assholes go 'but fuck those guys'.
					
					I hate all that liberal 'volunteer Nazi safety advocate' stuff, but this doesn't seem a consistent approach. Can we really think incels are victims of patriarchy, alienation, and the commodification of sex AND misogynist assholes who have only themselves to blame?

						I mean.... I don't see why not?

						Does this sub believe people like Elliot Rodgers deserves sympathy? Not that I'm opposed to that more that I just don't understand like, what would come of it? Ive never heard of anyone being genuinely sympathetic to people like this before. I've read of plenty of people who talk about origins for these things but I've never met someone genuinely sympathetic to those people. 
						
						Like, antifa and all that ya know? How can you be an anti-fascist and not hold a violent disposition to people like this?

							I don't know. I don't know the answer to this, but it seems like a fundamental issue that deserves exploring.
							
							We'll look at wrong-doers of various kinds and look at the social factors that led to them doing those things, but then we look at someone privileged like Trump, who almost almost certainly had the same emotionally abusive childhood he is giving his own children, and doesn't seem to have any relationships that aren't transactional, and is utterly alone, and just go 'well fuck that guy'. And I want to agree, because he's my enemy, and an asshole, but that seems unwise.
							
							Or on the left I see a lot of people saying that we can't solve crime with violence, but can solve fascism that way, and I'm curious if anyone has a solid rational defence for that difference. It all just seems based on emotion. Maybe all the other people here have a good answer for this issue, but I don't, and I'm hoping someone will educate me.

							* ⬛️ **[deleted]** ⬆️ 0 _(2024-01-30 09:08:16)_

								I think the argument of meeting fascism with violence comes from there just not being a Google example of defeating it without violence. Deradicalization is a long process that takes institutional level resources and is almost never completed in the individual. If you have a large group of friends and one of them starts to stay into incel territory or "race realism" or whatever I'd say you have a good chance of winning them back. But if you are one or two of the leftists in a larger friend group generally moving that direction it's better for you to disassociate or else risk interpolating their ideals subconsciously. 
								
								Now when it comes to incels I think the answer of their origins is simple. The abolition of patriarchy is incomplete. Women have been liberated to some degree and men sense this as a result men not fully educated to leftist ideals can only fall back on traditionalism. When they find this traditionalism is more of a detriment to their dating prospects than an advantage, and mixed with the still repressive aspects patriarchy places on lower caste males they develop a victim complex which is amplified by other forces in society looking for a vulnerable Yung population to take advantage of. Which is the simple recipe for any reactionary the incel is just specific to patriarchy. These men will not reproduce and have children so their views will die with their generation for the most part. Of course there is it's cultural dissemination but for the few men who are capable of recognizing the farce of gender roles they won't really be victims to that thought process. 
								
								It's a weird scenario where reactionaryism isn't on the side of reproduction. Atheism for example, they are less likely to have kids and raise a traditional family. Homosexual relationships are in many jurisdictions banned from adoption and prejudices against them still hold this back. As a result these ideals of heteronormativity, religious fundamentalism, etc are reproduces with the family unit. The incels phenomena is unique in that women's liberation has reached a point where it will not reproduce with the family unit and will have to now for the long term rely on disaffected youth. Which, may indicate a greater shift down the line in hownthe family unit is structured and what ideological values it reproduces with it as we see things like polyamory and homosexuality become more common in sexually liberated communities. 
								
								Incels aren't raised by leftists. They're raised by centrists going rightward.
								
								**Edit** do you have any idea or formulation on how to recover incels? Like, can we save a rapist without jail or execution? I'd like to believe that and advocate for it but I've never read anything about how exactly to do so. I definitely can agree with prison reform and I want to agree with abolition but I sure as shit can't make the argument for it myself. Which feels like a failing on my part.

										Your first point is ignoring my wider context where I do address cultural reproduction.  
										
										Also, this is a sliding scale. These things are on a spectrum.  I don't know your age but when the term "incel" first reached the popular lexicon incels were not just quiet shut ins. They were the Andrew Tate rapists they were the Elliot Rodgers murders. The incels subreddit was horrific and has men anonymously advocating for the state to legally force women to be with them. They originated the concept of "the dating economy" and sometimes even advocated for fucked up shit like science preserve women's bodies slightly longer to be used for necrophilia. Incels are not quiet shut ins.

			Exactly. It's a lackluster comparison, though it may serve a similar societal function in a way (less "loser" men out there making things unstable). The priesthood served as a repository for second and later sons in a system where the elite typically replied on primogeniture (following a variety of more equal inheritance systems that caused incessant warfare). They were taken care of, could amass power and wealth within this system, often had mistresses etc. It was just a way to ensure resources/power remained stable, compared to a system like gavelkind or confederate partition.

	I'm surprised no one has mentioned the book *The Will to Change* or bell hooks' work in general. *All About Love* and *Feminism is for Everybody* are also books by her that touch on this subject. Admittedly, she's controversial for being a more moderate leftist as well as being focused on compassion towards men as opposed to a more pessimistic and militant emphasis on women pursuing liberation and expression without/against men. 

	Hooks believes that the essence of patriarchy in relation to men is mass ritual self-harm, mutilation of their souls. Men are taught by other men to force themselves to fit a tyrannical model of masculinity which is included but not limited to withholding love from men and women and directing violence towards anything that threatens their masculinity. They hurt themselves and other men for not being masculine enough and assert dominance and difference from women.

	They're taught that if they're gentle, that's not manly, if they're sad, that's not manly, if they're peaceful, that's not manly, and so on and so forth. Before men begin to hold any contempt for women, they're taught to hold contempt for the nonconforming parts of themselves. They're taught to make sure other men are also being manly enough. The result is that they can only reap any benefit from patriarchy if they enslave themselves to it.

	>The first act of violence that patriarchy demands of males is not violence toward women. Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage in acts of psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves. If an individual is not successful in emotionally crippling himself, he can count on patriarchal men to enact rituals of power that will assault his self-esteem. 

	However, it's not merely men who're capable of perpetuating this cycle. Women are more than capable of attacking men's self esteem through their perceived masculinity. Men believe that feminists aren't their ally because they just see people who expect them to continue these patriarchal rituals, except they're non-men who want to take away the rewards they get by conforming to masculinity. From their perspective, feminism is their enemy.

	She emphasizes that neither men nor masculinity are inherently the enemy of feminists. Patriarchy doesn't actually understand masculinity/femininity nor men/women. 

	Patriarchy teaches people to see the relationship between men and women as a power struggle, they can either "win" or "lose." Men's fear isn't entirely illusory since there are plenty of feminists who, even if not wholly intentionally, are misandrist yet simultaneously expect men to embody the convenient aspects of patriarchy in order to be valuable in their eyes and blur the line between hating misogyny and assuming that men's misogyny is inherent to them as people. Therefore, hooks believes that feminists must learn and practice love towards men.

	This would include incels and other alienated men.

	Hikkikomori is a mental health issue, essentially social anxiety or agoraphobia. 

	I know that some theorists reject or at least critique the concept of mental health and illness - Foucault, of course, but many others. But I don’t see people with this issue as at all similar to ‘incels’. 

	Honestly, I’d reject that label too. Misogyny and toxic masculinity do a lot of damage to people, but they aren’t actually celibates. They are alienated and misguided. And sometimes hateful. But not actually ‘incels’. And many members of religious orders, globally, did often have sex.

			No. My issue is simply as I said. These two things are not the same.
			
			‘Hikkikomori’ is a condition most westerners know very little about, and sufferers encounter othering from Japanese conservatives and then the whole of Japan is heavily othered by westerners.    
			
			I don’t use the term, myself, and nor do most mental health professionals in Japan.

	I have a bit of a problem with the sentiment of "there is no meaningful left-wing solution to incels" or "the left has abandoned men". Primarily because it makes it sound like no one has tried to tackle the issue meaningfully. It's not like people haven't tried to tactfully and politely challenge incels and misogynist many many many times over. It only seems like incels and misogynists are only ever met with derisiveness and contempt because that's what gets the most attention and eyes thus always being at the forefront of discussions.

	I, as a man, have personally tried so many times to politely and tactfully challenge these sorts of beliefs when I encounter them. And you know what happens more often than not? Those men just double down harder on the rhetoric, then slap you with some buzzword like "white knight" or "doublethink" to just completely disregard your argument and points.

So not capitalism writ large but the specific changes in search and matching and sexual economics mediated by online dating tools and and a long term bias towards gender and pay parity in workforce participation that by definition makes male romantic / coupling labor less valuable.

			I don't think it's just a matter of challenging beliefs but I do think it's the biggest part of it. Like yes for example I do agree men's mental health is a real issue and needs to be taken seriously. But the issue can't be tackled effectively, either personally or politically, unless these men are willing to have their beliefs challenged and engage in good faith.
			
			
			On a personal level, more men should seek professional help for their mental health like therapy. But therapy is only going to be effective if the patient is willing to engage with it in good faith. It requires one to self reflect and to deconstruct their views and beliefs on things. It's not going to work if you're not willing to budge on anything. It also doesn't help that when this stubbornness occurs those men will tell other like minded men that therapy is useless and makes it less likely that other men will go to therapy.
			
			
			On a political level the issue can be tackled by allocating more funds and resources to healthcare, including mental healthcare, and making it more accessable. Something that is championed predominantly by those on the political left. But that can't happen if most of these men believe that mental healthcare is useless and are either politically apathetic or vote for people who aren't going to do this.

	The left has been offering dismantling patriarchy and sexual liberation for decades.  Non-patriarchal human societies don't have incel problems because everyone is sexually promiscuous, women don't get judged for who they fuck and how often they fuck, child-raising is communal, and marriage and monogamy are irrelevant and do not exist.  End society structured around intensely regulating sexual behavior with millions of laws governing family, marriage, and fornication.

	That solution has been around for decades.  Men infected with right-wing brain worms have zero interest in that or in anything else leftist.

		&amp;#x200B;
		
		Well considering the sort of social groups you're describing are in small, tightly knit tribal settings, that is unsurprising. When we're discussing an ailment of a highly scaled civilization, I don't know it meaningfully addresses the problem.
		
		&amp;#x200B;
		
		I assume everyone here would agree that monogamy, family oriented parenting and marriage are deeply ingrained in Western society, and in addition recognizes that its antediluvian derivatives were also locked into some form of sexual organization, regardless if it was polygamous, non-christian, or even matriarchal. These sexually laissez-faire, communal parenting societies often brought up in CT are almost exclusively small tribal island societies with no competing tribes, and about nowhere in history do these societies scale. I'd argue that there is a reasonable positive correlation between sexual organization and social scalability. From this, I'd also argue that societies that sexually organize unlock the capability to organize everything else, which allows them to out-scale societies that fail to do the same. My question for critical theorists is whether or not it's reasonable to decouple contemporary structures from the organization of sexual relationships in a society without making it vulnerable to other societies that refuse to participate by the same principles.
		
		&amp;#x200B;
		
		One could argue that it's ethically wrong to prioritize the group interest over the individual's \*autonomy, but arguably, the only reason we can even abstract these ideas and dialogue about whether it's wrong or right is because of the structures we've inherited, which are derivative of sexual organization. I also have to ask about the underlying psychological arguments inherent to critical theory regarding this. Freud argues that the sexual repression innate to Western structures promotes both the success and ailments of society at scale and at the level of the individual, which satisfies the outcome of the phenomena of the sexually laissez-faire island society and the one we live in. Can a world that moves beyond sexual repression and preserves other social orders exist and if so, what does it look like? I can't help but feel critical theory is very anti-structure, and often doesn't posit what a society free of these boundaries looks like or how it functions.
		
		I'm still relatively green when it comes to critical theory so I appreciate the insight, and a lot of what I write is off the cuff and based on my own biases so I recognize not everything I write is ground truth or bullet proof. Thank you.

			This is essentially the same question as "is socialism in one country possible," and my answer is no, it really isn't.  We de-militarize and de-capitalize and de-patriarchy globally or we don't do it at all.  The revolution is a gradual change in global human culture over a long period, not something that comes crashing down by electing the right people or seizing a government.

			You are raising a good point there. Also we tend to forget that the ultimate drive of partnerships is still reproduction. Saying children can be community raised is underestimating the ressources needed and parental love necessary for raising a child in an advanced civilization like ours. Without a family unit people would just use birth control to save their potential children from being neglected and themselves from being alone with them. The marital contract archaic as it is is still something thats providing a legal framework to protect children. In return they provide kind of a greater goal to the marriage contract. Otherwise they would be pretty useless and much more burdensome for our individual lives.

			A society without *any* class division or property is fairly unknown too, doesn’t make it a bad goal. 
			
			I’d recommend Engels’ “The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State” as a starting place for socialist thought about the connections between patriarchy, the family and capitalism. He directly ties the origins of the strictly monogamous nuclear family to Roman property law which deeply impacted European concepts of property, and led in part to the development of capitalism. 
			
			I also really enjoy Federici’s “Caliban and the Witch” which explores how the witch hunts in the 1300s onward were deeply tied to the dissolution of feudalism and the rise of capitalist relations, and explores what family life looked like before capitalism (crucially, that monogamous nuclear families were largely for the wealthy, that regular people’s love lives and family structures didn’t necessarily fit into that mold, and that part of the origins of capitalism lay in a long process which progressively forced these proto-proletarians into that mold).
			
			And consider the recent changes in family law in Cuba. While it does not entirely eliminate “the family” as a concept it did go a long way towards achieving what the Manifesto meant about abolishing the family as a legally-enforced structure.

					Some examples are the Souix (studies of which Engles based his book on), the Wari, the Mosuo.  But it was really most non-patriarchal societies that lacked marriage.
					
					The problem in studying this is all of our modern information about non-patriarchal societies comes from mostly eurpoean anthropologists who studied them, and they filtered everything through a euro lens.  All of them assumed marriage was universal, so they looked for anything remotely resembling it in new peoples and said "aha found marriage!  these people have odd marriage customs."  Of course, none of it was remotely like what we associate with marriage.
					
					For example, one real human universal is experiencing romantic attraction.  Non-patriarchal societies were familiar with two young people lovey dovey for each other and they had words to describe it and recognize it.  Euro anthropologists would say "oh that's marriage" when it doesn't include monogamy and lacks any of the other regulatory and proscriptive force of marriage in patriarchal societies.  Or in another example, they would find a sexually promiscuous tribe where everyone has sex with everyone else and raises children as a group, and say "oh they practice group marriage" when that's just a euro lense perspective on the fact that they lack marriage.

		This idea can't really account for the rise of patriarchy from non-patriarchal societies. A sexual marketplace only arises in the presence of a marketplace of goods.

			That's not fully accurate, at least not without better defining work.  Chimps trade food for sex.  Penguins trade stones used to build nests for sex.  Patriarchy and capitalism certainly have an effect on the structure and form of sex work, but it can and does exist outside of both.

		Many self-identified incels actually do have sex (or could easily have sex but choose not to). Men who don't have access to sex for whatever reason, like an illness or disability, are usually not the people going on chan sites to talk about how much they hate women. Incels usually don't have issues like a lack of income or lack of access to birth control.
		
		Issues like wanting to have sex with a person who looks a certain way are often rooted in social prejudice rather than a desire to have satisfying sex. People who aren't reactionary but recognize that their preferences make them unhappy can become less strict and broaden their horizons.
		
		Any set of policies that gives workers more economic security and more control over their lives will mean more people will have time in their day to relax and have sex for reasons other than making more babies.

			In my experience much of my issues came down to I felt unloveable at home and at school so I used masturbation to cope.

					> For many incels, though, I think they just want patriarchy. Patriarchal thinking is also a major source of viewing sex as social validation.
					
					
					I think patriarchy is shaped around sex as one of the few socially acceptable means of physical intimacy. But I think sex is inherently associated with intimacy and love to some extent. The problem is that there is not enough love and not that we should disassociate love from sex.
					
					
					I guess I also worry you do not care about structural issues. It is not enough to talk about nonsexual forms of physical intimacy. We also have to change the structure of society that gates physical intimacy. Because I oppose emotionally distant and abusive families I am a strong family abolitionist. We need housing and food security so mothers and children can move out of abusive relationships.
					
					
					I don't like to talk about this but I was very touch averse before I started my transition. Learning to trust and touch others took many years of hard work. Neurodivergent people and victims of abuse are very likely to have such sensory issues. Because of my issues with physical intimacy masturbation was one of the few ways I could self-soothe with physical touch. ADHD brains and especially unmedicated brains also crave easy dopamine.
					
					
					So I worry you are looking at the wrong problems. There are structural reasons for much of why my life turned out the way it did. I can take responsibility for my own actions but I cannot accept setting up others for failure.

							Yes. Because of stigma some people avoid relationships they would otherwise have. I am not sure what you mean by oppressive relationships.

	I can identify with where your question is coming from, and I also think that the left is not doing so well appealing to young men. However, I take issue with your framing, and I think that is the primary benefit of studying philosophy and critical theory, to understand psychologically, sociologically how ideology frames even what the question is.

	Why does this demand exist on the part of incels and their allies for feminism/the left/"critical theory" to provide solutions for them? This is the falsehood at the root of their victimhood mentality - which they unconsciously copy from whom they set themselves in opposition to. Why is the solution to identity politics more identity politics? If your identity is recognized, I demand mine is recognized too! This is liberal Hegelianism. If incels took their own anxiety - the anxiety of not being masculine enough - seriously, they would realize that there is actually some ground for that, regardless of what leftists, feminists or critical theorists have to say about it. Why would you expect feminism to recognize and articulate male subjectivity? That is illogical on the face of it. Critical theory is not just a set of texts, on the most fundamental level it means thinking about the social world critically, and that includes being critical of that which names itself critical. Be open to learning, but don't expect pre-formulated answers for your problems. It is your existential responsibility to do that - meaning is an act of creation. The answer to incels' problem is inherent in the very questions they ask - they are insecure in their masculinity. Why? Because they don't take ownership of their agency and power, and project their insecurities onto others creating a victim mentality. Do not expect critical theory or the left to provide you a solution - become part of the solution. Instead of fishing for excuses why you are not masculine, be more masculine - assert yourself, create your own movement for the positive benefit of advancement of men's interests, and separate this from the toxic projection onto women and feminism. They have enough problems, let them be! By getting outside yourself, learning about others' problems on their own terms, maybe they will start to understand your problems on your terms too.  

	But to answer your question more directly, I know that incel types are already attracted to Nietzsche. Again, my response is to take yourself more seriously. Take the reading of Nietzsche more seriously, so that you actually understand the concept of ressentiment. Start there - his work is a strong influence on many critical theorists and thinkers, such as Foucault Deleuze and Heidegger. It is a good foundation, if you resist and see through the terrible misreadings of him by those with a political agenda.

		The problem is that Nietzsche don't really work for people like me. I am a left-wing person from a standpoint of empathy and secular slave-morality, as bad as that sounds. I think the people who will find existential fulfillment are those who manage to create meaning through art and worship aesthetics, as Nietzsche said was the only way to experience the world, from my understanding. And he didn't think everyone could do this, probably an elite of people who are better than others.
		
		Postmodern philosophy is also rather stressful for someone looking for a moral guidance. I don't think Foucault and Deleuze and Heidegger will help someone who is scared of moral relativism to be of much help. Personally, my existential dread comes from issues such as moral relativism and moral nihilism. 
		
		Thank you so much for the super in-depth reply.

			Reading Nietzsche doesn't mean you have to agree with him on everything. As for his philosophy being for the select few, in my view that is because philosophy requires the courage to stare into the void, when most shy away from it to the comfort of the conventional. If you are truly committed to your moral convictions, in my opinion, they will survive a confrontation with Nietzsche and become stronger - they can be part of the value creation and opposition to nihilism.   
			
			
			In any case, if you ever find yourself interested in his work, I highly recommend the Nietzsche Podcast. https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-nietzsche-podcast/id1573808070

				I've found from reading Nietzsche that his seductive witty writing style makes it easy for unwary readers to get in over their heads. He liked to approach concepts from various perspectives, and his views also changed over time, so it sometimes appears that he has contradictory ideas about things (and people can cherry-pick from his ideas to support almost any view, it seems). He suffered from personal crisis at the end of his career, and his final works seem provocative.

		There are structural factors behind ressentiment. You can't just cry "Sour grapes!" and ignore the problem. Why do some people have this mentality of "sour grapes" and how can we address the problem?
		
		
		An anarchist could criticize the state monopoly on violence. What is more emasculating than not being allowed to defend yourself from sexual abuse?
		
		
		A feminist might call for abolishing the family. Better child care and more equal power between the genders could help women leave abusive relationships.
		
		
		A queer person might argue the problem is erotophobia. They might say if we want to stop the shame driving so much rage and hate then fight laws against public nudity.

			Yes, I agree there are structural factors, or forces, acting on individuals. It would be absurd to say that all forces must originate within and inside them separately. But also it would be absurd to say that all progressive forces must originate externally outside all individuals - where and how would that be?   
			
			
			If structural critiques are possible from all of these lenses - anarchist, feminist, queer - why could incel Nietzscheanism not be such a lens?   
			
			
			Left critical theorists assuming that their "transgressive" traditions of thought are the full extent of what it means to be critical - isn't that self-contradicting, since to be truly transgressive you would have to go against these traditions?

	I understand you mean well but I think your question is way off-base.

	Put in very simple power dynamic terms, men have more institutional power than women. They have more power to change their behavior than women do, but perceive less need to change their behavior than women do. In class terms, you could say the same thing of upper class versus lower class, and the solution to class oppression is not to be nicer to rich people. If you cater to the reactionary subjectivity of the group with more power, that just reinforces the power dynamic even more.

	Whenever you ask a group of people to give up some power, you get pushback. There have been massive antifeminist pushbacks every time women achieve societal power gains: voting, birth control, etc.. The way to move forward is not to cater to reactionaries, but to consolidate gains and last them out.

	I also think your perception is wrong and that you're engaging, subconsciously, in the opposite of cherry-picking, where you don't even notice all the positive advice offered because it's directed towards people as a whole not solely towards men. For example, "don't catcall" or "don't give unwanted compliments", a piece of negative advice often given to men. And this is followed by positive advice when people ask for it in good faith: compliments are great when it's over an aspect of their body that people can control. So telling a woman "I love those pants" is a humanizing compliment as opposed to "your ass looks great" which in most contexts can be pretty dehumanizing. However, men might not perceive this as positive advice, because it's equally applicable to all genders (men receive dehumanizing compliments much less than women do, but it's still bad).

	Men are socialized to be very thin-skinned about their place in society, If they're not placed front and center, they often feel like they're being discriminated against, whereas the least insecure, feminist-positive men are fine being on equal footing but not front and center.

	Another example is the advice "don't make a big deal out of opening doors for women". A lot of men get huffy about this and are like "well wtf are we supposed to do". The answer is just so obvious: be a decent human being and treat other people like human beings. Open doors when it makes sense to open doors for people. If someone is elderly or carrying a lot of stuff or moving slowly, spend a bit more effort to get to the door first to help them, no matter what gender you are. It's that simple!

	Conservatives have lots of positive advice aimed specifically at men, and push lots of male role models, but when you look at it more closely, all their positive advice involves treating women like shit in some kind of way. Whereas feminist positive advice involves treating *everyone* a bit better, and helping *everyone* not be so alienated, i**ncluding alienated women and non-men**. The media love to talk about lonely young white men, but who cares about lonely old women, right?

	One thing I'd also suggest looking at is conservative vs. self-identified progressive attitudes toward male victims. For example, male victims of sexual assault in Hollywood. Terry Cruise, Brendan Fraser, and Anthony Rapp came out about major cases of this in the last few years, and I saw them receive a lot of support from feminists and progressives. Whenever a boy in school is molested by a female teacher, the conservative/traditionalist reaction is "haha they were lucky" while the feminist/progressive reaction is "that's pedophilia and rape." Feminists and progressives typically try not to have double standards in this regard, whereas conservatives proudly hold up a double standard as the natural way of the world... and this double standard leads to a lot of male suffering as well as female suffering.

	Also, a loosely defined "Critical Theory" is not going to address this issue because it's, well, critical. This is not the Gentle Positive Encouragement Theory subreddit. You may be better off looking at subs or groups focusing on radical pedagogy or street epistemology where there'll be more hands-on advice about reaching people where they are, even people who have really reactionary views.

	As for incels, cult deradicalization is really the only paradigm that can help them. Inceldom is about way more than hating women: above all, they hate themselves, discourage each other from seeking therapy, and often encourage each other into murder and suicide. It's a literal death cult, but because it's decentralized and leaderless due to the internet distribution, it's not perceived that way by the general public.

		You hit on some points that I agree with but I disagree with your approach to the question.
		
		I feel like what you've outlined is a caricature of all men that doesn't capture the nuances or range of experiences men have. I'm not a reactionary. I'm a progressive and a feminist. I still experience a kind of loneliness that is gendered - not in a comparative, my-loneliness-is-worse-than-yours way, just in the sense that it emanates from similar conditions to that of other men.
		
		So many on the left just respond to these kinds of things by saying to just grow thicker skin. But the only tool that we have to do that, by default, is the same kind of toxic emotionally avoidant socialization we're supposed to also resist. How am I supposed to wrestle with my own issues if the answer is to just compare it to someone else who is a higher priority? All I can do is just listen to what others have to say about what my experience is *really* like and how I really should be fine.
		
		I don't agree with the class analogy, because the idea in a class struggle is to ultimately eradicate the class divide, whereas (with some ideological exceptions) the idea isn't to eradicate gender. And speaking of class - the people who are going to be the most vulnerable to right-wing rhetoric are going to be working people who don't have the free time to ponder gender issues in a sophisticated way, but who know that they don't feel good and need an explanation that they can process.
		
		It's great that feminist spaces seem to care more about some issues men face, like sexual assault. But I think it's reasonable for men to also want their other struggles to be listened to and not have to stand in comparison to the struggles of others to be understandable on their own terms.

			Yes, but the idea is to eradicate the gender *divide*, considering how this whole conversation started with the media moral panic over the political gender divide.

			This is the point where I'm gonna stop being charitable, because wow, do I hate this brand of leftism... "working class too stupid, need big man tell them what do!" This stuff can get academically complicated, but ultimately, it doesn't have to be. There are so many working class feminists and pro-feminists out there, and the people most powerful in pushing the new misogyny in our culture are the ultra rich.

					Patriarchy means that men are seen as social threats to nurturing spaces and women are seen as social threats to spaces of hierarchical power. What has aroused more threats and societal freakouts in modern history, men becoming nurses or women becoming doctors?
					
					Also, many women —  Black, working class, disabled, gender non-conforming, etc. — are very used to the experience of being treated as social threats by other women and men.
					
					Patriarchy also conditions men to not show vulnerability because that might show weakness. Whereas women are conditioned to perform vulnerability and weakness in some contexts and then mocked for this performance in other contexts. They're also conditioned *not* to show strength in many contexts because that's unfeminine and could paradoxically endanger them more by attracting hostile attention. Patriarchy assigns men harmful simple standards and assigns women confusing contradictory harmful standards impossible to ever meet.
					
					Men don't really *need* to understand women's gendered oppression to survive: it's optional for them. So they often imagine that women just can't face what they're facing. However, women grow up paying attention and empathizing with men's issues, putting themselves in the place of men, to the point where internalized misogyny often causes them to treat male suffering as much more important than female suffering.
					
					I've literally never read an account of male loneliness that I can't empathize with because it seemed *alien*. And the whole canon of literature and philosophy is like 95% men talking about loneliness, so I've definitely read a lot. But apparently, the opposite is quite common.

			>I don't know how helpful it is to look at them purely as reactionaries losing their privilege. This argument gets even weaker when you bring in the class element in my opinion since so many incels are disprivileged in this regard.
			
			It's not helpful looking at *anything* "purely", but they *are* absolutely reactionaries losing their privilege: they even explicitly define themselves this way. Their most common policy suggestion is that the government should step in to provide them wives. They're confused and very wrong about the amount of privilege they used to have — they share the common right-wing delusion that the patriarchy would have nestled them in a warm embrace circa 1950 — but that's absolutely how they see themselves.
			
			The only class element to inceldom is that [they're predominantly middle class](https://theconversation.com/incels-are-surprisingly-diverse-but-united-by-hate-163414). Some of them are super rich: look at Elliot Rodger.
			
			My argument isn't that they're not alienated by late capitalism. They are. We all are. But others who are alienated worse don't turn to the incel death cult for answers, and over-focusing on incels and catering to their demands and endless whining is pointless and misogynist. I've seen so many responses to my post from people who keep dismissing any incel-analogous women's pain and suffering because... well, we should be used to it I guess, and when we get lonely we typically don't mass murder, so why should anyone care?
			
			It's such a common pattern.
			
			* Men: "I have a problem as a man."
			* Women and non-men: "We also experience that problem in a slightly different way, and here are some methods we cope with it—"
			* Men: "—you're saying I should think and act like a woman. Ewww."
			
			And then that shuts down any useful dialogue.
			
			Incels don't need catering, they need honesty and reality reflected back to them, and their radicalization pipeline needs to be disrupted, which is a hard task because there's so much money being made off them and vested interest in keeping that pipeline flowing.

				The most obvious example to me is in the education system. Back in the 60s boys had a large gap in test scores over girls. Which the powers at be were ok with because everyone knew at the time that boys were just smarter than girls (despite this being obviously wrong given what we know today). The systemic advantages that boys enjoyed were systematically identified and dismantled, with the result being that girls gradually did better and better in schools, to the point where the educational achievement gap has reversed and in fact is now LARGER in favour of girls than it was for boys in the 60s. 
				
				So if it's about inequality, and the fix for girls then was identifying and dismantling systemic advantages that hurt girls, why are we not now identifying systemic advantages that hurt boys and dismantling them? Instead, crickets. There's a massive pro-girl cultural inertia and the teachers colleges are STILL pumping out new teachers who have a pro-girl attitude.  Those teachers are going to be in classrooms for the next 30 years so this isn't a ship that's going to get turned around in the next couple of decades.
				
				It's been shown that if you randomise and anonymise assignments for marking, girls get the same scores they got previously, whereas boys scores climb significantly (up to nearly what the girls get). If you show teachers pictures/video of normal kids engaging in normal behaviour, ask them to spot troublesome behaviours, then track their eye movements, they spend most of their time looking at the boys. Teachers are predisposed to mark boys down in assignments just because they are boys. They are predisposed to punish or discipline them more, just because they are boys. And  those things turn into a permanent academic advantage for girls after a decade or so in the school system. And that harms boys.
				
				Does that meet your threshold for inequality?

					No, because you're very wrong about this: I follow educational media, and the achievement gap for boys is a massive topic of discussion and there have been many institutionalized responses to it, including calls for a return to single-sex education (which can increase academic outcomes, but ultimately just kicks the socialization problems down the road).
					
					There have been tons of studies about the gender grading gap [and a lot of theories as to why it happens](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09645292.2023.2252620). However, blaming it all on "pro-girl" teachers is a psychological theory ignoring all the material and sociological conditions surrounding education and gendered labor. For example, why are so many primary teachers women? In the United States, the typical dynamic is that these teachers are underpaid and they're expected to nurture kids out of a kind of feminine empathy. Primary teaching, childcare and eldercare all gendered female, paid less, and not as attractive to men, who are socialized to be more competitive about salary.
					
					I've never seen any serious feminist laughing or ignoring the boy achievement gap. In fact, we typically call for more male teachers and jobs like teaching to become better paid and less gendered.

						Thankyou for your response. I was posting the facts as I see them but I am always open to more facts.
						
						> For example, why are so many primary teachers women? In the United States, the typical dynamic is that these teachers are underpaid and they're expected to nurture kids out of a kind of feminine empathy.
						
						I think there's also men being viewed with suspicion. Why is HE wanting to be around small children? I spent 25 years in a volunteer capacity with primary aged kids and I can you as the male unicorn there were a lot of times I got side eye, and I was also keenly aware that the first kid that made any claim about inappropriate touching was the end of my involvement.
						
						When a child is crying it's normalised and ok for a women to comfort them and hug them, when that's really not ok for a man todo since he's already 'schrodingers pedophile'.
						
						So while I agree that the salary is a real selector for men (women aren't considered to be failures working a shitty low paid job the way men are), there are other factors which tell men 'you're not supposed to be here'.
						
						> I've never seen any serious feminist laughing or ignoring the boy achievement gap. In fact, we typically call for more male teachers and jobs like teaching to become better paid and less gendered.

									YES!
									
									The Fear, including panic about pedophilia, is spread by conservative media. Teaching is low paid. Child rearing is ‘women’s work.’ The history of professional teaching has always been dominated by women, so men have not been ‘driven out’ of teaching. Men are a minority in teaching but principals are more likely to be male.
									
									We men have not been framed as abusers in either sense of that word. We have been violent and abusive, and the world has vaguely and slightly started to work on that. I’ve spent my life working on that project, pretty much, because I come from a long line of violent and abusive men.
									
									I think you have a skewed and unreal view of the world. Look at the subs you’ve joined here, man! These are misogynist spaces!

It's very meaningless, and I would like to find a non-hedonistic, non-religious, left wing alternative that grants meaning. Please consider that material conditions and the economy is not the only way to be alienated - one can be alienated existentially.

Capitalism already worships hedonism and art, and Contrapoint's videos honestly just agrees with that kind of capitalist hedonism (she just disagrees with capitalism as economics). Philosophytube also made a pro hedonism video, which disappointed me.

	My grandfathers were born around 1900, so from a world very different to this one. I am in my 50s, and come from a long line of military and professionally violent men. Manly men.

	Also men who were physically abusive to their families, and were often alcoholics. I know they got lots of sex, because my extended family is huge and I have many half-siblings. One of my grandfathers had 14 siblings.

	They were all very obviously lost and alienated, and not merely because of poverty.

	Incels and celebate monks are sort of the inverse of each other. Monks stay celebate on purpose because they reject hedonistic/materialist values in favor of spiritual/religious ones. Incels are upset because they can't have sex, despite trying, because they can't see any values other than hedonistic/materialist ones. I don't think they're the same at all, but there's an interesting disjunction there.

	>I think there is an issue on the left that forgets that every society in the past has had a "monk" caste, men that weren't supposed to have sex and were more isolated, yet were respected by society. The modern equivalent of this is incels or hikikomoris, but it is a group that is mocked and not given any meaningful solution for a need for greater meaning.

	This wildly misunderstands "monk castes," incels, or both. Your conflation of incels and alienated men is also problematic.

	Incels are not just men who don't have sex or are alienated; they are a hate group ideology built around hating women for *not giving* them sex, and hating their idea of (cis-het) men who are having sex. The ideology is violent and has been the impetus for [mass murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Incel-related_violence).

	In short, I do not think incels are your average "lost man" who is just needing a purpose in life.

	I'm glad you're looking for resources on this, but please be careful talking about/engaging with inceldom from the vantage you appear to have at the moment.

	I really wish there was good material on this sort of stuff.

	So there is a decent amount of Freudo-Marxist and Frankfurt school material on similar issues. I sum it up as "Fascism is capitalism in crisis and fascists are men in crisis." People with disproportionate shame such as victims of child abuse are easy prey for cults which vent the shame as rage. In addition, cultures of violence can be appealing because self-harm can help penetrate through dissociation and because feeling punished can feel better than feeling ashamed. But I have trouble finding material looking for structural solutions to the problem.

	My own two cents are abolish the family, abolish prisons and abolish the car. Cribbing from a manifesto I wrote out of spite yesterday after reading "Healing from Hate."

	If you believe the authoritarian family unit normalizes child abuse driving the shame-based rage of many violent groups then family abolitionism is an obvious step. Better child care, maternity leave and other feminist provisions are essential to fixing the imbalance in power which family violence often exploits. Fixing power imbalances gives the power for the abused to leave.

	Prison abolitionism is an obvious next step if you believe prisons force men into white supremacist gangs and other hate groups. And also, prison is humiliating and emasculates underprivileged men. We don't need a shame based system of retributive justice.

	Abolish the car is sensible if you want to reduce social isolation. People who jump hate groups need social connections to rely on so they can get it. Strong inter-class connections also break down stereotypes and hate cults use to divide us. We don't need to artificially subsidized the automobile industry. We can introduce public transit and densify cities and fight urban sprawl.

	I have found most of my ideas reading autobiographies, sociology and political psychology and have only started reading critical studies. But family abolitionism is heavy in feminist and queer material. Prison abolitionism is heavy in mad and black material. Not really sure where to find the most anticar material other than in green material.

	So, their both statist but I liked Kathleen M. Blee for hate group sociology and Bob Altemeyer for political psychology. Christian Picciolini and Tony McAleer have written some of the most popular autobiographies by former members of hate groups but I feel I really need to read more into this area. I am looking forward to reading Sammy Rangel's autobiography and also interested in Usama Hasan's thoughts on the topic of hate groups.

	This area is one where there's a lot of new work. I'm a researcher, and I'm sort of working in the space, trying to think about socially transformative ideas and media that might target young men. Living in Australia, in the wake of increased consciousness about bullying, sexual assault, and gender nonconformity -- but also in the stew of online 'manosphere' stuff like Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate -- people are talking a lot about how to reach young men with really compelling ideas.

	One that I've run across in my research is Gunter Swodoba, the founder of the Making Good Men Great project: [https://www.goodmengreat.com/](https://www.goodmengreat.com/) He's got a book out and some other stuff, but he's working on new projects. His approach is grounded in therapy, but it specifically talks to men about how patriarchy and misogyny negatively affects them. That is, he advocates for forms of therapy and counselling that specifically address gender theory and critiques of patriarchy. 

	I find it interesting though because when I was younger, leftist thinking was associated with really attractive male role models. I grew up in the US, and as I drifted leftward in my thinking, I was totally galvanised by images of Che Guevara as well as his writings, in addition to figures like Lenin, Trotsky, Saul Bellow, Huey P. Newton... Their writings were poweful, but so was the image of revolutionary masculinity. I wonder if younger people today are too likely to see political progressives as people not like themselves (but see Subcomandante Marcos in works like his collected speeches or the late David Graeber, author of Debt: The First 5000 Years. 

	I guess what I'm saying is that I always found outwardly focused revolutionary men to be really motivating, on an intellectual level, but also on the level of implicitly defining alternatives to heterosexist masculinity. The idea that meaning needs to be about self-cultivation and not social change is part of the problem of late capitalism: society is f@#$ed, but don't think about it and just learn mindfulness and repeat self-help pablum. Or get on a prescription.

	A proportion of young men feeling (sexually) inadequate and becoming depressed is a phenomenon that has existed for millennia. It's just a stage of life that people aren't aware of until they enter it, so it feels like it's some new problem with society, but it isn't.

	This means that there is a demographic of young men who feel outcast, desperate for attention, recognition, empowerment, enlightenment, community and a clear path to success that seems otherwise unachievable. It's also always been ripe for economic exploitation by grifters, criminals, politicians and cultists: they are easily swayed by those who pretend to be ideal role models, pretend to be friends or allies, allow them to shift the blame entirely to others, provide them a community they fit into and/or promise them the status, power and sex that they crave. They might sometimes achieve these things, but at the cost of becoming like those who exploited them and perpetuating the cycle of exploitation.

	What *is* new is that the internet created the space and opportunity for communities that didn't promise success, but instead a collective recognition of inevitable failure and ideas of "enlightenment" that purport to deconstruct social narratives. These ideas and communities converge under the names "incel" and "blackpill."

	It also created more opportunities to directly target and exploit these young men too, which is where "redpill" and the "manosphere" comes in. This is why it all seems to be so closely related to self-help grifters, alt-right politics, crypto etc.

	So why do these men feel alienated by the left?

	Well, that's for two reasons. First, some misguided sects of the left have spun off into misandry and quite literally *have* sought to alienate men (mostly white men) in an ill-advised attempt to dismantle the patriarchy.

	But secondly, and more importantly, it's because the narrative that the left has "no answer" is being actively pushed and spread by "redpill" grifters, politicians, criminals and cultists.

	The left only doesn't have an apparent answer right now because it does not currently engage in the same level of grifting and economic exploitation of these young men, and there is no appetite to do so because it is antithetical to progressivism. Grifting is the domain of the political right, where natural hierarchy and exploitation is seen as virtuous.

	The left's actual solution? Investment in education, community, diversity and mental health support, promotion of sexual liberty, destruction of gender roles and a general dismantling of hierarchy and the patriarchy. If these young men had grown up in a society without patriarchy and strong gender distinctions, they would not be so susceptible to hierarchical exploitation.

		I don't think it's misandry so much as feminism having gone completely libfem and abandoned the idea of an egalitarian sexual utopia. Hear me out:
		
		I'm a not-very-attractive autistic male. My mom is a patriarchal Jehovah's Witness and my dad was a domestic violence/child abuse social worker for the Navy during Tailhook times (retired dril sergeant). So my dad had the second wave feminism job about how you're not allowed to rape your wife anymore. When I eventually read Andrea Dworkin, it was like, these are obviously the truest things that have ever been written down. I also got the shit bullied out of me, and I'm black (Afro-German), so it made the idea of "dominance" uncomfortable. Audre Lorde came up with "Afro-German" and was against BDSM. In adolescence I listened to things like Propagandhi, with the song "Refusing to be a Man" based on John Stoltenberg's book.
		
		So I'm a rare unicorn male who agrees with the most man-hating extreme feminism. I can tell you that it's not attractive AT ALL. The main problem is that WOMEN don't *wholeheartedly* agree with Andrea Dworkin. Undoing our socialization and changing what counts as attractive for both sexes *at the same time* is the fundamental problem.
		
		If I wasn't legitimately traumatized into agreement with the man-haters, the two paths available to me would be inceldom and trans. After all, my ex-wife said being with me was "like dating a lesbian." Indeed, The Tragedy of Heterosexuality is a good book. How to have sex with people and like them at the same time?
		
		But egalitarianism doesn't just happen. It's a reverse dominance hierarchy. The book Hierarchy in the Forest is about this. Something actually has to happen to our value system that would punish Chads.
		
		It's not that men can't bear to hear the truth about themselves. Once we have and we're prepared to change, women aren't prepared to reward that behavior. The loser men under patriarchy should be feminism's natural allies, but women can't stop thinking of them as, well, losers. We can tell.
		
		What kind of turbo-simp behavior is it to be more feminist than women? Libfems and Chads are aligned. What's the difference between sex positivity and Hugh Hefner? Who wants a boyfriend that cries?
		
		You could frame it as an issue of male sexual entitlement, but it's also a practical question of how to change cultural. Maybe radical feminism shouldn't *have* to offer men an incentive to play along, but it takes two people cooperating to change sexual practices. If women just refuse, then we can either try to become Chads and become abusive that way or become transbians and become abusive that way. Or just leave women alone and give up, but that's not a reasonable political message for a movement that's trying to win.

			You do not need to be attractive to *everyone*. There is no *everyone*. Women are not a monolith.
			
			Monolithic attitudes are a big part of sexual entitlement: the idea that attractiveness is a scale that measures the same for everyone and certain qualities will get you laid with *anyone* at any time.
			
			Nobody can get laid by anyone at any time. It's not real. People fuck when they want to and they don't when they don't, and that *changes* all the time. Sometimes the same person who would have fucked anything that moved 5 minutes ago now doesn't want to fuck at all.
			
			Not everyone is a good person to fuck either, and especially not everyone is suitable for a relationship, both in general and specifically with you. Compatibility and timing are always key.
			
			All I hear in your comment is frustration that you do not have a way to be certain you can fuck who you want to fuck, which is a problem of insecurity.
			
			The solution for anyone in that situation is to *stop trying to solve sexual attraction* (because it's self-involved and offputting) and develop a personality that is actually pleasant for other people to be around. Then, the *opportunity* to have sex will arise (with some people, and you don't get to decide who) and you won't have put them off.
			
			That's it. That's the sexual utopia. Not giving a fuck and respecting other people's choices.

				Notice how *patronizing* that was. You're making the pedantic point that, gee, women are not a monolith. As if that wasn't heavily implied by my own comment: if I'm saying "women" don't like Andrea Dworkin, I'm speaking casually and logically implying at least two categories of women.
				
				What you've done is almost the rhetorical equivalent of saying "not all men" when confronted with patriarchy. No, but there is certainly a point where emphasizing that distorts any discussion of the larger societal patterns. No, not all women hate Andrea Dworkin, but she's mighty unpopular. This is a fact in need of explanation. In her own writing overcoming the socialization to accept a lesser standard of dignity is identified as a major obstacle to feminism. It's awkward and self-serving for me to bring this up as a man, but I think it's revealing that you're denying the very idea that women have any work to do to make their own vision realizable in practice.
				
				True story: women used to argue about whether asking men to sexually dominate them was perhaps hurting the cause:
				
				[https://janiceraymond.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SexLiberals.pdf](https://janiceraymond.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SexLiberals.pdf)
				
				But you're saying men just need to "develop pleasant personalities", which is of course undefined. But this is a real social phenomenon:
				
				[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q3rPzzZJLs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q3rPzzZJLs)
				
				Saying "compabibility is key" is begging the question, which is precisely whether feminism would require standards of compatibility to change. Even Meghan Murphy hangs out with right-wing dudes. LOL!
				
				To achieve this utopia, what would women have to do differently? The fact that your answer appears to be "nothing" is why men can't take it seriously.
				
				These issues didn't spring into existence because of my personal level of insecurity. But you're quite avoidant of acknowledging them.

					I don't agree with the whole "not all men" thing precisely because it is entirely monolithic in its thinking. If you need to justify the idea that someone can't attack your argument for generalizing people into a stereotype i.e. saying "not all X" for *any* X, then there is probably something seriously wrong with your idea.
					
					>denying the very idea that women have any work to do to make their own vision realizable in practice.
					
					There is no *women* to have a vision. There is not one single vision, there are many individuals, some who have clear visions, some who do not, all of whome are unique. How can I be making any kind of statement about something that doesn't even exist as far as I can see?
					
					You say you are speaking casually and logically, but what would you say if you were *not* speaking casually? When you say women, which women are you actually talking about? Are you talking about 99% of women? Or is it 51%? When you say women, is this always the same women?
					
					So, are you really speaking casually, or are you just speaking your mind?

	Wouldn’t the monk class of Anglo-American society be…monks or, in the Catholic tradition, priests? Also, to claim that every society has had a monk class feels ahistorical.

	Ultimately, while the loneliness crisis is a legitimate concern that comes from a public disinvestment from community centers, libraries, and other shared social spaces (as well as the increasing privatization of third spaces), the base of inceldom is misogyny. 

	It is a form of loneliness that very crudely commodifies women and assigns them a value on the supposed sexual marketplace, and then concedes how those same men that commodify said women are low in value (by their own metric). From there, it laments how feminism has empowered women to subvert gender roles and longs for the the mythic days when men like them were entitled to “high-value” women. 

	While we can validate the feelings that surround loneliness, to validate the interpretation of those feelings (“my loneliness is caused by third wave feminism and progressive politics”) is dangerous for women and femmes and otherwise not egalitarian.

	Men do not experience some unique special breed of existential alienation distinct from what women experience. If they want to solve their problem first they need to stop assuming women don’t ever suffer from anything like what they suffer too. There’s no “male alienation problem” specifically; there’s a trend of choosing misogyny/oppression plus some general alienation all genders are experiencing. If they choose misogyny that is their fault and they need to fix it or have it fixed for them without coddling or accommodations. If it’s just the latter then they can join in and try to build a more sociable less capitalist/atomized society along with the rest of us.

Thriving interest or hobby communities for younger people that you can just sign up to after uni aren’t really a thing. They do exist, but they’re not huge. Community sports is huge though. I think this decline in community groups is ascribed to neoliberalism in general. This is a problem everyone faces, not just men. 

	Incels (and femcels) are different to lonely humans so I don’t really think it’s the same problem all in one. 

	Incel memes, subculture and their group delusions similar to the gangstalking cult are very odd, even extremely cringe, and I think monks have more dignity tbh. Femcels seem a bit less overtly violent and crazy but no less un self-aware and odd. At least they’ve all found their people. :/

	The problem is that the left is not attractive to them 

	All the approaches I have seen the left takes are transactional and shameful 

	If one side is telling you that you can build yourself from the ground up and whether you make it or not is on you

	And the other side is telling you that you need to repent and bend over backwards because you are privileged and it doesn’t matter how hard you try your value will be attached to what you can offer to women and society 

	It really is a no brainer

		I guess I was referring to existential alienation. Men lost without a greater purpose, perhaps people who feel lost in relativism and hedonism, so to speak. Not everyone is going to find the pursuit of individual whims or pursuit of art as the highest good as fulfilling. I think people like that (and I admit I myself might belong in this existentially lost category) need some kind of greater goal that is seen as objective.
		
		I don't think post-scarcity society is going to solve existential dread and alienation. Just because we will have the free time to produce whatever we want does not mean everyone will find creating art on your own terms as fulfilling.   
		Could you link me to where Marx discusses solutions to alienation?

			Absolutely,  you can Google Karl Marx's theory of alienation to find summaries and commentary which sometimes is a good way to start before diving into the text its self but Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 would be the text. 
			
			Also, I'm growing increasingly into a Hegelian and The Phenomenology of Spirit is a valuable read but, Hegel is notoriously hard to read so definitely starting to read some translated summaries are necessary. 
			
			I found this to be a good article on the subject, https://www.internationalmagz.com/articles/marxs-main-contribution-to-the-theory-of-alienation.
			
			It mentions the text i listed above with additional references. 
			
			I think this might send you off in the right direction.

	Men who lack purpose lack fulfilling work and community. Fulfilling work is the responsibility of government + economy, and ideally would include a universal basic income to give individuals true autonomy over their work and allow everyone to be entrepreneurs / tenured professors. Community is correlated with fulfilling work, and also things like walkable cities and community spaces (eg. the "third space" concept).

	As for incel, which literally means involuntary celibacy, the literal solution to that is just to legalize prostution. Honestly would be way healthier than loners just jerking off to porn and losing touch with reality. Sex is only a big deal when one isn't getting any, and it's not healthy for society to have large swaths of sexually frustrated men.

* 🟩 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 0 _(2024-01-31 01:46:19)_

	In a left-wing society you would need to promote women to understand why they help to create the alienated man. Not how to further alienate men by pretending they are the problem. Pretending the men are the problem is a sign of female privilege.

		This forum isn’t related to American politics. It’s broadly Marxist, particularly critical theory and the Frankfurt school. The sidebar explains what that is.
		
		It’d be better to read that instead of assuming we’re all mainstream Americans.

			Didn’t assume you’re all mainstream Americans. I considered the likelihood of people reading the comment being from the US quite high. Got the impression that many on political subs are.
			
			The solution to ”incels and alienated men” is to stop people from becoming ”incels” or ”alienated”, and give treatment to those who are. Doesn’t matter if you’re marxist or non-marxist. I explained a substantial part of how to do that. A left-wing solution, marxist or non-marxist, would be to make sure such programs are properly funded. The current situation, reflected in the article the poster above referred to, is to a large extent due to unwillingness by politicians in charge to do that. We know how to improve the situation, but politicians don’t want us to.

		I'm sorry, but I can't tell if your response is sarcastic. It could be taken as mocking the idea that a left-wing world is an unrealistic utopia?

		* 🟧 **[2012Aceman](https://www.reddit.com/user/2012Aceman)** ⬆️ 0 _(2024-01-30 15:51:04)_

			It's less that a left-wing world is an unrealistic utopia, more the idea that "the Revolution is the beginning, not the end". Post-revolution you're going to start uncovering a LOT more problems. New opportunities will breed new opportunists. And I don't like the presumption that everything will be "solved" by overthrowing the establishment.
