"This is not a humanitarian crisis. This is the worst of what humanity is capable of, and it's entirely all man-made," says Haj-Hassan.

"having to tell a father or a mother that their entire family, their lifelong partner and all of their children have just been killed and you weren't able to resuscitate them.
It's something that was very difficult to experience and something that I hope I never have to experience again.
Frankly, it's something that I just feel ashamed that we're still talking about seven months into this.
It's such a stark representation of our failure, of our failure as humanity, that this is not a humanitarian crisis.
This is the worst of what humanity is capable of and it's entirely all man-made.
And when you witness it firsthand, it's an unbearable injustice."
