## Can you recomend me any large one or two volume books on the History of Western Philosophy? I want to better understand how modern philosophy came to be. Thanks!

	In video form, if you're interested, I'd recommend all of Bryan magees programmes, they're up on YouTube. There he interviews different philosophers on different eras and or philosophies throughout history. His 1986 series in particular goes through the history all the way from Plato. Super enjoyable, magee's great at clarifying complex subjects.

		I‚Äôd add to this, Arthur Holmes‚Äô lectures on YouTube are great, from what I‚Äôve heard of them so far. And he has a super endearing way of saying, ‚Äúyou see?‚Äù Every other phrase. I smile every time he says it.

		Will Durant is massively under appreciated imo. There are lots of very nice segments of his audiobook on youtube read by what sounds like a sexy professor and who's definetely not Durant himself because if you ever heard him speak you know he sounds like british Walrus that's drowning on its own saliva.
		Anyway, his work is an insightful mix of history and philosophy and beautiful prose in its own right. Can definitely recommend him over Bertrand Russell.

	(Moved this so it doesn‚Äôt get downvoted along with my other answer because I think it‚Äôs more helpful) There is *A Critical History of Western Philosophy* by D.J. O‚ÄôConnor (1985), which is only around 600 pages in paperback, as opposed to the Russell‚Äôs ~900, and in fact *covers* the likes of Russell and Moore, what with its being 40 years more up-to-date than the other, and more accurate. The last two I can think of are *The Oxford History of Western Philosophy*, edited by Anthony Kenny, published in 2000, which is more of an edited volume with six contributors, and breaks the history down into six sections starting, of course, with ‚ÄúAncient Philosophy,‚Äù and ending with ‚ÄúPolitical Philosophy,‚Äù however Anthony Kenny also published a 4-book series on the same subject which, together, provide one of, if not *the* most thorough and accessible single-author narratives of their kind. In 2010, *A New History of Western Philosophy* was published in an omnibus edition containing *Ancient Philosophy* (2004), *Medieval Philosophy* (2005), *The Rise of Modern Philosophy* (2006), and *Philosophy in the Modern World* (2007), in a single 1000 page volume which is surprisingly affordable, as far as Oxford UP academic books go, at ~$30 for the paperback (I‚Äôm sure you could find it used on eBay for less). Keep in mind that the Kenny solo-work is used at the undergraduate level and may not get as in-depth on the theoretical side of things as some might prefer, *and* that I haven‚Äôt read the whole thing cover-to-cover, instead cherry-picking sections of personal interest to me, or concerning specific periods/thinkers as assigned by the professor of the survey class I bought it for (I‚Äôll get around to reading the whole thing one of these days, but being a PhD student means I either have time to read for pleasure, *or* to sleep, but not both lmao), but the chapters I *have* read were informative, easy to follow, and well-written. YMMV but hopefully one of these helps!

	If you're happy with tomes, I'd say try A. W. Moore's *The Evolution of Modern Metaphysics* which covers from Descartes to more recent times. He's a brilliant and clear writer.

		>well-regarded
		
		I'm sorry, but no, it's not. In fact, it's pretty much the most biased and/or ill-informed book on the history of philosophy you can get. I seriously doubt, it would still be published, if Russell's name could not be smeared on the cover in big, fat letters - and I even doubt, it would have been published at all, if it was written by a lesser known author.
		
		>is considered the gold-standard, at least by the professors I‚Äôve posed essentially the same question to.
		
		Yeah, well, send them my regards and ask them, if they ever read it.

				The typical concerns with Russell's *History* are not with it being boring or dense -- indeed, even in generally critical reviews he is often praised for his accessible style. Rather, the typical concerns with it are with the quality of his interpretations, which are, in most cases, widely thought to distort and misrepresent the philosophers he is commenting on.
				
				A retrospective is available from Wahl's "The Reception of Russell's *A History of Western Philosophy*" (in *J Bertrand Russell Studies* 39).
				
				Wahl:
				
				* When I began looking at reviews of Russell‚Äôs History of Western Philosophy I was expecting that most of the professional philosophers
				would give negative reviews, while more popular venues would have
				more positive reviews. Russell‚Äôs book, after all, sold quite well and has
				considerably more entertainment value than comparable histories of
				philosophy. The work was also mentioned among others by the Nobel
				Prize committee. Nonetheless, what I found was far more critical than
				I had expected, both in the popular press and in the philosophical
				journals...
				
				* [For instance, Weiss]  criticized Russell for relying ‚Äútoo much and
				without sufficient acknowledgement on secondary and tertiary
				sources such as Britannica, the Cambridge History, and Gibbon.‚Äù This
				is a theme one finds in many of the reviews. Weiss goes on to praise
				Russell‚Äôs treatments of Leibniz and Bergson and also the long discussion of Locke. He then returns: ‚ÄúBut it would be hard to find a more
				incompetent account than Russell‚Äôs presentation of Parmenides and
				Kant and of the metaphysics of Plato, Aristotle, and Hegel.‚Äù
				
				Wahl goes through a number of reviews of the work, I mention Gueroult's as Gueroult is among the most celebrated 20th century scholars of the history of modern philosophy:
				
				* Gueroult, in 1954, reviewed the French translation by H√©l√®ne Kern. There is no criticism
				sandwich here. Gueroult briskly lists many remarks from the work
				which indicate distortions, oversimplifications or other mischaracterizations of the philosophers‚Äô work, focusing particularly on the remarks concerning modern philosophers. He too adds a list (much of
				it overlapping with LeRoy‚Äôs) of omitted French philosophers, and
				ends with the very negative remark that the translation was a waste of
				time.

				I don‚Äôt know other books with that same scope. But I do know that one sucks and fails to reach the promises it has. Russell has been criticized for not understanding many philosophers he describes, and omitting others. Hegel and Bergson he has been criticized for getting completely wrong, Heidegger is omitted, and so on. As I understand it, he gets correct those philosophers that he respects more, and ignores others.

					To be fair I think he omits Heidegger because he was writing it during WWII and Heidegger was a literal Nazi. People criticize Habermas for engaging with Gadamer‚Äôs work on hermeneutics and phenomenology when it is almost wholly derivative of Heidegger‚Äôs, but if memory serves, that was *also* an effort to make the same arguments without having to acknowledge or be associated with Heidegger, similarly to how Martin‚Äôs students and contemporaries practically *all* jumped to distance themselves and their work from him/his. I‚Äôm not saying I know for sure that was Russell‚Äôs reason for ignoring him, but given the period of time in which that book was written/published, and the absolute shellacking his country took from the Nazis, it doesn‚Äôt seem like too much of a stretch‚Ä¶I could be wrong tho

						That‚Äôs fair enough (I still think Heidegger is too important to ignore, even if the treatment would have been harsh), but Russell still butchers many philosophers

		Hijacking this comment just to say that A.C. Grayling published within the last few years a History of Philosophy which I personally enjoyed and used to get into the discipline, and which I've seen recommended more often than Russell's book now.

		* üüß **[SashaBorodin](https://www.reddit.com/user/SashaBorodin)** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 2 _(2024-01-12 10:12:15)_

			Have heard positive things about Grayling‚Äôs *The History of Philosophy*, I have been working on a paper about militarizing nationalism and threat-inflation in presidential rhetoric, unilateral executive use of force, and the implications of the Age of Terror for the theory of just war and the ideal of the ‚Äústatesman.‚Äù I‚Äôm a moral-political philosophy nerd, so of course I found a way to incorporate some John Rawls (*The Law of Peoples*) into an assignment for a class on the American Presidency, but anyway, one of the *many* other books I read for source material was his 2009 book *Liberty in the Age of Terror: A Defence of Civil Society and Enlightenment Values*, which was fascinating and extremely relevant. 
			
			I have this very inefficient habit when it comes to term papers of reading anywhere from 10-15 entire books prior to even *starting* a given assignment in an attempt to understand my topic from every possible angle‚Äîand thats not including the journal articles I mine from their bibliographies and *also* at least skim to make sure I‚Äôm not trying to reinvent the wheel, since the rubrics always stipulate that our term/final exam papers should make an original contribution to the literature on the subject, so I end up reading for like 2-3 weeks straight just to write a 10-15 page paper that has a 3-4 page bibliography of which *maybe* half are actually cited in-text, and the rest included because they informed my writing and in case I borrow an idea, argument, or turn-of-phrase from one or more of them without realizing (I am Autistic and have a tendency toward echolalia, which might look like plagiarism if uncited, so I use a ‚Äúbetter safe than sorry‚Äù rule when deciding which sources make the cut). I know I don‚Äôt *have* to become an expert on every topic I write a major assignment about, but I‚Äôm a perfectionist and master procrastinator, and if I‚Äôm reading something relevant to a project, I can tell myself I‚Äôm ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù without having to actually start writing lol). Anyway, I have a lot of respect for Grayling‚Äôs work, so I‚Äôll add that one to my list!

		Downvoted pretty heavily, which is somewhat understandable, but I'll add my vote here that Russell is a fine choice if one goes into it recognizing that it's not the be all end all of history here. It's Russell mixing it up with the "greats" and it's written in a way that invites the reader to engage with the works he is talking about and his own interpretation.  I actually find there is something some folks under appreciate about the work, at least today: it's a chance for readers, who aren't necessarily scholars, to find fault with Russell's interpretations and learn what doing philosophy can actually be like. I think, like, Kenny's, A New History of Western Philosophy, is definitely better to get a sense of what the "greats" thought, but that's not the only way to get into the history of philosophy. Sometimes it's nice to be motivated and learn how to engage and see how big names thought about things.

			**THANK YOU!** I wish I‚Äôd been able to articulate this, I feel like some people just can‚Äôt pass up an opportunity to go ‚Äú*Actually*, blah blah blah, how could you be *so* stupid?‚Äù I guess it makes them feel superior? I feel like we philosophy nerds should be trying to lift one another up, not jumping on every opportunity to tear each other down, I appreciate the positive spin! If I got an assignment to engage with an author or authors who had attempted a comprehensive history of western philosophy, I‚Äôd probably choose to critique the Russell by comparing and contrasting it to the Kenny (in case this post comes up on Google when someone is looking for research paper assignments).
