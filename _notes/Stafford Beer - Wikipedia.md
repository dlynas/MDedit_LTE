## Biography\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")\]

### Early life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Early life")\]

Beer was born in [Putney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putney "Putney"), London in 1927. His father was William John Beer, chief statistician at [Lloyd's Register of Shipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_Register "Lloyd's Register"), who shared a birthday with his mother, Doris Ethel Beer.<sup id="cite_ref-Rosenhead_Beer_obit_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-Rosenhead_Beer_obit-3">[3]</a></sup> At age 17 Stafford Beer was expelled from [Whitgift School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitgift_School "Whitgift School"). He enrolled for a degree in philosophy at [University College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London "University College London") before leaving to join the army as a Gunner in the [Royal Artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Artillery "Royal Artillery") in 1944. He soon received [commissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_(document) "Commission (document)"), first in the [Royal Fusiliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Fusiliers "Royal Fusiliers"), and then as a [company commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_commander "Company commander") in the [9th Gurkha Rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9_Gorkha_Rifles "9 Gorkha Rifles"). Beer served in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), staying there until 1947, when he returned to England and was assigned to the Human factors Branch of [Operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research "Operations research") at the [War Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Office "War Office"). In 1949, he was demobilised, having reached the rank of captain.<sup id="cite_ref-Tel_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-Tel-4">[4]</a></sup>

Beer did not use his given first name "Anthony", instead preferring his middle name of “Stafford.” His younger brother Ian also shared this middle name. When Ian was sixteen, Beer persuaded his brother to sign a document promising not to use “Stafford” as part of his name because Beer “wanted the ‘copyright’ of \[the name\] Stafford Beer.”<sup id="cite_ref-Pickering_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-Pickering-5">[5]</a></sup>

### United Steel\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: United Steel")\]

In 1956 he joined [United Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Steel_Companies "United Steel Companies") and persuaded the management to fund an operational research group, the Department of Operations Research and Cybernetics, which he headed. This was based in Cybor House, and they installed a [Ferranti Pegasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Pegasus "Ferranti Pegasus") computer, the first in the world dedicated to management cybernetics.<sup id="cite_ref-Cabezas_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-Cabezas-6">[6]</a></sup>

### SIGMA\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: SIGMA")\]

In 1961 he left United Steel to start an operational research consultancy in partnership with [Roger Eddison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Eddison "Roger Eddison") called SIGMA (Science in General Management). Beer left SIGMA in 1966 to work for a SIGMA client, the [International Publishing Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPC_Media "IPC Media") (IPC). He left IPC in 1970 to work as an independent consultant, focusing on his growing interest in social systems.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Cybersyn\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Cybersyn")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/CyberSyn-render-106.png/250px-CyberSyn-render-106.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CyberSyn-render-106.png)

[Project Cybersyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn "Project Cybersyn") was an early form of computational [economic planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_planning "Economic planning").

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Leon_Trotsky_in_exile.webp/159px-Leon_Trotsky_in_exile.webp.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Leon_Trotsky_in_exile.webp)

Leon Trotsky’s critique of the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") influenced Beer’s shifting political views and the design of the Cybersyn model

In mid-1971, Beer was approached by [Fernando Flores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Flores "Fernando Flores"), then a high-ranking member of the Chilean Production Development Corporation ([CORFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORFO "CORFO")) in the newly elected [socialist government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile_under_Allende "Chile under Allende") of [Salvador Allende](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende "Salvador Allende"), for advice on applying his cybernetic theories to the management of the state-run sector of the [Chilean economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chile "Economy of Chile").<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

This led to Beer's involvement in the never-completed [Cybersyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersyn "Cybersyn") project, which aimed to use computers and a [telex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telex "Telex")\-based communication network to allow the government to maximise production while preserving the autonomy of workers and lower management.

Beer also was reported to have read and been influenced by [Leon Trotsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky "Leon Trotsky")'s critique of the [Soviet bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenklatura "Nomenklatura").<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Although Cybersyn was abandoned after Allende's death during the [Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet "Augusto Pinochet") [coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_coup_of_1973 "Chilean coup of 1973") in 1973, Beer continued to work in the Americas, consulting for the governments of [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), [Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay "Uruguay") and [Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela "Venezuela").

### Later activity\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Later activity")\]

In the mid-1970s, Beer moved to mid-[Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales "Wales") where he lived in an almost austere style, developing strong interests in poetry and art. In the 1980s he established a second home on the west side of downtown [Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto "Toronto") and lived part of the year in both residences. He was a visiting professor at almost 30 universities and received an earned higher doctorate (DSc) from the [University of Sunderland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sunderland "University of Sunderland") and honorary doctorates from the [University of Leeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leeds "University of Leeds"), the [University of St. Gallen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_St._Gallen "University of St. Gallen"), and the [University of Valladolid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Valladolid "University of Valladolid"). He was president of the World Organization of Systems and Cybernetics.

### Falcondale Collection\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Falcondale Collection")\]

[Falcondale House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcondale_House "Falcondale House")

In July 1994 Beer ran a residential course at the [Falcondale Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcondale_House "Falcondale House") in [Lampeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampeter "Lampeter"). Nine sessions were recorded as a video learning resource, and are collectively known as the Falcondale collection. They are available [online](http://opendata.ljmu.ac.uk/6/) at the Data Repository of [Liverpool John Moores University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_John_Moores_University "Liverpool John Moores University").<sup id="cite_ref-ljmu_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-ljmu-10">[10]</a></sup> The sessions covered art, science and philosophy as well as the practical application of cybernetics in society, government, community, management and business. Transcripts were made of the discussions and are also available from the same repository.<sup id="cite_ref-ljmu_10-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-ljmu-10">[10]</a></sup>

### Family life\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Family life")\]

He was married twice, in 1947 to Cynthia Hannaway, and in 1968 to Sallie Steadman. His partner for the last twenty years of his life was [Allenna Leonard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allenna_Leonard "Allenna Leonard"), a fellow cybernetician. Beer had five sons and two daughters, one of whom is Vanilla Beer, an artist and essayist.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

### Management cybernetics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Management cybernetics")\]

According to Jackson (2000) "Beer was the first to apply cybernetics to management, defining cybernetics as the _science of effective organization_". In the 1960s and early 1970s "Beer was a prolific writer and an influential practitioner" in [management cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_cybernetics "Management cybernetics"). It was during that period that he developed the [viable system model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model "Viable system model"), to diagnose the faults in any existing organizational system. In that time [Forrester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester "Jay Wright Forrester") invented [systems dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_dynamics "Systems dynamics"), which "held out the promise that the behavior of whole systems could be represented and understood through modeling the dynamical feedback process going on within them".<sup id="cite_ref-Mich_2000_12-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-Mich_2000-12">[12]</a></sup>

### Cybersyn\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Cybersyn")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/70/Cybersyn_control_room.jpg/240px-Cybersyn_control_room.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cybersyn_control_room.jpg)

[Cybersyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersyn "Cybersyn") operations room, 1972

During the [administration of Salvador Allende in Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Salvador_Allende "Presidency of Salvador Allende"), in the early 1970s, Beer was closely involved with a visionary project, [Cybersyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersyn "Cybersyn"), to apply his cybernetic theories in government. The project's ultimate goal was to create a network of computers and communications equipment that would support the management of the state-run sector of Chile's economy; at its core would be an operations room where government managers could view important information about economic processes in real time, formulate plans of action, and transmit advice and directives to managers at plants and enterprises in the field.<sup id="cite_ref-RE_13-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-RE-13">[13]</a></sup> However, consistent with cybernetic principles and the ideals of the Allende government, its designers aimed to preserve worker and lower-management autonomy instead of implementing a top-down system of centralised control. The system used a network of about 500 [telex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telex "Telex") machines located at enterprises throughout the country and in government offices in [Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago,_Chile "Santiago, Chile"), some of which were connected to a government-operated [mainframe computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer "Mainframe computer") that would receive information on production operations, feed that information into economic modelling software, and report on variables (such as raw material supplies) that were outside normal parameters and might require attention. The project, implemented by a multidisciplinary group of both Chileans and foreigners, reached an advanced prototype stage, but was interrupted by [the 1973 coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat "1973 Chilean coup d'état").<sup id="cite_ref-RE_13-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-RE-13">[13]</a></sup>

### Viable System Model\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Viable System Model")\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Vsm.gif/240px-Vsm.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vsm.gif)

Principal functions of the [Viable System Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model "Viable system model"), 1975.

The Viable System Model (VSM) is a [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(abstract) "Model (abstract)") of the organisational structure of any viable or [autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous "Autonomous") [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System"). A viable system is any system organised in such a way as to meet the demands of surviving in the changing environment. One of the prime features of systems that survive is that they are adaptable. The VSM expresses a model for a viable system, which is an abstracted cybernetic description that is applicable to any organisation that is a viable system and capable of autonomy.

### Syntegration and Team Syntegrity\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Syntegration and Team Syntegrity")\]

Syntegrity is a formal model presented by Beer in the 1990s and now is a registered trademark. It is a form of non-hierarchical problem solving that can be used in a small team of 10 to 42 people. It is a business consultation product that is licensed out to consulting firms. The term comes from the words "[synergistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergistic "Synergistic")" and "[tensegrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity "Tensegrity")".<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

### POSIWID\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: POSIWID")\]

Stafford Beer coined and frequently used the term POSIWID (the purpose of a system is what it does) to refer to the commonly observed phenomenon that the de facto purpose of a system is often at odds with its official purpose. In an address to the [University of Valladolid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Valladolid "University of Valladolid"), Spain in October 2001, he said "According to the [cybernetician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetician "Cybernetician") the purpose of a system is what it does. This is a basic dictum. It stands for bald fact, which makes a better starting point in seeking understanding than the familiar attributions of good intention, prejudices about expectations, moral judgment or sheer ignorance of circumstances."<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> This principle has been used to describe Social Machines as intelligent, for example in the case of "games with a purpose",<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> and it provides a link between AI and cybernetics.

## Awards\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stafford_Beer&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Awards")\]

Beer received awards from the [Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Engineering_Sciences "Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences") in 1958, from the United Kingdom Systems Society, the [Cybernetics Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics_Society "Cybernetics Society"), the [American Society for Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_Cybernetics "American Society for Cybernetics"), and the [Operations Research Society of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_Research_Society_of_America "Operations Research Society of America").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.
