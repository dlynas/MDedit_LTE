If Trump were president right now liberals would be, at least performatively, far more concerned for the wellbeing and safety of protestors on college campuses because it would be extremely politically convenient for them.



I’m not so sure. Total unequivocal support for Israel is by and large bipartisan

When Trump moved the embassy to Jerusalem Harris was extremely critical of the decision. Publicly so. That’s why I emphasized performatively in my post. Materially the support is bipartisan, of course. But on the issue of campus protests liberals would be loud.

You guys didn’t care about Gaza when trump was in office & his peace plan was basically handing most of it to Bibi.

There’s a marked difference between “I didn’t care about something” and “everyone else didn’t care about that thing” and clearly you don’t understand how that distinction works

Nah they wouldn’t. They were shitting on us during the BLM protests of 2020, and they do the same now. They’ve always been this way. Stop giving them credit when they deserve none.

I famously love giving liberals credit.

BREAKING: pro-Hamas protests on college Campuses are funded by Soros & other Liberal Billionaires. Learn more below & chip in $7 or more to help us FIGHT back >>>

the very same thing could be said of the entire conflict in Palestine since Oct 7th. they support what's happening because it's happening when 'the good guys' are in charge. Trump winning, we will see a landslide of public sentiment from neoliberal pundits opining on the danger

they also wouldn’t be so quick to go “errrrmmm, the president has no control over that police department!!”

We saw that with the border detention centers.

If Trump were president Amal Clooney and hubby would be on their yacht baking and sending off cookies to Gaza on lifeboats 5 months ago

You guessed it! It's always all performative. Nothing real to any of these politicians and media types.

No I would still hate their living guts.

Lmao yup. You know they all would be hashtagging “[#Resist](https://x.com/hashtag/Resist?src=hashtag_click)” every single day like their lives depended on it, as long as they could make it seem like what the students were doing was anti-Trump.
