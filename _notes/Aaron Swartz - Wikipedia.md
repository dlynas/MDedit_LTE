**Aaron Hillel Swartz** (November 8, 1986 – January 11, 2013) was an American [computer programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programmer "Computer programmer"), entrepreneur, writer, political organizer, and Internet [hacktivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacktivism "Hacktivism"). As a programmer, Swartz helped develop the [web feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed "Web feed") format [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS "RSS");<sup id="cite_ref-:136100_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-:136100-3">[3]</a></sup> the technical architecture for [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons "Creative Commons"), an organization dedicated to creating copyright licenses;<sup id="cite_ref-:136100_3-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-:136100-3">[3]</a></sup> the website framework [web.py](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web.py "Web.py"); and the [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language "Lightweight markup language") format [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown"). Swartz was involved in the development of the [social news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_news "Social news") aggregation website [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit "Reddit") until he departed from the company in 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-8">[note 1]</a></sup> He is often credited as a [martyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr "Martyr") and a [prodigy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy "Child prodigy"),<sup id="cite_ref-martyr_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-martyr-9">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-prodigy_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-prodigy-10">[9]</a></sup> and his work focused on civic awareness and activism.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-11">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-12">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-13">[12]</a></sup>

After Reddit was sold to [Condé Nast Publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond%C3%A9_Nast_Publications "Condé Nast Publications") in 2006, Swartz became more involved in activism, helping launch the [Progressive Change Campaign Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Change_Campaign_Committee "Progressive Change Campaign Committee") in 2009. In 2010, he became a [research fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_fellow "Research fellow") at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University")'s Safra Research Lab on Institutional Corruption, directed by [Lawrence Lessig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig "Lawrence Lessig").<sup id="cite_ref-Seidman_14-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Seidman-14">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-safra_15-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-safra-15">[14]</a></sup> He founded the online group [Demand Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_Progress "Demand Progress"), known for its campaign against the [Stop Online Piracy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act "Stop Online Piracy Act").

On January 6, 2011, Swartz was arrested by [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_Police_Department "Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department") on state breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet and setting it to download [academic journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal "Academic journal") articles systematically from [JSTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSTOR "JSTOR") using a guest user account issued to him by MIT.<sup id="cite_ref-gerstein_16-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-gerstein-16">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-IncidentReport_17-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-IncidentReport-17">[16]</a></sup> Federal prosecutors, led by [Carmen Ortiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Ortiz "Carmen Ortiz"), later charged him with two counts of [wire fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_and_wire_fraud#Wire "Mail and wire fraud") and eleven violations of the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act "Computer Fraud and Abuse Act"),<sup id="cite_ref-Indictment_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Indictment-18">[17]</a></sup> carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, [asset forfeiture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_forfeiture "Asset forfeiture"), [restitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restitution "Restitution"), and [supervised release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_probation_and_supervised_release "United States federal probation and supervised release").<sup id="cite_ref-SwartzAaronPR_19-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-SwartzAaronPR-19">[18]</a></sup> Swartz declined a [plea bargain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain "Plea bargain") under which he would have served six months in federal prison.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-20">[19]</a></sup> Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead in his [Brooklyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn "Brooklyn") apartment.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-21">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-22">[21]</a></sup> In 2013, Swartz was inducted posthumously into the [Internet Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Hall_of_Fame "Internet Hall of Fame").<sup id="cite_ref-:0_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-:0-23">[22]</a></sup>

Swartz describes the nature of the shift from centralized one-to-many systems to the decentralized many-to-many topology of network communication. San Francisco, April 2007 (9:29)

Aaron Swartz was born in [Highland Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Park,_Illinois "Highland Park, Illinois"), 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago"),<sup id="cite_ref-patch.com_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-patch.com-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-24">[23]</a></sup> into a Jewish family.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-25">[24]</a></sup> He was the eldest child of Susan and Robert Swartz and brother to Noah and Ben Swartz.<sup id="cite_ref-yearwood_1-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-yearwood-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Folkhero_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Folkhero-26">[25]</a></sup> He was an [atheist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism "Atheism").<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-27">[26]</a></sup> His father founded the software firm [Mark Williams Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Williams_Company "Mark Williams Company"). At an early age, Swartz immersed himself in the study of computers, programming, the Internet, and [Internet culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberculture "Cyberculture").<sup id="cite_ref-Life_Story_28-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Life_Story-28">[27]</a></sup> He attended [North Shore Country Day School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore_Country_Day_School "North Shore Country Day School"), a small private school near Chicago, until ninth grade,<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-29">[28]</a></sup> when he left high school and enrolled in courses at [Lake Forest College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Forest_College "Lake Forest College").<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-30">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-31">[30]</a></sup>

In 1999, at age twelve, he created the website The Info Network, a user-generated encyclopedia.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-32">[31]</a></sup> The site won the [ArsDigita Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArsDigita_Prize "ArsDigita Prize"), given to young people who create "useful, educational, and collaborative" noncommercial websites and led to early recognition of Swartz's nascent talent in coding.<sup id="cite_ref-yearwood_1-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-yearwood-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-33">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-34">[33]</a></sup> At age 14, he became a member of the [working group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS-DEV_Working_Group "RSS-DEV Working Group") that authored the [RSS 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS "RSS") [web syndication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication "Web syndication") [specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_specification "Formal specification").<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-35">[34]</a></sup> A year later, he became involved in the [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons "Creative Commons") organization.<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-36">[35]</a></sup> In 2004, he enrolled at [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University") but left the school after his first year.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-37">[36]</a></sup>

### Entrepreneurship

During Swartz's first year at Stanford, he applied to [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator "Y Combinator")'s first Summer Founders Program, proposing to work on a startup called Infogami, a flexible [content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system "Content management system") designed to create rich and visually interesting websites<sup id="cite_ref-starsrise_38-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-starsrise-38">[37]</a></sup> or a form of [wiki for structured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_wiki "Semantic wiki"). After working on it with co-founder Simon Carstensen over the summer of 2005, Swartz opted not to return to Stanford, choosing instead to continue to develop and seek funding for Infogami.<sup id="cite_ref-starsrise_38-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-starsrise-38">[37]</a></sup>

As part of his work on Infogami, Swartz created the web.py [web application framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework "Web application framework") because he was unhappy with other available systems in the [Python programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)"). In the early fall of 2005, he worked with his fellow co-founders of another nascent Y-Combinator firm, [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit "Reddit"), to rewrite its [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language) "Lisp (programming language)") codebase using Python and web.py. Although Infogami's platform was abandoned after Not a Bug was acquired, Infogami's software was used to support the [Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive "Internet Archive")'s [Open Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Library "Open Library") project and the web.py web framework was used as the basis for many other projects by Swartz and many others.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-39">[38]</a></sup>

When Infogami failed to find further funding, Y-Combinator organizers suggested Infogami merge with Reddit,<sup id="cite_ref-infogami2007_40-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-infogami2007-40">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-41">[40]</a></sup> which it did in November 2005, creating a new firm, Not a Bug, devoted to promoting both products.<sup id="cite_ref-infogami2007_40-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-infogami2007-40">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Wired-arrest_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Wired-arrest-6">[6]</a></sup> As a result, Swartz was given the title of co-founder of Reddit. Although both projects initially struggled, Reddit made large gains in popularity in 2005–2006.

In October 2006, based largely on Reddit's success, Not a Bug was acquired by [Condé Nast Publications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond%C3%A9_Nast_Publications "Condé Nast Publications"), owner of _[Wired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine) "Wired (magazine)")_ magazine.<sup id="cite_ref-Life_Story_28-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Life_Story-28">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-42">[41]</a></sup> Swartz moved with his company to San Francisco to continue to work on Reddit for _Wired_.<sup id="cite_ref-Life_Story_28-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Life_Story-28">[27]</a></sup> He found corporate office life uncongenial and ultimately was asked to resign from the company.<sup id="cite_ref-A_Chat_with_Aaron_Swartz_43-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-A_Chat_with_Aaron_Swartz-43">[42]</a></sup> In September 2007, he joined Infogami co-founder Simon Carstensen to launch a new firm, Jottit, in another attempt to create a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown")\-driven [content management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system "Content management system") in Python.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-44">[43]</a></sup>

## Activism

In 2008, Swartz founded Watchdog.net, "the good government site with teeth", to aggregate and visualize data about politicians.<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-45">[44]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-46">[45]</a></sup> That year, he wrote a widely circulated _[Guerilla Open Access Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#Open_Access)_.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-47">[46]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Guard_48-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Guard-48">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-OAGM_49-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-OAGM-49">[48]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-50">[49]</a></sup> On December 27, 2010, he filed a [Freedom of Information Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States) "Freedom of Information Act (United States)") (FOIA) request to learn about the treatment of [Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning "Chelsea Manning"), alleged source for [WikiLeaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks "WikiLeaks").<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-51">[50]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-52">[51]</a></sup> His activism has been praised by digital rights groups such as the [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation "Electronic Frontier Foundation").<sup id="cite_ref-:136100_3-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-:136100-3">[3]</a></sup>

### PACER

In 2008, Swartz downloaded about 2.7 million [federal court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_courts "United States federal courts") documents stored in the [PACER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACER_(law) "PACER (law)") (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) database managed by the [Administrative Office of the United States Courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Office_of_the_United_States_Courts "Administrative Office of the United States Courts").<sup id="cite_ref-arstechnica.com_53-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-arstechnica.com-53">[52]</a></sup>

The _Huffington Post_ characterized his actions this way: "Swartz downloaded public court documents from the PACER system in an effort to make them available outside of the expensive service. The move drew the attention of the FBI, which ultimately decided not to press charges as the documents were, in fact, public."<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-54">[53]</a></sup>

PACER was charging eight cents per page for information that [Carl Malamud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Malamud "Carl Malamud"), who founded the nonprofit group [Public.Resource.Org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public.Resource.Org "Public.Resource.Org"), contended should be free, because federal documents are not covered by copyright.<sup id="cite_ref-Schwartz2009_55-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Schwartz2009-55">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Singel2009_56-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Singel2009-56">[55]</a></sup> The fees were "plowed back to the courts to finance technology, but the system \[ran\] a budget surplus of some $150 million, according to court reports," reported _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_.<sup id="cite_ref-Schwartz2009_55-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Schwartz2009-55">[54]</a></sup> PACER used technology that was "designed in the bygone days of screechy telephone modems ... putting the nation's legal system behind a wall of cash and kludge."<sup id="cite_ref-Schwartz2009_55-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Schwartz2009-55">[54]</a></sup> Malamud appealed to fellow activists, urging them to visit one of 17 libraries conducting a free trial of the PACER system, download court documents, and send them to him for public distribution.<sup id="cite_ref-Schwartz2009_55-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Schwartz2009-55">[54]</a></sup>

After reading Malamud's call for action,<sup id="cite_ref-Schwartz2009_55-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Schwartz2009-55">[54]</a></sup> Swartz used a [Perl computer script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language#General-purpose_dynamic_languages "Scripting language") running on [Amazon cloud servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud") to download the documents, using credentials belonging to a Sacramento library.<sup id="cite_ref-arstechnica.com_53-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-arstechnica.com-53">[52]</a></sup> From September 4 to 20, 2008, it accessed documents and uploaded them to a [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing "Cloud computing") service. He released the documents to Malamud's organization.<sup id="cite_ref-Singel2009_56-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Singel2009-56">[55]</a></sup>

On September 29, 2008, the [GPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Government_Printing_Office "United States Government Printing Office") suspended the free trial, "pending an evaluation" of the program.

At a 2013 memorial for Swartz, Malamud recalled their work with PACER. They brought millions of U.S. District Court records out from behind PACER's "pay wall", he said, and found them full of privacy violations, including medical records and the names of minor children and confidential informants.

> We sent our results to the Chief Judges of 31 District Courts ... They redacted those documents and they yelled at the lawyers that filed them ... The Judicial Conference changed their privacy rules. ... \[To\] the bureaucrats who ran the Administrative Office of the United States Courts ... we were thieves that took $1.6 million of their property. So they called the FBI ... \[The FBI\] found nothing wrong ...<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-59">[58]</a></sup>

Based on the facts that Swartz downloaded 2.7 million documents while PACER, at the time, contained 500 million, Lee concluded that Swartz downloaded less than one percent of the database.<sup id="cite_ref-arstechnica.com_53-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-arstechnica.com-53">[52]</a></sup>

Swartz in 2012 protesting against the [Stop Online Piracy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act "Stop Online Piracy Act") (SOPA)

Swartz was involved in the campaign to prevent passage of the [Stop Online Piracy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act "Stop Online Piracy Act") (SOPA), which sought to combat Internet copyright violations but was criticized on the basis that it would make it easier for the U.S. government to shut down web sites accused of violating copyright and would place intolerable burdens on Internet providers.<sup id="cite_ref-stuff1_69-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-stuff1-69">[68]</a></sup> After the bill's defeat, Swartz was the keynote speaker at the F2C:Freedom to Connect 2012 event in Washington, D.C., on May 21, 2012. In his speech, "How We Stopped SOPA", he said:

> This bill ... shut down whole websites. Essentially, it stopped Americans from communicating entirely with certain groups....  
> I called all my friends, and we stayed up all night setting up a website for this new group, Demand Progress, with an online petition opposing this noxious bill.... We \[got\] ... 300,000 signers.... We met with the staff of members of Congress and pleaded with them.... And then it passed unanimously....  
> And then, suddenly, the process stopped. Senator [Ron Wyden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Wyden "Ron Wyden") ... put a hold on the bill.<sup id="cite_ref-F2c2_70-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-F2c2-70">[69]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-agdemnow_71-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-agdemnow-71">[70]</a></sup>

Swartz at 2009 Boston Wikipedia Meetup

Swartz participated in Wikipedia since August 2003 under the username **[AaronSw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AaronSw "User:AaronSw")**.<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-74">[73]</a></sup> In 2006, he ran unsuccessfully for the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation "Wikimedia Foundation")'s Board of Trustees.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-75">[74]</a></sup>

In 2006, Swartz wrote an analysis of how Wikipedia articles are written, and concluded that the bulk of its content came from tens of thousands of occasional contributors, or "outsiders," each of whom made few other contributions to the site, while a core group of 500 to 1,000 regular editors tended to correct spelling and other formatting errors.<sup id="cite_ref-whowriteswikipedia_76-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-whowriteswikipedia-76">[75]</a></sup> He said: "The formatters aid the contributors, not the other way around."<sup id="cite_ref-whowriteswikipedia_76-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-whowriteswikipedia-76">[75]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-77">[76]</a></sup> His conclusions, based on the analysis of edit histories of several randomly selected articles, contradicted the opinion of Wikipedia co-founder [Jimmy Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales "Jimmy Wales"), who believed the core group of regular editors provided most of the content while thousands of others contributed to formatting issues. Swartz came to his conclusions by counting the number of characters editors added to particular articles, while Wales counted the total number of edits.<sup id="cite_ref-whowriteswikipedia_76-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-whowriteswikipedia-76">[75]</a></sup>

### WikiLeaks

In January 2013, shortly after he died, [WikiLeaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks "WikiLeaks") said that Aaron Swartz had helped WikiLeaks and talked to [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange "Julian Assange") in 2010 and 2011. WikiLeaks also said they had "strong reasons to believe, but cannot prove" he may have been a source, possibly breaking WikiLeaks' rules about source anonymity. WikiLeaks may have made the statements to imply that Swartz was targeted by the US Attorney's Office and Secret Service in order to get at WikiLeaks.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-78">[77]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-79">[78]</a></sup>

## _United States v. Aaron Swartz_ case

According to state and federal authorities, Swartz used [JSTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSTOR "JSTOR"), a [digital repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_repository "Digital repository"),<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-80">[79]</a></sup> to download a large number<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-81">[note 2]</a></sup> of [academic journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal "Academic journal") articles through MIT's computer network over the course of a few weeks in late 2010 and early 2011. Visitors to MIT's "open campus" were authorized to access JSTOR through its network;<sup id="cite_ref-macfarquhar_82-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-macfarquhar-82">[80]</a></sup> Swartz, as a research fellow at Harvard University, also had a JSTOR account.<sup id="cite_ref-Indictment_18-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Indictment-18">[17]</a></sup>

### Article download

On September 25, 2010, the [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address") 18.55.6.215, part of the MIT network, began sending hundreds of PDF download requests per minute to the JSTOR website, enough to slow the site's performance.<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-83">[81]</a></sup> This prompted a block of the IP address. In the morning, another IP address, also from within the MIT network, began sending more PDF download requests, resulting in a temporary block on the [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing) "Firewall (computing)") level of all MIT computers in the entire [18.0.0.0/8 range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assigned_/8_IPv4_address_blocks "List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks"). A JSTOR employee emailed MIT on September 29, 2010:

> Note that this was an extreme case. We typically suspend just one individual IP at a time and do that relatively infrequently (perhaps 6 on a busy day, from 7000+ institutional subscribers). In this case, we saw a performance hit on the live site, which I have only seen about 3 or 4 times in my 5 years here. The pattern used was to create a new session for each PDF download or every few, which was terribly efficient, but not terribly subtle. In the end, we saw over 200K sessions in one hour's time during the peak.<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-84">[82]</a></sup>

According to authorities, Swartz downloaded the documents through a laptop connected to a networking switch in a controlled-access [wiring closet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiring_closet "Wiring closet") at MIT.<sup id="cite_ref-IncidentReport_17-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-IncidentReport-17">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Indictment_18-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Indictment-18">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-85">[83]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-86">[84]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-cohen_87-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-cohen-87">[85]</a></sup> The closet's door was kept unlocked, according to press reports.<sup id="cite_ref-macfarquhar_82-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-macfarquhar-82">[80]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-88">[86]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-JM_89-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-JM-89">[87]</a></sup> When it was discovered, a video camera was placed in the room to record Swartz; his computer was left untouched. The recording was stopped once Swartz was identified, but rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him, JSTOR settled with him in June 2011; under the terms of the settlement, he surrendered the downloaded data.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-90">[88]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-91">[89]</a></sup>

On July 30, 2013, JSTOR released 300 partially redacted documents used as incriminating evidence against Swartz, originally sent to the United States Attorney's Office in response to subpoenas in the case _United States v.

Swartz's legacy has been reported as strengthening the [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access "Open access") to scholarship movement.

## Legacy

### Open Access

A long-time supporter of [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access "Open access"), Swartz wrote in his _Guerilla Open Access Manifesto_:<sup id="cite_ref-OAGM_49-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-OAGM-49">[48]</a></sup>

> The world's entire scientific ... heritage ... is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations....
> 
> The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it.

Supporters of Swartz responded to news of his death with an effort called #PDFTribute to promote Open Access.<sup id="cite_ref-191"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-191">[189]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-musil_192-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-musil-192">[190]</a></sup> On January 12, [Eva Vivalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Vivalt "Eva Vivalt"), a development economist at the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank"), began posting her academic articles online using the [hashtag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag "Hashtag") _#pdftribute_ as a tribute to Swartz.<sup id="cite_ref-musil_192-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-musil-192">[190]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-193"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-193">[191]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-194"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-194">[192]</a></sup> Scholars posted links to their works.<sup id="cite_ref-195"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-195">[193]</a></sup> Swartz' story has exposed the topic of open access to scientific publications to wider audiences.<sup id="cite_ref-196"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-196">[194]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-197"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-197">[195]</a></sup> In Swartz' wake, many institutions and personalities have campaigned for open access to scientific knowledge.<sup id="cite_ref-198"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-198">[196]</a></sup> Swartz's death prompted calls for more open access to scholarly data (e.g., [open science data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science_data "Open science data")).<sup id="cite_ref-199"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-199">[197]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-200"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-200">[198]</a></sup> The Think Computer Foundation and the Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP) at [Princeton University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University "Princeton University") announced scholarships awarded in memory of Swartz.<sup id="cite_ref-201"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-201">[199]</a></sup> In 2013, Swartz was posthumously awarded the [American Library Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Library_Association "American Library Association")'s [James Madison Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison_Award "James Madison Award") for being an "outspoken advocate for public participation in government and unrestricted access to peer-reviewed scholarly articles."<sup id="cite_ref-202"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-202">[200]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-203"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-203">[201]</a></sup> In March, the editor and editorial board of the _[Journal of Library Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Library_Administration "Journal of Library Administration")_ resigned _en masse_, citing a dispute with the journal's publisher, [Routledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routledge "Routledge").<sup id="cite_ref-204"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-204">[202]</a></sup> One board member wrote of a "crisis of conscience about publishing in a journal that was not open access" after the death of Swartz.<sup id="cite_ref-205"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-205">[203]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-206"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-206">[204]</a></sup> In 2002, Swartz had stated that when he died, he wanted all the contents of his hard drives made publicly available.<sup id="cite_ref-207"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-207">[205]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-208"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-208">[206]</a></sup>

### Congress

Several members of the [U.S. House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._House_of_Representatives "U.S. House of Representatives") – Republican [Darrell Issa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrell_Issa "Darrell Issa") and Democrats [Zoe Lofgren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Lofgren "Zoe Lofgren") and subsequent Colorado Governor [Jared Polis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Polis "Jared Polis") – all on the [House Judiciary Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Judiciary_Committee "House Judiciary Committee"), raised questions regarding the government's handling of the case.

Calling the charges against him "ridiculous and trumped up," Polis said Swartz was a "martyr", whose death illustrated the need for Congress to limit the discretion of federal prosecutors.<sup id="cite_ref-Hill_209-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Hill-209">[207]</a></sup> Speaking at a memorial for Swartz on [Capitol Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill "Capitol Hill"), Issa said

> Ultimately, knowledge belongs to all the people of the world.... Aaron understood that.... Our copyright laws were created for the purpose of promoting useful works, not hiding them.

Massachusetts Democratic Senator [Elizabeth Warren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren "Elizabeth Warren") issued a statement saying "\[Aaron's\] advocacy for Internet freedom, social justice, and Wall Street reform demonstrated ... the power of his ideas ..."<sup id="cite_ref-HuffPo15_210-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-HuffPo15-210">[208]</a></sup>

In a letter to Attorney General [Eric Holder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder "Eric Holder"),<sup id="cite_ref-211"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-211">[209]</a></sup> Texas Republican Senator [John Cornyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn "John Cornyn") asked, "On what basis did the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts conclude that her office's conduct was 'appropriate'?" and "Was the prosecution of Mr. Swartz in any way retaliation for his exercise of his rights as a citizen under the Freedom of Information Act?"<sup id="cite_ref-212"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-212">[210]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-213"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-213">[211]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-214"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-214">[212]</a></sup>

#### Congressional investigations

Issa, who chaired the [House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Oversight_and_Government_Reform "United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform"), announced that he would investigate the Justice Department's actions in prosecuting Swartz.<sup id="cite_ref-Hill_209-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Hill-209">[207]</a></sup> In a statement to _The Huffington Post_, he praised Swartz's work toward "open government and free access to the people."

On January 28, 2013, Issa and ranking committee member [Elijah Cummings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Cummings "Elijah Cummings") published a letter to U.S. Attorney General Holder, questioning why federal prosecutors had filed the superseding indictment.<sup id="cite_ref-Zetter_107-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Zetter-107">[105]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-215"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-215">[213]</a></sup> On February 20, [WBUR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBUR "WBUR") reported that Ortiz was expected to testify at an upcoming Oversight Committee hearing about her office's handling of the Swartz case.<sup id="cite_ref-216"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-216">[214]</a></sup> On February 22, Associate Deputy Attorney General [Steven Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Reich "Steven Reich") conducted a briefing for congressional staffers involved in the investigation.<sup id="cite_ref-Reich_217-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Reich-217">[215]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-dirt_218-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-dirt-218">[216]</a></sup> They were told that Swartz's _Guerilla Open Access Manifesto_ played a role in prosecutorial decision-making.<sup id="cite_ref-Guard_48-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Guard-48">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Reich_217-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Reich-217">[215]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-dirt_218-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-dirt-218">[216]</a></sup> Congressional staffers left this briefing believing that prosecutors thought Swartz had to be convicted of a felony carrying at least a short prison sentence in order to justify having filed the case against him in the first place.<sup id="cite_ref-Reich_217-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Reich-217">[215]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-dirt_218-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-dirt-218">[216]</a></sup>

Excoriating the Department of Justice as the "Department of Vengeance", Stinebrickner-Kauffman told the _Guardian_ that the DOJ had erred in relying on Swartz's _Guerilla Open Access Manifesto_ as an accurate indication of his beliefs by 2010. "He was no longer a single issue activist," she said. "He was into lots of things, from healthcare, to climate change to money in politics."<sup id="cite_ref-Guard_48-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Guard-48">[47]</a></sup>

On March 6, Holder testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the case was "a good use of prosecutorial discretion."<sup id="cite_ref-219"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-219">[217]</a></sup> Stinebrickner-Kauffman issued a statement in reply, repeating and amplifying her claims of prosecutorial misconduct. Public documents, she wrote, reveal that prosecutor Stephen Heymann "instructed the Secret Service to seize and hold evidence without a warrant... lied to the judge about that fact in written briefs... \[and\] withheld exculpatory evidence... for over a year," violating his legal and ethical obligations to turn such evidence over to the defense.<sup id="cite_ref-220"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-220">[218]</a></sup> On March 22, Senator [Al Franken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Franken "Al Franken") wrote Holder a letter expressing concerns, writing that "charging a young man like Mr. Swartz with federal offenses punishable by over 35 years of federal imprisonment seems remarkably aggressive – particularly when it appears that one of the principal aggrieved parties ... did not support a criminal prosecution."<sup id="cite_ref-221"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-221">[219]</a></sup>

#### Amendment to Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg/38px-Wikisource-logo.svg.png)

[Wikisource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikisource "Wikisource") has original text related to this article:

In 2013, Rep. [Zoe Lofgren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Lofgren "Zoe Lofgren") (D-Calif.) introduced a bill, _[Aaron's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron%27s_Law "Aaron's Law")_ ([H.R. 2454](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2454), [S. 1196](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1196)<sup id="cite_ref-222"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-222">[220]</a></sup>) to exclude [terms of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service "Terms of service") violations from the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and from the wire fraud statute.<sup id="cite_ref-223"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-223">[221]</a></sup>

Lawrence Lessig wrote of the bill, "this is a critically important change.... The CFAA was the hook for the government's bullying.... This law would remove that hook. In a single line: no longer would it be a felony to breach a contract."<sup id="cite_ref-224"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-224">[222]</a></sup> Professor Orin Kerr, a specialist in the nexus between computer law and criminal law, wrote that he had been arguing for precisely this sort of reform of the Act for years.<sup id="cite_ref-225"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-225">[223]</a></sup> The [ACLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACLU "ACLU"), too, has called for reform of the CFAA to "remove the dangerously broad criminalization of online activity."<sup id="cite_ref-226"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-226">[224]</a></sup> The [EFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation "Electronic Frontier Foundation") has mounted a campaign for these reforms.<sup id="cite_ref-227"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-227">[225]</a></sup> Lessig's inaugural Chair lecture as Furman Professor of Law and Leadership was entitled _Aaron's Laws: Law and Justice in a Digital Age_; he dedicated the lecture to Swartz.<sup id="cite_ref-228"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-228">[226]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-229"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-229">[227]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-230"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-230">[228]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-231"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-231">[229]</a></sup>

The Aaron's Law bill stalled in committee. [Brian Knappenberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Knappenberger "Brian Knappenberger") alleges this was due to [Oracle Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation "Oracle Corporation")'s financial interest in maintaining the status quo.<sup id="cite_ref-232"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-232">[230]</a></sup>

#### Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act

The [Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Access_to_Science_and_Technology_Research_Act "Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act") (FASTR) is a bill that would mandate earlier public release of taxpayer-funded research. FASTR has been described as "The Other Aaron's Law."<sup id="cite_ref-233"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-233">[231]</a></sup>

Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Senator John Cornyn (R-Tex.) introduced the Senate version in 2013, 2015, and 2017 while the bill was introduced to the House by Reps. [Zoe Lofgren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Lofgren "Zoe Lofgren") (D-Calif.), [Mike Doyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_F._Doyle "Michael F. Doyle") (D-Pa.) and [Kevin Yoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Yoder "Kevin Yoder") (R-Kans.). Senator Wyden wrote of the bill, "the FASTR act provides that access to taxpayer funded research should never be hidden behind a paywall."<sup id="cite_ref-234"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-234">[232]</a></sup>

While the legislation had not passed as of August 2017, it helped to prompt some motion toward more open access on the part of the US administration. Shortly after the bill's original introduction, the [Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Science_and_Technology_Policy "Office of Science and Technology Policy") directed "each Federal agency with over $100 million in annual conduct of research and development expenditures to develop a plan to support increased public access to the results of research funded by the Federal Government."<sup id="cite_ref-235"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-235">[233]</a></sup>

**Aaron Swartz Day**

Since 2013 there has been a yearly event called Aaron Swartz day where people organize hackathons and there are live streamed talks related to issues Aaron was passionate about like open access. Past speakers include [Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning "Chelsea Manning"), [Barrett Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_Brown "Barrett Brown"), Trevor Timm from [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_Press_Foundation "Freedom of the Press Foundation"), [Cory Doctorow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow "Cory Doctorow"), [Cindy Cohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Cohn "Cindy Cohn"), [Jason Leopold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Leopold "Jason Leopold"), and [Brewster Kahle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle "Brewster Kahle").

## Media

Swartz has been featured in various works of art and has posthumously received dedications from numerous artists. In 2013, [Kenneth Goldsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Goldsmith "Kenneth Goldsmith") dedicated his "[Printing out the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_out_the_Internet "Printing out the Internet")" exhibition to Swartz.<sup id="cite_ref-236"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-236">[234]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-237"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-237">[235]</a></sup> There are also dedicated biographical films for Aaron:

On January 11, 2014, marking the first anniversary of his death, a preview was released of _The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz_,<sup id="cite_ref-238"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-238">[236]</a></sup> a documentary about Swartz, the [NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA "NSA") and [SOPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOPA "SOPA").<sup id="cite_ref-239"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-239">[237]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-240"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-240">[238]</a></sup> The film was officially released at the January 2014 [Sundance Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Film_Festival "Sundance Film Festival").<sup id="cite_ref-241"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-241">[239]</a></sup> _[Democracy Now!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Now! "Democracy Now!")_ covered the release of the documentary, as well as Swartz's life and legal case, in a sprawling interview with director [Brian Knappenberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Knappenberger "Brian Knappenberger"), Swartz's father, brother, and his attorney.<sup id="cite_ref-242"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-242">[240]</a></sup> The documentary is released under a [Creative Commons License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_License "Creative Commons License");<sup id="cite_ref-243"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-243">[241]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-244"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-244">[242]</a></sup> it debuted in theaters and on-demand in June 2014.<sup id="cite_ref-245"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-245">[243]</a></sup>

[Mashable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashable "Mashable") called the documentary "a powerful homage to Aaron Swartz". Its debut at _Sundance_ received a standing ovation. _Mashable_ printed, "With the help of experts, _The Internet's Own Boy_ makes a clear argument: Swartz unjustly became a victim of the rights and freedoms for which he stood."<sup id="cite_ref-246"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-246">[244]</a></sup> _[The Hollywood Reporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter "The Hollywood Reporter")_ described it as a "heartbreaking" story of a "tech wunderkind persecuted by the U.S. government", and a must-see "for anyone who knows enough to care about the way laws govern information transfer in the digital age".<sup id="cite_ref-247"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-247">[245]</a></sup>

### _Killswitch_

In October 2014, _Killswitch_, a documentary film featuring Swartz, as well as Lawrence Lessig, [Tim Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Wu "Tim Wu"), and [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden "Edward Snowden"), received its world premiere at the [Woodstock Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_Film_Festival "Woodstock Film Festival"), where it won the award for Best Editing. The film focuses on Swartz's role in advocating for internet freedoms.<sup id="cite_ref-von_Busack_248-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-von_Busack-248">[246]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Swegles_249-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Swegles-249">[247]</a></sup>

In February 2015, _Killswitch_ was invited to screen at the Capitol Visitor's Center in Washington, D.C., by Congressman [Alan Grayson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Grayson "Alan Grayson"). The event was held on the eve of the Federal Communications Commission's historic decision on [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality "Net neutrality"). Congressman Grayson, Lawrence Lessig, and [Free Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Press_(organization) "Free Press (organization)") CEO Craig Aaron spoke about Swartz and his fight on behalf of a free and open Internet at the event.<sup id="cite_ref-grayson.house.gov_250-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-grayson.house.gov-250">[248]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-251"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-251">[249]</a></sup>

Congressman Grayson states that _Killswitch_ is "one of the most honest accounts of the battle to control the Internet – and access to information itself."<sup id="cite_ref-grayson.house.gov_250-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-grayson.house.gov-250">[248]</a></sup> [Richard von Busack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_von_Busack "Richard von Busack") of the [Metro Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Silicon_Valley "Metro Silicon Valley") writes of _Killswitch_, "Some of the most lapidary use of found footage this side of The Atomic Café".<sup id="cite_ref-von_Busack_248-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-von_Busack-248">[246]</a></sup> Fred Swegles of the _[Orange County Register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County_Register "Orange County Register")_ remarks, "Anyone who values unfettered access to online information is apt to be captivated by _Killswitch_, a gripping and fast-paced documentary."<sup id="cite_ref-Swegles_249-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-Swegles-249">[247]</a></sup> Kathy Gill of [GeekWire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeekWire "GeekWire") asserts that "_Killswitch_ is much more than a dry recitation of technical history. Director Ali Akbarzadeh, producer Jeff Horn, and writer Chris Dollar created a human-centered story. A large part of that connection comes from Lessig and his relationship with Swartz."<sup id="cite_ref-252"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-252">[250]</a></sup>

### Other films

Another biographical film about Swartz, _Think Aaron_, is being developed by [HBO Films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO_Films "HBO Films") as of 2020.<sup id="cite_ref-253"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-253">[251]</a></sup>

In May 2013, the first instance of the software was launched by _[The New Yorker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")_ under the name _Strongbox_.<sup id="cite_ref-260"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-260">[258]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-261"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-261">[259]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-262"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-262">[260]</a></sup> The [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_Press_Foundation "Freedom of the Press Foundation") has since taken over development of the software, which has been renamed _[SecureDrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecureDrop "SecureDrop")_.<sup id="cite_ref-263"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-263">[261]</a></sup>
-   [Tor2web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor2web "Tor2web"): In 2008,<sup id="cite_ref-264"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-264">[262]</a></sup> Swartz worked with [Virgil Griffith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_Griffith "Virgil Griffith") to design and implement [Tor2web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor2web "Tor2web"), an HTTP proxy for [Tor-hidden services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor-hidden_service "Tor-hidden service"). The proxy was designed to provide easy access to Tor from a basic [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser").<sup id="cite_ref-265"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-265">[263]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-266"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#cite_note-266">[264]</a></sup> The software is now maintained by Giovanni Pellerano within the [GlobaLeaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlobaLeaks "GlobaLeaks") project.
