## Good leftist YouTubers?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism_101/comments/s5k8aa/good_leftist_youtubers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism_101/comments/s5k8aa/good_leftist_youtubers/)

> Anyone know good leftist YouTubers to watch? I’ve been watching a lot of big Joel, hbomberguy, and innuendo studios and I’d like to consume more “radical” content.

	We’re in hell, unlearning economics and bizarrely Some More News. I mean they’re not exactly Michael Parenti but they’re not bad.

	* 🟨 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 118 _(2022-01-16 15:48:52)_

		Some More News is really good. I wouldn't classify it as radical or socialist, but it is a good place to start for those that are squeamish about socialism or have no background in radical leftist thought.

		* 🟧 **[JoeyLa47](https://www.reddit.com/user/JoeyLa47)** ⬆️ 70 _(2022-01-16 16:15:23)_

			I mean he’s at least willing to be left stream and try to appeal to a liberal audience whilst still preaching socialism or socialist ideas. Second Thought is also good.

			* 🟦 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 49 _(2022-01-16 16:29:05)_

				Oh definitely! I love that it's very "safe" for the average liberal, meaning that they won't be immediately turned off by the content; yet it doesn't espouse liberalism, nor does it affirm liberal talking points, leading the centrist-minded viewer towards the left without the viewer fully realizing it.

					I think you've identified what gave me the nudge over the leftist edge and into the rabbit hole of socialism. I started watching some more news a few months ago and have gone from left leaning to subscribing to the idea of full on socialism. 
					
					I think JP from Second Thought is right when he says most people have socialist ideals and just don't know it.

				* 🟪 **[ivanthecur](https://www.reddit.com/user/ivanthecur)** ⬆️ 31 _(2022-01-16 18:10:26)_

					I think it's more that Some More News frames issues in ways that show how conservatism overtly favors the rich and points out that Democrats in America don't really have or want to implement the solutions.  What that leaves you is often soc-dem or socialist solutions.

	Renegade Cut is pretty good. He does a mixture of straight forward political stuff and movie analysis from a leftist perspective. His [video](https://youtu.be/PVfmIOWY6go) on Forrest Gump is what hooked me on his channel

	* 🟨 **[Vivec-Warrior-Poet](https://www.reddit.com/user/Vivec-Warrior-Poet)** ⬆️ 12 _(2022-01-16 19:18:08)_

	I'm quite a big fan of the radical reviewer - a cute dog reviewing books and other things from a leftist lense, and they're very radical to say the least

	* 🟨 **[ArnoldShortman3](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArnoldShortman3)** ⬆️ 6 _(2022-01-16 22:20:21)_

		Don’t forget Marxist Paul

		* 🟧 **[KarlMarxOwO](https://www.reddit.com/user/KarlMarxOwO)** ⬆️ 20 _(2022-01-17 00:53:08)_

			My only downside with him is he tends to be more Maoist and he argued for trump to be president for a bit in a podcast that I listened to.

			* 🟦 **[Sudden_Chain_5582](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sudden_Chain_5582)** ⬆️ 12 _(2022-01-17 02:35:56)_

				I know this guy personally since he used to be in my own communist organisation before leaving since tk join another. I would say he definitely is ultra leftist and goes too far in places to the point of not engaging in much actual activism

				* 🟪 **[KarlMarxOwO](https://www.reddit.com/user/KarlMarxOwO)** ⬆️ 14 _(2022-01-17 02:47:02)_

					He argued specifically for accelerationism with Trump, which is blatant white chauvinism, it completely disregards the immediate danger a president like that could have in America, this is not to say to vote for Biden, but voting for Trump for that reason is a horrible decision

					* 🟥 **[echoesofalife](https://www.reddit.com/user/echoesofalife)** ⬆️ 4 _(2022-01-17 04:05:45)_

						The past year has kinda shown that a 95% Trump acting unopposed can do a lot more damage than a 100% Trump opposed by every single news media, public figure and activist apparatus 
						
						I don't know Marxist Paul but if anything he's been kinda validated

						* 🟫 **[KarlMarxOwO](https://www.reddit.com/user/KarlMarxOwO)** ⬆️ 2 _(2022-01-17 11:11:54)_

							Yes I’m not disagreeing, but he stated that it might be good to make Trump president so that American society fully disintegrates.  This is faulty because we’d likely have a fascist revolution come to power  as a result.

	* 🟨 **[nmkensok](https://www.reddit.com/user/nmkensok)** ⬆️ 111 _(2022-01-16 17:03:17)_

	I really like Second Thought. Hassan I also had ak official YouTube channel along with several other channels with his content cut in different ways, as he doesn’t place claim over the IP.

* 🟩 **[SocialUrbanist](https://www.reddit.com/user/SocialUrbanist)** ⬆️ 15 _(2022-01-17 03:46:16)_

	1. [Tom Nicholas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxt2r57cLastdmrReiQJkEg); long form videos which explore the intersection between politics and culture.

	2. [Adam Something](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamSomething/about); mostly Urban/Public Transportation Infrastructure related videos from a leftist POV with the usual debunking videos.

	3. [MarxistPaul](https://youtube.com/c/MarxistPaul); He has a playlist for [Socialism 101](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0J754r0IteXABJntjBg1YuNsn6jItWXQ) &amp; deep dive into theory.

	4. [AzureScapegoat](https://youtube.com/c/azureScapegoat); Not very active, but has a lot of great informative content where he explains how socialism is implemented in socialist countries.

	5. [Viki1999](https://youtube.com/c/Viki1999); **Great** leftist content over all.

	6. [SpookyScarySocialist](https://youtube.com/c/SpookyScarySocialist); only has 3 videos, but great at surface level explaining (I personally like his [Debunking Every Anti-Communist Argument Ever](https://youtu.be/MjwL1mSrPLA), it's only a reserved response to people who misunderstood Communism not for deep Questions &amp; Arguments).

	7. [BadEmpanada](https://youtube.com/c/BadEmpanada) &amp; [BadEmpanada 2](https://youtube.com/c/EmpanadaReport) were you can find clips of his Twitch stream; A rational socialist who cares about facts, I personally recommend watching [Israel's TRUE Nature - Palestinian Explains What Most Don't Know](https://youtu.be/VJFP1nH2MyA) &amp; [Israel / Palestine: It's SETTLER COLONIALISM](https://youtu.be/mro9y8KZObk) to educate yourself about the Palestinian Cause, since we live in the age of misinformation.

	8. [The Kavernacle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoG5ya-sMXNMkqkIz1sZ_Lw); meh, but informative (Drama wise) nonetheless.

	9. [Infranaut](https://www.youtube.com/c/Infranaut/featured); great content, but doesn't upload that much unfortunately.

	10. And lastly, those three - **my favorite -** created a new podcast ([The Deprogram](https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/6ZEV5)) hosted by: [YUGOPNIK](https://youtube.com/c/YUGOPNIK) (if you don't want socialist content he has 2 great **Documentaries on the Aesthetics of Evil**; [The Fascist Uniform](https://youtu.be/5pOdESxw1o4) &amp; [The Nazi Salute](https://youtu.be/kXwWZItd1jw)); cool videos overall, [SecondThought](https://youtube.com/c/SecondThought); professional production that is mostly guided to North American topics, [Hakim](https://youtube.com/c/ComradeLenin); Iraqi Medical Doctor who presents great arguments overall.

	F.D. Signifier, The Storyteller, Thought Slime, We're in Hell, Curio, Mexie, Luna Oi, Renegade Cut, Zoe Bee, Hakim, Bad Empanada, St Andrewism, Khadija Mbowe, Foreign Man in a Foreign land, Rational National and there's a small Channel called The Partizan that has a great series on Yugoslavia that I would recommend. 

	These channels are all over the spectrum of left politics but I think each of them make quality content that is worth listening to. Even if you don't 100% agree with everything they say.

	Enjoy comrade ✊

	Unlearning Economics is a channel that does topical videos on economics. Imo more leftist people should actively engage with (heterodox) economics.

	There was a period in time, early 20th C, where socialist (and Marxist) economists were a significant, almost dominant, force in the field. Leftists shouldn't shy away from the topic and UE is solid, scientifically and empirically informed and properly nuanced.

		* 🟧 **[thedrunkemoji](https://www.reddit.com/user/thedrunkemoji)** ⬆️ 7 _(2022-01-18 05:24:40)_

			if Jews DID control the banks though, would the Holocaust still be bad? That’s what Vaush was getting at, whether or not it was true didn’t matter. Noncompete made it very clear in his stream after he hung up that his ethical framework is based on material conditions, while vaush explained that his ethical framework is principally against genocide regardless of material conditions.

				I'm very new to breadtube so I understand my view on things is very skewed, but when did Vaush say these things? Again, I am not trying to be rude but am genuinely curious as to the instances you guys have mentioned in this thread.
				
				Also, a LOT of people are praising Hakim on this post and simultaneously trashing Vaush. But in the only debate video I've watched between them, they did pretty much nothing but agree with each other the whole time. So...where's the love for Hakim meet the hate for Vaush?

				* 🟪 **[_AMReddits](https://www.reddit.com/user/_AMReddits)** ⬆️ 1 _(2022-01-17 14:09:55)_

					The most recent thing is a debate he had with noncompete who is an AnCom but their spouse is a ML. In the debate Vaush made a comment about how Jews ran all the banks during the Weimar Republic. When noncompete rightfully said that's is Nazi propaganda, Vaush double down. Non compete then ended the stream right there. 
					
					Edit: There's a lot more then that.

					* 🟥 **[Hero17](https://www.reddit.com/user/Hero17)** ⬆️ 3 _(2022-01-19 14:03:58)_

						Vaush said there was a disproportionate number of jews in banking which I think is just true. There's a lot of historical and material circumstances that lead to that. And this was all being discussed because NC said that having an ethical system is idealism for some reason.

		* 🟧 **[imgladimnothim](https://www.reddit.com/user/imgladimnothim)** ⬆️ 1 _(2022-06-08 00:38:48)_

			Well we were you know.... we were required by regents of many, many places to doal out loans with interest on behalf of the regents to other people because christians werent allowed to give interest building loans to other christians, so jews were forced(by the alternate being death) to do so. I agree that vaush's representation was not just oversimplified but antisemitic, buts at the core of it, its true. We WERE over represented, but now that outright jewish oppression, at least as a matter of law, has ended, we no longer are. But for a long time, the trade a jewish father would teach to his son was finance, because that would be what he was forced into in his life, and if the son was able to break off from the royal system, what he knew best was how to bank. This wasnt all jews by any means of course, only a fraction, but when your religion is the only one allowed(and only one forced) to handle finances, of course there's going to be a disproportionate amount of your people involved in the trade. On top of that, jews were so hated they basically were banned from any other trades within non-jewish communities. "Court jew" was the term used, if you want a starting place to read the history.

	Trying to list some stuff I haven't seen much, in loose order of approachability until the end bit

	Breaking Points, Redacted Tonight and Hard Lens Media -  

	Hardly communists but some more leftish anti-mainstream-narrative news programs that are very watchable and present the issues well.  

	&amp;nbsp;

	the Gravel Institute -   

	 kind of in the same liberal-adjacent realm but with informative cartoons with a bunch of guest stars.  

	&amp;nbsp;

	Richard Wolff -  

	a similarly great introductory commentator but some more explicitly marxist leanings, more directly addressing the audience and responding to questions  

	&amp;nbsp;

	I don't think I've seen NonCompete mentioned much -  

	Similar anarchist liberal-adjacent content to Thought Slime, but also like thought slime is more entertaining and funny, and his relationship with Luna Oi has allowed him to become a little more radical and share some theory. In some ways I guess you could consider it the 

	&amp;nbsp;

	Useful I*iots (historical phrase censored for the autobot lol), Jackson Hinckle -  

	 good leftist commentary with a little more 'fun', lots of dunking on bad media takes and liberals

	&amp;nbsp;

	Some controversial suggestions that you won't hear much because they will start a huge fight but you should definitely judge for yourself -  

	Angie Speaks,

	The Convo Couch, 

	The Jimmy Dore Show,

	The Grayzone,

	Moderate Rebels,

	On Contact with Chris Hedges

	&amp;nbsp;

	Most importantly **none of this is a replacement for reading theory** or catching old-school figures like Michael Parenti. At some point it's kinda necessary.

								opposing capitalism in *rhetoric* and opposing actually implementing communism in *practice* is a classic liberal technique
								
								last sentence is some real center-of-the-venn-diagram stuff.
								
								There are some perfectly based anarchists out there, don't get me wrong. There are also a bunch who haven't done the intellectual lifting and are just liberals with extra steps. It is easier to be a liberal "anarchist" than a liberal Marxist-Leninist or whatever. That doesn't necessarily mean anarchism is 'wrong', but it just is what it is, there's a reason for the stereotype.

						It's easier to accuse than be objective and forthright with the criticism. I wish more people understood this doesn't help at all. I have helped a few Marxists and even anarchists along the way with constructive criticism and they have helped me too. We should attempt some form of civil discourse and be intellectually honest enough either way to be open to learning from each other. I am afraid anarchists will be up next on the chopping block if Marxists somehow pull off a revolution against global capitalism. Look at how Mahkno and the Free Army were treated by Lenin and anarchists were treated there after in the USSR. The hive-mindedness of some that claim M-L or Maoist Communism is concerning.

						* 🟫 **[deleted]** ⬆️ 2 _(2022-01-17 10:03:34)_

		+1 on The serfs. They are genuinely comfy viewing if you're a progressive on any side of the political spectrum.

		Aren’t thoughtslime and serfs libs? Tell me if I’m wrong. I thought I remember them saying they weren’t Marxists or something that eluded they were antithetical to Marxism.

	Socialist Swann is a good one. Smaller YouTuber but they talk about the GDR and life under socialism, including it’s flaws. A good get away from the constant depressing realizations that other YouTubers provide.

	Don’t think I’ve seen his name on here but Noel Samsen is great. He actually does a couple of list based videos on leftist YouTube which are really well edited.

	Hakim, Yugoppnik, and Second Thought should supply you with more than enough content, but for more Spooky Scary Socialist, Viki 1999, and Marxist Paul are great. I would also suggest "The Deprogram" podcast, which is on all platforms you can find podcasts. It has the first three people I mentioned in it, and it's a great mix of hilarious and educational.

	i started with more radical content and then found philosophy tube and contrapoints. my favorite ancom radical youtuber is Noncompete, a dude from the usa now living in vietnam. he is an interesting character especially with art interpretation but the content is pretty solid in the right videos.
