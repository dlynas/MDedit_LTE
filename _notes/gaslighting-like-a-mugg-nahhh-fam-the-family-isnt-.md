"There's no Biden voters in the House, right?
No.
Okay, good.
Okay.
Things I guess will change over time because you do have to only pick one candidate at the
end of the day.
But the Kennedy voter and the Trump voter, the enemy, our mutual enemy is Biden.
Since Biden is counting on us with Bobby in the mix, my thought is for the Republicans.
See, Bobby right now he's pulling from both sides.
Right now he's actually pulling a little bit more from Biden, which explains what the
DNC is kind of ganging up on him.
They have a special committee to go after independent candidates.
Yeah, they say independent candidates like non-affiliated candidates, they really need
Bobby.
Because Bobby is the only third party that anybody is taking seriously.
So they developed a committee just to go after him and to get him off of the ballot.
In any way they can.
Especially, it seems as though they're going after the battleground states more than the
de-Blue states.
Bobby's moving the blues on his own.
If the Republicans accepted the fact that New York, Maryland, Chicago, Illinois, California,
New Jersey, Connecticut, most of the Northeast is going to go blue.
Why wouldn't we put our vote to Bobby and at least get rid of Biden and
get those 28 electoral votes in New York?
The card's a little wrong.
It says 26 electoral votes.
Give those 28 electoral votes to Bobby rather than to Biden thereby reducing
Biden's 270.
And we all know how that works, right?"
