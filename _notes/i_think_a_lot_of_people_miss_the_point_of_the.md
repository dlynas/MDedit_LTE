## I think a lot of people miss the point of 'The ones who walk away from Omelas'

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1c30htq/i_think_a_lot_of_people_miss_the_point_of_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1c30htq/i_think_a_lot_of_people_miss_the_point_of_the/)

> Whenever this story is brought up almost everyone seems to interpret it as a moral dilemma, asking the reader: Would you want this child to suffer for the collective happiness? But IN MY OPINION, I think that's not even close to just what the author is trying to ask. If not it would pretty much just be an upscaled version of the trolley problem. I think in actuality the story is a deconstruction of the idea that joy can only come with pain, that a society that doesn't rely on someone's suffering can't exist. And I also think the story is trying to hold a mirror up to the reader to show us how ridiculous it is that we think a society without major pain isn't possible.
> 
> Here is something the author points out near the beginning of the story: "The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain [...] We can no longer describe a happy man, nor make any celebration of joy." She then keeps describing this heavenly town before saying this: "Do you believe? Do you accept the festival, the city, the joy? No? Then let me describe one more thing." Most people are conditioned to believe that someone needs to suffer for this world to go round. So she adds in this child that needs to get tortured for the citizens to keep their joy. Suddenly the story is more believable to us, and we are more easily immersed into this world. I think this is the first question the story asks us: Why is a society with only happiness more unimaginable to us than one where a child needs to get randomly tortured?"
> 
> I think the people that walk away from Omelas aren't abandoning society to live in the woods Ted Kaczynski style, they're leaving because they envision something most of us can't: a better city, where all the same joy is possible, but no child is tortured. At multiple points she describes somewhere where there is only joy as "unimaginable", and again at the end she says this: "The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible that it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas."
> 
> So all in all it kind of bothers me when people jump to saying that they would stay in Omelas. Because most of the people who say this seem to accept at face value that this child needs to get tortured for the collective happiness. And while this is certainly true for the city of Omelas, the story also hints very strongly at there being other, better cities where there is no pointless suffering.
> 
> Obviously there is a clear parallel between Omelas and our world. In real life there are people that suffer to make other people's lives easier. In real life there are some (capitalism enjoyers, perhaps) who know about child labor, slavery, exploitation, but they don't try to change it, because they think that it's the best system possible, and that this immense suffering is necessary, They've seen the child, and they choose to stay in Omelas. But here is where the metaphor gets blurred for most: In real life you can't really "walk away" from society. So I think the way that walking away from Omelas translates to real life, is those who try to make society better, those who envision a system where children don't have to suffer and exploitation doesn't need to take place. But this type of change (revolutionary, perhaps), is certainly less assured than the stable mix of pain and pleasure we currently have. As the author puts it: "They leave Omelas, they walk ahead into the darkness, and they do not come back." And the way I interpret it, they might either find a wonderful new city where all the same joy is possible but no one has to suffer, or they will find something worse than Omelas, but it's probably worth a try.

	A story can do more than one thing at once. Omelas as moral philosophy lesson isn’t just a valid reading, it’s one that [Le Guin herself](https://www.awpwriter.org/magazine_media/writers_chronicle_view/2293/an_interview_with_ursula_k._le_guin) endorsed: “It poses a classic moral problem very clearly.”

	The story is also a vehicle for literary criticism (or meta-criticism), describing the way that utopianism in literature (and a literature of positivity, hopefulness, nonviolence, etc. more broadly) is denigrated, disregarded, dismissed as “unserious.” There are political and psychological dimensions to this line of argument, too, but I think it’s *mostly* an argument about the critical and popular response to fiction, especially genre fiction. More relevant now, in the era of ubiquitous dreary apocalyptic misery, then ever before!

	It’s *also* a pretty straightforward political allegory. Le Guin was an anarchist; Omelas is a far-left attack on liberalism and social democracy. Omelas isn’t fascist, it isn’t totalitarian, it isn’t a hyper-capitalist hellscape. It isn’t the United States. It’s an ideal social democracy. It’s Norway. And Norway and Norwegian social democracy, to an anarchist, are still unacceptable. Norway’s prosperity and peace and egalitarianism depend on both massive fossil-fuel wealth and the exploitation and exclusion of billions of poor people outside Norway, who make Norwegians’ smartphones and flat-pack furniture and cheap clothes, etc. There is no version of capitalism that does not depend on somebody, somewhere (realistically, billions of somebodies) being exploited, abused, and immiserated. 

	(Norwegians: sorry to pick on you. We’re all guilty!)

		On the point of misery and dystopias being more popular in fiction than happiness and utopias: I think a lot of it comes down to the fact that art is a vehicle for expressing an artist's emotions, and artists are people: they hurt just as much as everyone else. Some create happy and safe art for escapist pueposes, because it helps them. Others create dark art to work through their own emotions and vent their frustrations with the world, because it helps them, too. When people hurt (and everyone hurts from time to time), they either want to be comforted by a happier visage, or they want to be comforted by recognising their own pain in someone else's work. I've been on both ends of this line, both as an artist and as an enjoyer of art. One just has to find what fits them, specifically... But then some people will try to demean one and elevate the other, because their black and white thinking presents them from seeing the nuance of how different types of art help different people. 
		
		Children will usually be kept away from darker art, especially nowadays. Classic fairy tales will have the darker bits cut out, a happy ending is mandatory, and, unless the child happens to be both able and willing to interact with art beyond the expectations set for their age, they are likely to grow up on exclusively happy stuff. 
		
		For a parent, that's easier: who wants to console a child for an hour because a dog in a film died, and the heaviness of realising that  loss exists is beginning to set in in their young mind? However, one cannot control what the child sees forever. They will become a teen, and with adolescence comes relative freedom, and also the need to rebel. They finally discover that darker art does exist, get exposed to it, and then it sometimes comes down to the two extremes: they either love it or hate it. Those who have clicked with it will make it part of their teenage rebellion: they are the proverbial edgy teens who make bloody edits of cartoon characters and cut up plush toys to look like the characters from Hellraiser. For some, it stays superficial, a way to vent; others will go on to get immersed into makabre art and call happy art superficial, because it just does not resonate with them anymore, it does not "get" them. 
		
		The kids who hate dark art, though, will go on to denounce the first crowd I've described as future serial killers and promoters of every unhealthy behaviour under the sun. They will surround themselves with the aesthetics of the childhood they are about to leave behind and dread "ruining" it by inviting the horrors of real life into their sanctuary. For both, it's a part of growing up and figuring themselves out. For both, such dedication to art, either dark or happy, can be a healing experience. Some will grow up and realize that both are necessary and good, actually, and that even things that aren't here to help you are here to help someone else, and should be respected as such. Others will never admit that they were wrong when they insulted that other kid for reading "a dumb kiddie book" or "an edgy misery porn". Sometimes, different tastes and needs existing just does not compute in people's heads, and it comes down to manu separate issies, from authoritarian upbringing to an overblown sense of self-importance. 
		
		Many people out there still enjoy both wishful utopias and the scratching commentary of dystopias, but the people who have nothing negative to say are oftentimeds, sadly, the most quiet of the bunch, especially online. You will see more people hating on one or the other, but that's because haters are loud. People who enjoy or at least respect both are too busy reading all the wonderful books out there to spend time slandering a genre they dislike.

			I've noticed that there has been a strong trend to darker young adult fiction.  I can't really see books like The Hunger Games or The Graveyard Book being published as teen fiction in say 1950 for example.  Young adult seems to have had an unprecedented trend toward grim topics.  I've found this trend to be rather worrisome actually.

			* 🟦 **[Rein_Deilerd](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rein_Deilerd)** ⬆️ 13 _(2024-04-13 19:26:20)_

				I wouldn't say it's worrisome. People have always been attracted to exploring darker topics in fiction, and it is especially true for young people, who are still discovering themselves and how they relate to the world. Experiencing hardships that might await them throughout adolescence (grief, loss, conflicts, complex decisions, taking responsibility for their mistakes) in a controlled environment of fiction is a great way to become acquainted with them, and kids are specifically drawn towards horror as a way to experienced thrills without the risks of actual harm and getting over their phobias. 
				
				Neil Gaiman's books are especially well-known for tackling the topics of childhood fears and how to fight them and make peace with them; sure, Coraline scared me as a small child, but it also taught me invaluable lessons about facing my fears and being strong for the sake of those I care about. I might not be a die-hard fan who has read everything Gaiman, but I do treasure this one book dearly. 
				
				Meanwhile, dystopian novels such as The Hunger Games resonate with teenagers and above due to tackling the existing unease and frustration with the faults of the modern world. Class inequality, governing through fear and violence, innocents becoming casualties in political conflicts - these topics are all very real, and with the Internet at their service, a modern-day teen can learn about the current world events much easier than a teen in the fifties, and become filled with desire for change - which is why reading stories about other teens who fight for justice and tear down corrupted governments feels so cathartic. 
				
				Negative aspects of life cannot be ignored or hidden away. Kids and teenagers don't want to feel alone, they often want to see their pain recognized, to have a conversation about a topic that is too taboo or too sensitive to bring up with mom and dad. Sure, some kids find horror or violent deaths to be too much, and find comfort in safe and fluffy escapist fiction, and that is a valid way to interact with art, too - I, myself, have found untold warmth and wisdom in the Moominvalley and in the town of Koriko, because light-hearted and positive fiction can still be deep, touching and thought-provoking. However, different needs are met by different fiction. Some bodily ills are treated by putting on a soothing gel and staying in bed. Others are treated by taking a scalpel and cutting the body open to remove the source of the illness. The second option involves blood and sharp objects, it should not be imitated at home, and it won't do anything good for a scrapped knee, but many people out there need surgeries, and many others need dark fiction to comfort them.
				
				As for why books for younger audiences used to be different half a century ago... Well, times were different. There was much stricter censorship in all kinds of art, from comic books to film to children's literature. Artististic freedom was much more limited. The entertainment industry as a whole was not the way it is today, and that involves books meant for entertainment purposes, too. Some genres that are popular now were making their first steps out in the wild. Lord of the Rings was first published in 1954, and it is hard to imagine modern-day YA fantasy of both the sweet and the grim kinds existing without its influence. 
				
				However, today we have a huge variety of books to choose from. We have cute romances and friendships, adventure books, dystopias, horror lit, queer representation, books about race, gender, about societal ills and taboo topics, with writers such as Jacqueline Wilson tackling extremely complex and dark subject matters in her children's books. Kids have never been stupid; they understand that the world can be a dark place, and some are drawn to exploring it through fiction. 
				
				Teens are also more aware than ever now that there are political conflicts, wars and injustices going on in the world, since you can look up all the latest world conflict news from you phone instantly, so of course they are drawn to dystopias - they are horrified and overwhelmed by practically living in one, and want to immerse themselves in a story which acknowledges their pain, but also lifts them up by showing the noble teen protagonists making the change. It gives the teen some form of control, some form of closure - it's what a bullied kid feels when they read a book about another kid standing up to their bullies. Grim art often is, at the end of the day, still filled with hope and a drive for a better future, it simply does not shy away from the dragons that have to be slain, making the victory much more meaningful.

					I said it was worrisome, I should have provided some context.  I noticed this probably 20 years ago, and I remember explaining to my mother how dark young adult literature had become.  I wasn't concerned that it was going to be a bad influence or anything of that sort.  It's the opposite.  It's a yardstick of what the kids then saw in their lives, and what troubled them.  What was yesterday's cultural trend has become a generation of 20 somethings with a deep sense of alienation, cynicism, and pessimism. And this is not without reason, of course.   You can read about this stuff in sociology or economics, in surveys or statistics like household formation.   They say all things end, and I hope it is soon, but it seems to deepening year after year, and I am yet to see an end in sight.

						While I do agree that the constant pressure of the digital age that our brains have not yet adapted to is taking its toll on the new generation, and their tastes in art reflect that, I would also say that a cerain amount of young people, especially teens, will always lean towards the more cynical side at some point in their development. It comes with the loss of childhood naivete, with a broadening sense of responsibility and a hard time adjusting to the changes of adolescence. 
						
						Of course, young people nowadays are not only bombarded with negativity online, they are also isolated by the late-stage capitalism of the society they live in - you need a car to go anywhere, there are little to no places to hang out for free, and you will be kicked out at 18, so you better spend all your free time working or studying for college. Add in the pandemic, and you get one very tired and struggling generation... Still, I don't think this is all there is to the situation. 
						
						20 years ago, I was 9, and so were most of my friends. We were not yet a digital generation, most didn't even have a PC at home (Eastern Europe, not sure how it was in the US). World conflicts were still a distant news broadcast that grandpa watches on TV sometimes, not something to be passionate about. And yet, we were still drawn to darker topics. We read R.L. Stine and watched horror movies that we were too young for. We were making up our fist stories, which often involved pretty twisted happenings - we were too young to feel the true scope of what we were make-believing about, but the  thrill and excitement of an uncharted territory was definitely there. 
						
						There is a reason why kids tend to get hooked on stuff like Poppy Playtime and then draw the scary characters all friendly and cuddlty in their notebooks - befriending the scary monster and conquering your fears is an age-long natural instinct for a kid, and rebelling against the warm confines of family-friendliness is just ad natural for a teenager. It's just that before, there was a much stricter censorship around everything. There was the Satanic panic, there was a war on violent video games, ans before all that, there was the Hays code. The book industry, especially books meant for kids, suffered from that, too - the kids who wanted and needed to read and speak about their woes simply did not have an outlet. 
						
						It's not like teens only became cynical or depressed after the 21st century kicked in - they are just more open and more online about it. I know there were people like me or like the current teens in my parents' and my grandparents' generations, too, but they couldn't really show it to anyone until adulthood. Young Adult as a specific branch of literature, a bridge between children and adults, is not that old of a concept in its modern-day form, and a book meant for 16-25 year olds will obviously be allowed to get away with much more than a book for 10 year olds. The state of modern-day teenagers is, of course, alarming, with them so isolated from each other and making themselves so vulnerable online. However, I am sure that, if censorship laws back in the day were different, we could have gotten more books similar to what we have today. The censorship laws in Soviet Union were different for sure, and some of the children's books we have... Pretty damn intense, which might have also come from generations of trauma and the lack of clear distinction between "adult" prose and "children's" prose at a time and place where books in general are scarce.

		Yes, it poses a classic moral problem very clearly,  but also it also  quite clearly implies that "living in Omelas" is not the morally correct route to take. It portrays a debate  but also comes down very obviously against  one particular position on that debate.

			this is just absurd, by your definition a medieval serfdom is also capitalism 
			
			capitalism specifically refers to privates owning the means of production and being allowed to use them with some degree of freedom, as opposed to economic systems where those means are owned and regulated by nobles, kings, or other social classes. 
			
			its your definition of capitalism that is just silly, because it's so vague to be effectively useless. capitalism is not the same as an agrarian economy or a command economy, even if in all of those people trade with each other.

			I did not intend for you to read my comment so literally, just like Le Guin did not intend for us to read her story so literally. I'm not saying "Omelas is actually Norway." I'm saying that, for Le Guin, Omelas represents the Platonic version of the society that liberals and social democrats strive toward—it's not actually an attainable state. She's saying that even a *utopian* capitalism still depends on abuse and exploitation (and thus isn't actually utopian).
			
			I used Norway as an example because, fifty years later, the United States is a complete garbage fire—no longer a functional social democracy, and arguably no longer even a liberal democracy. Norway, by contrast, is pretty nice.

					And that’s true. Norway may be less exploitative and cruel than the US, but they engage in a non-zero amount thereof which is still insufficient in Le GUIN’s mind, because she’s trying to get to actual utopia instead of accepting we can’t

							I feel like you're going out of your way to misunderstand me, but let me try again: When I say that Omelas isn't the United States, I'm making a contemporary reading. In 1973, the U.S. was by far the wealthiest country in human history, our welfare state was at its approximate zenith, and the reach of social liberalism (i.e., civil libertarianism) was approaching its peak. *At that time,* the U.S. was the closest thing in the world to Omelas.
							
							Today, it's not. We're no longer an exceptionally rich country, our welfare state has been almost completely dismantled, and we've (more recently) passed our civil-libertarian peak and are backsliding into illiberalism and authoritarianism. The security services murder hundreds or thousands of people each year; thousands or tens of thousands starve; women's rights are at their lowest ebb in 50 years; drugs and suicide are epidemic; etc. People no longer look at the U.S. as the closest thing in the world to an ideal society.
							
							"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" was obviously situated in the U.S. in various senses ("Omelas" itself is just "Salem, O"—as in "Salem, Oregon"—backwards), but it's a timeless work of literature. It's not anchored to its geographic origin; we can do a little digging and understand that Le Guin had her own home in mind when she wrote, but there's no explicit reference to the U.S. in the text, by design. It's meant to be universal, and it is.
							
							Today, various other countries make more apt comparisons for Omelas than the U.S. does, but of course Omelas isn't meant to be literal to begin with, and isn't meant to map onto any one city or state then or now. Omelas is just a metaphor for a particular vision of how society "should" function.
							
							Le Guin was always cagey about declaring a specific political ideology. She was an anti-capitalist, an anti-authoritarian, a pacifist, and a Taoist. She made it clear that all her sympathies were with anarchism (or anarcho-communism, left libertarianism, libertarian socialism, whatever you want to call it), but she demurred when people tried to claim her as one, saying things like, "I love them, but I am a bourgeois housewife; I don’t practice anarchism."

					Let's imagine for a second that there were anywhere on Earth today that we could fairly call "a society of material abundance and luxury…beyond the dreams of kings," where poverty and hunger have been eradicated. We might call that place "Norway." *Or,* if we'd actually read the story everybody here is talking about, we might call it "Omelas."
					
					(In fact, of course, even in Norway a significant minority of people live in poverty, and a much smaller but still nonzero number are starving. It is quite nice, however, for the vast majority. In Norway. At the expense of a far larger number of people everywhere else in the world.)

								Has it stopped you and your friends from buying Apple products, though? And is there a genuine alternative? And if not, are you willing to forgo a smartphone? And what if you need the smartphone for work and without it you can't pay your rent?

								Let's say we know that all smartphone production involves exploitative labour and we're all using smartphones while wanking on about how the only moral choice is to walk away from Omelas. Wouldn't that be some irony?

								But a devil's advocate is that maybe there is some arrogance in this position and the denunciation of other things as bad. 
								
								If we really put our money where our mouth is, would we really be on the internet or Reddit? 
								
								And if we weren't, can we *really* escape consumption that's associated with some kind of exploitation or another? Short of everyone going off grid and becoming self sufficient, and even then?
								
								If not, should perhaps everyone practice some level of humility, not only a perceived barbarian who has dared to say capitalism is not bad?
								
								This is devil's advocate - I was only just earlier in a thread where people were giving gentrification the big ups. Reddit isn't exactly consistent
								
								I just find social media tends to skew to extremes. Clearly there's a lot of lefties in this thread.
								
								And I mean, if you can't or don't walk away, then what? Can you act as though you have the morality of one who has, just through theoretical rejection alone? Could it be argued that *would* be a form of arrogance? Maybe that argument is not as flimsy as it seems

			So your opinion is unpopular here and I personally don't agree with it, but can I ask you what your reasoning is for saying that? For me personally, capitalism by definition depends on inequity. It can't be equal (edit, accidentally pressed save before I even decided if I wanted to keep the comment) and nor is this the goal, quite the opposite.
			
			 This doesn't mean to say that there's no such thing as the concept and perhaps more rarely the existence of ethical business (although "greenwashing" etc are also criticisms of this). 
			
			Could I ask what do you believe is nonsense about the above statement? For example, I don't believe the world as it currently runs (in 2024) can't function as it does if Chinese labourers weren't working in conditions that would be illegal in the West, while we rely on their labour. 
			
			It's not like I've done a degree in political science per se, but prior to current conditions we also had labour laws in the West that - oh, I mean, I'm sure you know what I'm saying, child labour, dangerous conditions etc etc and we do still have sweatshops now in first world countries and sex trafficking and so on where the average person isn't even aware of it. 
			
			Is your objection to the above statement the imperative that someone must be treated in a subpar manner for profit making business activities? 
			
			Because surely you wouldn't suggest capitalism as a system doesn't both historically and contemporarily include such conditions? 
			
			If you would, can I please ask, what are you thinking? 
			
			Ok, I can see a message below about a supercomputer and a belief that capitalism has been associated with eradication of poverty and hunger. Hm. Do you mean in contrast to feudalism and socialism? What exactly has capitalism done to end poverty? We have the secular state, the welfare state, charity and philanthropy. We have the idea of a level playing field, a meritocracy. Can I ask what is capitalism doing to solve world hunger outside of philanthropy?
			
			I can't see it. I get you're frustrated with "capitalism bad" and probably a hivemind in the thread (I find subs and posts often skew to one extreme or another). But what are some solid examples of capitalism specifically helping people? I can see how you would argue that compared to feudalism honestly, and I myself would rather the devil I know, and I'm glad I'm not a serf, but I think we pretty much still have serf-like equivalents in late capitalism. 
			
			If you have the energy I would probably appreciate a reasoned, respectful exchange on this despite the non-aligning viewpoints.

	Your reading is far more consistent with Le Guin's other work than the usual "trolley problem" reading. She was a pretty radical political leftist/anarchist who wrote some science fiction books (such as The Dispossessed, The Word for World is Forest, and The Eye of the Heron) which were explicitly about presenting alternatives to the assumptions we usually make about politics. Even her fantasy, like The Tombs of Atuan, often features people questioning the foundational elements of their society and coming to reject their society's assumptions about what is and is not possible, often after realizing that those assumptions are causing some deep harm. 

	Your reading is also more consistent with this famous quote from her speech at the 2014 National Book Awards: "We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words."

	In that context, it's very hard for me to believe that Le Guin wrote this story simply to ask readers "would you accept the suffering of the child, or would you leave Omelas?" and I find readings of the story in that mode to be pretty surface level and inattentive to the first half of the story. I think she's challenging the limits of our imagination, as you say. She's illustrating how inescapable the foundational harms of our world feel (such as capitalism) by highlighting the fact that we struggle to imagine even a fantasy world existing without some kind of suffering at the heart of it.

	It’s also interesting in that Omelas is set up within the text as just a thought problem - it’s not real, ever, and the fact that Le Guin asks us to put our own favourite things in it that might buck the fairytale image of a utopian society (like drugs or orgies) just helps reinforce the message that Omelas is a fiction. 

	I didn’t read Omelas when I was young, so I only came to it after seeing people talk about how messed up it was and how it had really left this giant impact on them. Lots of discussion about the Child and the “correct” response and the bleakness of it all. 

	So I was genuinely very surprised when I finally got round to reading it and I discovered that there was a whole first half - of the author talking to the reader - that none of its readers online seemed to discuss at all. The visceral horror of the child’s fate (or the response to walk away) had totally eclipsed the rest of the text. 

	And I think this fixation with the fate of the child is an example of where thought-experiments and utilitarianism kind of go awry. Omelas is absorbing because it offers us a kind of satisfaction in the horrible stakes it sets up: one child is horrendously neglected so that everyone else in that society doesn’t. You can quibble about the terms — where does the child come from? Does the child remain young forever? If not, where does it go when it becomes too old (or dies)? — but the fact that the only other response in this story is to walk away from Omelas just confirms that it’s pointless. In Omelas, nothing can alleviate this situation. You stay and benefit from the child suffering, or you leave. Neither of the reader’s hypothetical decisions here makes any tangible difference to the situation. 

	As you point out, our societies today are much worse than Omelas. Many more children suffer far worse than that single child in Omelas, and we enjoy far less social cohesion or benefits from this pain than the Omelas residents do. From this perspective, upgrading to a society like Omelas might even be a net positive; reducing all the world’s suffering down to a single (insignificant) being would massively improve the quality of life for almost everyone. Even the ones who walk away would’ve enjoyed a secure and happy childhood before they burn their bridges. I think this is where the Omelas-supporters are coming from; if walking away makes no difference, and does not help the child, leaving is futile and increases the amount of suffering in the world. 

	But the problem with these responses is that they indulge in the luxury of certainty, even as they frame it as a problem. Because Omelas is a story, we know that you can’t really have an Omelas without the basement-kid; it would stop being Omelas (either because the removal of the sacrificial child would doom the perfection of the rest of it, or because without a basement-kid Omelas isn’t recognisable from any other utopian city). 

	In reality, we don’t have certainty for any trolley problem or basement kid. Wanting to twist yourselves in knots about it is a nice problem to want to have; there are no real situations wherein we know the future outcome for sure and can spend endless time debating the correct options. Omelas exists in a capsule: if we put it into reality, it just breaks down.

		* 🟧 **[sunflowerroses](https://www.reddit.com/user/sunflowerroses)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-14 10:05:16)_

			Thank you! 
			
			I'm not entirely sure how to account for the logistics of the child. I think as soon as you try to consider it, Omelas starts to break apart again and I lose the forest for the trees. If I get caught up in the individual details of how the child is abused (or sustained), I think I put myself in the same situation as the Omelas-optimisers (who put forward theories like "what if the child could be put into a coma" or "what if the child could be medically rewired to suffer less pain"). 
			
			There was a recent viral story about Omelas by **Isabel J Kim** in Clarkesworld which I have to recommend. It's free online and fantastic. 
			
			I think the details that we *do* get about the child - that it (a) once had a loving childhood, and remembers, faintly, goodness and love (b) is regarded by members of the enlightened society of Omelas to be 'beyond recuperation' and would not be able to appreciate its own rescue and (c) once knew how to speak, and has lost this skill - suggest that there has been a child locked away for many decades. Le Guin suggests that there have been multiple generations of Omelas-residents, including those who have come of age, raised their own children, and then have had to acknowledge this horror between themselves. 
			
			I'm not sure if this suggests a succession of Omelas-children, or if there is a single person who is stuck in a childlike regressed state, and is still recognised as 'a child' in the story. 
			
			Both break the premise of Omelas; either Omelas is built on the suffering of multiple children, who regularly die and must be replaced, or the 'child' is actually an adult, and we have different attitudes towards the suffering of adults than we do children. If the child can't age via magic or utopian super-science of some kind, then the mundane horror of the mechanism of abuse - neglect and imprisonment in an otherwise ordinary basement - is undercut. 
			
			Childhood in Omelas is a protected state, maintained by the safeguarding of all children (but one) as well as their innocence and naivety, completely. Adolescence is marked by the loss of these things as they are made aware - deliberately so, and only by necessity once - of the basement-child. After this, they are not children. 
			
			I think it's interesting that Omelas refuses to let its other children know about the basement-child. Maybe this is part of the safeguarding; the moral shock of the child's situation would be traumatic, and being forced to handle the same level of knowledge as their adolescent peers might leave them isolated or stunted in their maturation. 
			
			But it's also a sort of defence-mechanism for apathy. Omelas-residents *only* discover the basement-child at the precise point they stop existing in the same demographic as the child. They lose the ability to identify with the child, and they're offered a way to escape the immediate fear of "what if I was the basement-child" by maturing and taking advantage of the intellectual and emotional development the child is unable to.
			
			If all the Omelas-children knew about the basement-child, their lives would be marked by a very terrible and sobering burden. Some of them would leave before their adulthood. Omelas' ability to declare itself a utopia lies in its ability to protect nearly all of the childhoods of its occupants, and we also understand the horror of its situation in that it cannot protect *all* the childhoods of its occupants. 
			
			But the Omelas-children might also have... some complaints? They might want to know if they're also at risk of being put into the basement; they might want to know the difference between their own position and that of the basement-child came about; they might even feel cheated or betrayed or patronised by the adults in their lives, who kept this knowledge from them *for their own good*, in the same way the child is kept in the basement *for everyone else's good*. Maybe the children are kept in the dark about this truth for everyone else's good as well. So Omelas breaks down again. 
			
			I don't know what happens to the basement-child afterwards, but I would have to think that whatever happens does so in secrecy. I don't think it's productive to speculate further; wondering about undertakers or burial or long-term care is just undeniably grim and it distracts from the core dilemma. Both 'caring for an extremely disabled adult' or 'disposing of a body in a sanitary and socially-appropriate manner' are lesser problems that can be solved. 
			
			IJ Kim's story is one that I think really embraces Omelas-logistics to their nastiest and fullest extent in a way that also seems to play with the ideas of imagination and childhood and dilemmas that the original does. 
			
			I realise these are sort of non-answers (and that this is a very long comment!), so I apologise for that, and I'd like to ask if you've got any opinions on the matter.

				Thank you for the reply! No worries about length. I enjoyed reading about your speculations! 
				
				My suspicion is I don't feel like it works if the child is kept in that state by magic? Partly because this detracts from the idea of a natural child, where childhood is but a brief state of inherent vulnerability, which is part of the mundane horror. If it's just an ancient child, I dunno. It's a bit different. So I agree, I think, at least that the child can't be ageless and has to be situated as a child. I think generations of imprisoned children whose demise or adulthood is dealt with in secrecy is less contrary to the overall concept. 
				
				"Both 'caring for an extremely disabled adult' or 'disposing of a body in a sanitary and socially-appropriate manner' are lesser problems that can be solved." Oof!
				
				Well here's an outlier - what if they freed the child? What if it only had to suffer during its use restricted to the terms of its age? I don't know if anything in particular would prevent this.
				
				But then how could it reintegrate and where else would it go?
				
				And of course this distracts from the moral quandary as a narrative device. 
				
				Still it's mildly interesting to imagine the grown child attempting to assimilate back into Omelas - 
				
				And even the attitude of a successfully integrated ex-child (if you will) to the "next generation". Would they take on a hegemonic attitude to their replacement? Would they seek to free them using their inside knowledge of weaknesses in the built environment? Would they too be prompted to get out of Dodge? 
				
				Thanks for the heads up about Kim's piece! I saw a reference to this and another story. I'm horrible at reading at the moment but I'll save this comment and come back to it! :D

	Okay, I just went back and re-read Omelas.

	Your general interpretation was mine as well: the story isn't primarily about a dystopia; it's about a conversation between the narrator and the reader.  The narrator believes that there needs to be some kind of evil or pain for the reader to believe in Omelas, so they *add* a child just as they encourage the reader to add or subtract technology according to what best helps them imagine the place.  

	People often assume you're *supposed* to identify with the ones who walk away.  That makes some sense if you believe it's about a moral dilemma, but that's less clear in a metatextual interpretation where rejecting Omelas is what led to the inclusion of the child in the first place.  The narrator leaves their destination ambiguous and doesn't really know where the walkers are going, only that they *seem* to have a destination they're heading for:

	>The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to most of us that the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible that it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.

	Once again, it's largely up to the reader to fill in the details as best they can imagine, but most readers who reject Omelas probably don't have an alternative in mind.  Like the narrator, they can't describe it at all.  I've seen people point out that the ones who walk away don't actually do anything to end the child's suffering.  Arguably then, this better destination *also* exists because of the child.  If not for their suffering, there would have been nothing to reject and none of these people would have left Omelas.  

	If it's up to the reader though, and the reader has already rejected the reality of "the city of happiness", they're probably headed for more of the same because any time they find Eden, the reader will be there to add a serpent.

	It's not that it is probably worth a try. The people who walk away have realized something that they cannot unknow. Where they go and what they do is impossible to know because Omelas is a closed society. But they cannot go back because there is no way of not knowing what they now know.

	It gets at the whole point of the story: Tales of pure happiness are dull and unrealistic, but so are tales of needless suffering. The real magic to write about is on those whose minds change, even when they should have no reason to do so.

	But I agree with you that there are additional interesting issues that the story asks, such as that which you bring up.

		I kinda like that take on the story, but it basically misses the point that Omelas is about, that there *is* nothing outside Omelas imaginable to the people who would stay there. No one could visit Omelas from elsewhere, because elsewhere doesn't exist (for the people who remain there). There is no suffering "out there" that Omelans could point to for why they need the child, because the point of the story is that "out there", the place no one who stays in Omelas can imagine, is *actually* perfect, that they have built an Omelas without the need for the child.

	I wonder, what makes you think that society without suffering can exist in real life? I find Omelas purely hypothetical.

	> So she adds in this child that needs to get tortured for the citizens to keep their joy. Suddenly the story is more believable to us

	Nope, it's still 100% unbelievable.

	Happiness isn't stupid and utopia isn't stupid. But people always had problems. Illnesses, death, resource scarcity, and so on and so forth. Good utopia (in my opinion) should show us how society would deal with these problems. I think it's similar to the falsifiability principle in science. To "prove" utopia, author should be able to look at it critically. Omelas is just a society where no problems arise. Which is completely understandable - after all, "The ones who walk away from Omelas" is a very short fable.

	To be clear, I am not criticising Le Guin - in The Disposessed she described two different societies with their own problems perfectly. As a result, a lot of people (myself included) would never want to live on Anarres.

	> In real life there are some (capitalism enjoyers, perhaps) who know about child labor, slavery, exploitation, but they don't try to change it, because they think that it's the best system possible, and that this immense suffering is necessary

	"The Disposessed" is only book that I've read that contains somewhat realistic description of post-capitalistic society (that's why I respect Le Guin very much).

		I just finished Dispossessed and share your respect for Le Guin on the basis of that book's honest look at what an anarchic society might look like. I would even live there over the planet myself.
		
		
		I would like to challenge you on a true utopia, or even Omelas, being 100% unbelievable though. Or rather, on being impossible, which I feel you are conflating with unbelievable. Personally, I also can't believe humans can exist without suffering but that doesn't mean it's true. As OP says, a major point of Omelas is that we can't imagine (believe) a society without suffering but Le Guin posits that eventually, some people will (those who walk away). And as Le Guin said, society without the divine right of kings was 100% unbelievable once too.

			I think that true utopia can be possible and believable, but Omelas is neither of them.
			
			
			> I also can't believe humans can exist without suffering but that doesn't mean it's true
			
			
			It also doesn't mean it's not true. And why would it matter, anyway? If "society without suffering" is just a vague concept, and we have no idea how this society would work and how to achieve it.
			
			
			I think I didn't explain my point clearly.
			
			
			Imagine a patriarchal society, for example. Not our patriarchal society, but ideal, perfect patriarchal society. Women can't vote or go to college, but they don't need it! They all happily stay at home and raise children, while all men are happily provide for them. Men are in charge, but since they are all perfect, no conflicts arise. They are happy to rule and women are happy to serve.
			
			
			Do you want to live in this society? There will be no misunderstanding , no crimes, no suffering. It is better than our society. It is perfect. At least, while we're not asking some awkward questions. Like, what would happen to people who refuse to comply. Or how can we be sure that no one would abuse their power. Or how can we be sure that all women are really happy to serve, since we don't see that in real life.
			
			
			That's what I feel when I'm reading about possible post-capitalistic societies. Their descriptions are always so vague and so uncritical (with the exception of "The Disposessed", but I wouldn't want to live here).
			
			
			> And as Le Guin said, society without the divine right of kings was 100% unbelievable once too
			
			
			So something was unbelievable, but later proved to be real. It doesn't mean that all unbelievable things are real. But that's not the issue. Let's say that society without capitalism would be real (I agree). The questions are if this society would be better (I think that's possible), and, if it would be, how this society would work (I have no idea).

				I agree usually the talk of non-capitalist options (or at least the kind I can understand as a layman) is frustratingly vague and therefore currently impossible to implement. The point I was trying to make is just that I (and OP, I believe) find the Omelas story to be an encouragement to keep trying to imagine how it would actually work. It sounds silly but I feel the story is saying, if you can't imagine, at least imagine imagining it. It does this by saying there are people who walk away, i.e. imagine utopia.
				
				
				I agree too that there is no guarantee such a society is possible but that's where Le Guin's personal optimism shows, in my interpretation. I often find it hard to share her optimism but Omelas at least makes me hopeful about it for a while.

	I thought of The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas as an allegory about Capitalism. In a capitalist model someone has to suffer the indignities and pain of doing the lowliest jobs with no comfort so that others can live a paradise away from the painful stuff. Example: As an American, I have never slaughtered an animal, but I eat meat. I love animals but not enough to stop eating meat. The butcher and the cow can both be considered the suffering child in this example. I am living in a paradise where I don’t have to be a butcher to get meat and when I interact with animals I don’t have to think about the experience of the slaughtered animal. I can pretend my meat grows on trees. There are many examples like this in a capitalist economy.

		this is something I have realized while reading the comments here: the "you can have it all and never suffer!" utopia is a kind of dream endpoint of the capitalist mind.  As she points out, it is nigh on unbelievable because it is effectively impossible within the bounds of human psychology.  So her simplistic "anarchist" utopia seems silly not only because, as you point out, someone's got to do the dirty work, but also because it is more or less derived from the system she's trying to get away from.  The flip side of this is that the act of trying to get to the impossible no-suffering place is useful-- by simply imagining and telling us of this utopian city, she has massively increased the joy-to-suffering ratio from our own world.  The ones who walk away are iterating her act of imagination by trying to do her one better (starting from a point of much lower suffering than she is, they seem to be able to imagine even less suffering).  Can the utopian impulse achieve its own stated aims?  I doubt it, but it can achieve a good deal of good in the world.

		Why assume they're not entitled to "comfort"? I'm a janitor -- surely one of the lowest jobs -- but because I'm a union member, I make a living wage and have excellent benefits. Nothing in capitalism prohibits workers from organizing and demanding their due. 
		
		Also, the dirty jobs will still have to be done under any other system.

		* 🟧 **[MattWindowz](https://www.reddit.com/user/MattWindowz)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-04-14 01:26:29)_

			In the modern capitalist system in the US and the west at large, a janitor in the US is not actually at the lowest rung. Not even all that close, really. Western capitalism has exported a large portion of its suffering. In 1928, United Fruit Company workers tried to organize in Colombia. Colombia, acting under duress from the US and United Fruit, sent in its military, who massacred countless workers and civilians.
			
			Now I understand that this may seem far back, but it's actually just one part of a larger story. Up until the 2000s, Chiquita was funding right wing paramilitary death squads to the tune of 1.7 million USD to harass, assault, and murder political opponents, trade unionists, and advocates for indigenous people. They still have made zero reparations and are being taken to court again this year to try to force that to happen. 
			
			Stories like this play out just about anywhere that capitalism reaches. Capitalists find the places where the people are the most desperate or the governments are most corrupt, and bend them to their will. Capitalism is predicated on infinite growth, which is only possible with either infinite resources (which we don't have) or progressively greater exploitation of labor. Even within the US itself, corporations like Trader Joe's and SpaceX are trying to destroy the NLRB- which would kneecap most unions.
			
			It's important to understand that capitalism is not bound by national borders, and that capitalist corporations will always seek to grow to such a size that they are not bound by the will of any one nation.

				Is it valid for me to argue that just maybe we could blame the banana republic murdering on the capitalists who came up with the strategy and carried it out, more so than on capitalism itself? Suppose we were to abolish the system, that would imply its replacement with another system. 
				
				Suppose we imprison or eliminate these psychopathic individuals: There will eventually be another to rise up in the ranks under the new world order, whatever form that would take, and perpetrate some form of abuse. 
				
				I see it more as a problem inherent to human nature (that is to say, were you to ask the psychopath murderer why, they would matter of factly reply, "because it was fun.")
				
				To that extent then, the issue is coming up with more effective ways to limit abuse from happening in general, maybe some form of socialism has a better record than capitalism and communism in this regard I guess. This leads to the inextricable morass that is the notion that a system that aims to protect the vulnerable cannot exist without infringing on everyone's freedoms.
				
				Or maybe we get lucky and find a genetic correlation to psychopathy and then we'd get to sink our teeth into the juicy quandary of whether it'd be ethical to employ eugenics on that. If it were possible to eliminate psychopaths and antisocials from the gene pool, maybe that would help humans make it past the self-annihilation great filter and go forth to conquer the galaxy, but from a certain perspective, spreading out like wildfire to suck dry all natural resources in the galaxy may well be the worst thing ever to happen to it.

					I would argue that it isn't valid, no. Capitalism will inevitably lead to issues like this because it encourages it- find the lowest cost supplier, no matter what. Individuals with power within the system can choose not to do that, but if that leads to lower profits, investors will often stop supporting them, because they only know that the amount of money they're getting is smaller. Capitalism self-selects for the people with the least morals and qualms about crushing others rising to the top. Like I mentioned, SpaceX is one of the companies trying to destroy the NLRB- the richest man in the world wants to be able to pay his workers less and demand more. Yes, all systems that we've come up with have the potential for abuse, but capitalism is one of the only ones that absolutely requires it to function.

							"Evidently" is a bit of a stretch on that. I'm aware that Forbes made that estimate, but their reasoning was that they counted state-owned enterprises as his personal wealth. That's already a massive stretch, and they also cite anonymous sources to assert he was embezzling. We have no evidence of that beyond Forbes, a capitalist magazine with a vested interest in supporting capitalism. While it's certainly possible he did, to assert it as fact is, in my opinion, putting far more weight on that report than it deserves.
							
							Aside from that, though, that self-selection isn't nearly as strong. You're picking anecdotes. One bad person achieving power doesn't mean much compared to a system that effectively universally gives exploitative people the most power. Nearly every single politician in the US is bought by private interests, nearly every major corporation is extremely exploitative at some point in their supply chain, and almost every single one will lobby for its own interests to the detriment of people around them and our society. Capitalist lobbying is almost entirely to blame for a lack of progress on climate change in the United States, because oil and gas companies will always put profit above our collective good.

								Ahh, at last there's something we agree on!
								
								The thing is, some of this is not exclusive to capitalism; it's human nature. Ruthless and power-hungry people will rise to the top in every system. Capitalism is a meritocracy of sorts because somewhere along the line (with the exception of lottery winners) someone had to have had a good, marketable idea in order to amass a fortune. Communism doesn't operate under those constraints; it's all politics. The only way to get ahead is to ingratiate yourself to Party leaders, and being a good "yes man" doesn't necessarily require competence or ability. (That's one reason why the businesses stolen -- err, I mean *nationalized* -- by Communist governments so often decline and fail. The Party bosses put their cronies in charge, even when they have no expertise in the field. The downfall of Venezuela's oil industry is an example.)

									That's just not true though. Capitalism isn't a meritocracy at all- it's an oligarchy with rampant cronyism and nepotism. The single biggest predictor of your wealth as an adult is how much wealth you were born into. Businesses constantly mess up in ways that should destroy them but are bailed out by the politicians they've bought. And every big company exploits labor to turn larger profits. I'm not saying communism and socialism are perfect, but every single problem you're pointing out is an even bigger problem with capitalism, because capitalism actively incentivizes the worst forms of human behavior. It is inherent to the system. That isn't true within socialism or communism. Bad people will always exist, but socializing ownership allows for their impact to be generally reduced compared to their impact under capitalism.

										> . Capitalism isn't a meritocracy at all- it's an oligarchy with rampant cronyism and nepotism.
										
										This is undoubtedly true to some extent, but a market economy provides a corrective mechanism -- if your company is too corrupt, if you put incompetent people into key positions, it will fail. You'll be overtaken by competitors who are doing a better job of serving customers. Under a communist or socialist system, in which the government operates nationalized enterprises, there is no natural competitor to replace the incompetent. The failing enterprise just lurches along, like Venezuela's state-run oil company. 
										
										>The single biggest predictor of your wealth as an adult is how much wealth you were born into.
										
										Well, there is more to this than meets the eye. For one, intelligence is heritable. Also, culture undoubtedly comes into play. The important question to ask, when it comes to class mobility, isn't "How many people are climbing the ladder?", it's "How many people are even TRYING to climb, and are they meeting with success or failure?" Because in the First World, life among the poor often ain't that bad (I say that having spent my whole life in the working class). This is a rich country; it's possible to live pretty well on the proverbial scraps that fall from the table. I live in rural Appalachia; not everyone wants to go to college and go off to work in the big city. Some of us (myself included) are pretty content to live in a trailer on a little patch of land. We're not really trying to get ahead!
										
										>because capitalism actively incentivizes the worst forms of human behavior. 
										
										See, I'm of the opposite opinion here. I think the driving force in human behavior is perceived self-interest. Most people act in ways they perceive will benefit themselves and their loved ones. Capitalism harnesses that; it gives people with big dreams and desires an opportunity to achieve a superior outcome. The way to beat the system under capitalism is to build the proverbial better mousetrap, to work harder or smarter than the next guy. 
										
										Socialism and communism are kind of the opposite -- they expect people to work for the good of society at large, and promise the same reward regardless of whether you work hard or not. The only way to beat that system is to do less than the next guy for the same reward -- and if enough people do this, pretty soon very little work will be done, which is why these systems usually spiral into hardship and famine. I'm old enough to remember when the Berlin Wall came down. People were amazed by the disparity in the quality of life in East and West Germany.

More depressingly, it pales in comparison to the volume of people that die as a result of capitalism and capitalist exploitation, which conservatively still numbers in the millions each year around the world.

			This is fascinating to me in a way, in the sense that you are a subject being talked about - per "lowly" jobs - but when you rejected how you were positioned in a rhetorical narrative - you got downvoted to zero. (Fixed that.)
			
			I suppose instead of thinking twice and engaging with you and allowing you your own agency, even if it didn't fit in with a given argument, the narrative wouldn't pause and would find the next person whose work conditions were more poorly. 
			
			Edit: that did somewhat happen below, but it's true the regional/legal boundaries of what constitutes "lowly" work arguably do matter a lot because in many countries, 19th century type work conditions are extremely common and jobs involving child labour and high mortality rates, in association with a capitalist system etc. But I am going to assume you're in the US. 
			
			And look, I personally wouldn't agree that "nothing in capitalism prohibits workers from organising and demanding their due", and moreover, for instance, there *are* corrupt union officials. And, unions don't always get what they want, and so on, which isn't to say they don't achieve anything or can't be powerful. But those aren't points I'll try to argue here.
			
			 I think what interests me is the idea that you might qualify for a "lowly" job status but that your view might be disregarded if you have the agency to challenge a politicised narrative about ethics regarding assumptions about someone in your position. 
			
			And you might then be instructed by someone who might actually be considerably more wealthy and privileged than you how you are wrong. 
			
			I do agree with the person who responded before me on the following point, that if we're talking about capitalism as a whole system, then of course we'd need to acknowledge the labour conditions not only in other countries, as well as closer to home. For example, sweatshops and sex trafficking conditions certainly prohibit unionisation for obvious reasons. 
			
			And there are some great docos on working conditions in other countries including those associated with Western businesses which usually outsource labour and production etc.
			
			But in a way, shouldn't your view reach the top? 
			
			I am feeling a bit skeptical, shall we say. Why? I think in this post for this topic, it would only reach the top of you agreed that you were suffering, because that would seem to best fit in with the majority view.
			
			I think your point about alternative systems is valid and important. I suppose people inclined towards socialism or communism might argue that in those systems, although someone will do the "dirty work", their labour/skills will be equally valued and compensated, and not considered lowly but upheld as a pillar of the community or something. So that although the work would be the same work, it would no longer be "dirty"/lowly because it's socioeconomic status would be altered. 
			
			But then just as union corruption is a possibility, you can have corrupt officials, blah blah blah. 
			
			I don't really see this story as being specifically about capitalism, probably, or certainly capitalism alone. 
			
			I think one of the reasons your view will stay at the bottom is that in this discussion, the narrative device of the imprisoned child is what everything hinges upon. People are saying it's a critique of capitalism and therefore the child represents oppressed workers etc. The comment you're responding to refers to "lowliest jobs".
			
			Therefore in a way if you're being aligned with the narrative device of this imprisoned child, it's like the child virtually got up and said "I'm not in prison, and I like it here!" 
			
			That won't do as it ruins the whole thing, including the moral quandary. Hehe. Talk about breaking the fourth wall. 
			
			Yes there really are oppressed people in reality and there's people really more oppressed than a cleaner with good working conditions.
			
			But, I think there's something telling here, in a way you are being used as a cypher and nothing more. So if you challenge the terms of that by putting forward your own subjective experience, in spite of everyone talking *about* who does the "lowliest jobs*, if you speak up for yourself, they're not necessarily going to speak *with* you, especially if it contradicts the overall rhetorical thrust. 
			
			This probably isn't true of everyone, but I personally do think the left (I know it well) is considerably guilty of this tendency. 
			
			I guess there's only one suffering child in Omelas though, so it can't really have its own union 🤔 or can it? 🤨

				You should see how thoroughly I'm downvoted when I comment on the notion of a "living wage"! I'm fond of pointing out that labor shortages are a sure-fire way of increasing wages. I don't need the government to increase the minimum wage; I already make several times over the minimum thanks to the labor shortage in my area. All I really need is for the government to close the borders to the immigrants who would undercut me and drive down the prevailing wage. 
				
				Whenever I say this, I'm roundly downvoted by progressives, former champions of a living wage who turn around and say I'm not worthy of one unless I go tens of thousands of dollars in debt in order to obtain a college degree.

					Edit: sorry this is long, I'll try to whittle it down if I can but I'm too tired just now
					
					I think I understand but even if I didn't and/or my politics are different, definitely, I think that there's a tendency in liberal politics to speak on behalf of a group*without actually genuinely listening* including by engaging only with a small group of cherry picked representatives which no one from the wider group nominated, and to practice selective hearing. 
					
					I think genuine listening is of course a lot more politically complicated. Especially because most groups of people are nowhere near as homogeneous as they first appear. Certainly an ostensibly "progressive" stance can seem less so over time if one realises those speaking are not actually interested one bit in what those they speak about really think and feel, wherever relevant. 
					
					I don't know if our stances are similar on immigration but I'm not sure it matters - in that I can see where you're coming from and I think this is a perfect example of a weak/contentious spot in liberal politics. My guess is that what might frustrate us equally is a refusal to acknowledge that sometimes resources are finite. 
					
					The US is a very rich country compared to others, it doesn't mean that lots of Americans don't live in poverty. Ultimately if everyone comes to America, there's always going to be people who are losing out. If immigration policy isn't sustainable, the "American dream" everyone comes for will cease to exist anyway. 
					
					I do think as human beings if we knew the background of some of the people who seek to come, it would be incredibly difficult to say no, and that's one thing. On the other hand, can the whole world's population move to the US when realistically everyday life is extremely rough in many other places, and there is need?
					
					 Is it more moral to let in people from elsewhere because they have need : when it can directly displace the needs of other groups, who are then forced to compete for limited resources such as accommodation, jobs, subsidies? 
					
					I would think at the least, the latter can be recognised. But I just don't see left or "left-of-centre" politicians advocating for this. I'm not right wing and I only really see immigration policies get criticised alongside certain right wing invective. Which frustrates me personally as there's no moderate approach I happen upon. 
					
					And I would very much include in this legal immigration. It's not always about a skills shortage or improved workforce. Depending on policies it can involve cash grabs by government at the direct expense of certain demographics, where the government also then fails to enact policy that could help safeguard against natives who miss out in competition for limited resources, in the context of influx of an unsustainable quantity of people..
					
					And look, the views of people on this in terms considered socially progressive often do involve blind spots (in my reckoning) concerning what people haven't had to worry about in light of whatever safeguards they may have. 
					
					So there certainly could be an "ivory tower" factor, of sorts. Especially in a region where one requires considerable wealth upfront for tertiary education.  
					
					So yes, I mean going back to the story, in the narrative, in some way, there's no true altruism per se. Because no matter what happens, no one frees the child, even if they move towards what are hoped to be greener pastures. 
					
					In the context of how the story gets interpreted, conversely, the idea of altruism comes to light pretty immediately, nevertheless. 
					
					Walking away from the city may be viewed as a sacrifice even if it doesn't do anything directly to help the child, it nevertheless avoids being part of the system that oppresses it. 
					
					But it's interesting, even as people criticise capitalism, and look, I might be no different, I am a critic, they often seem to labour under certain blind spots. And maybe this can even partially help explain the enduring legacy of capitalism. I don't think we really see any viable alternative systems - no one seems to originate anything these days, we just know how other systems have failed. Arguably the most erstwhile critics of capitalism remain very much part and parcel tucked into a hegemony, expressing doubts and frustrations through safe exercises like this one. 
					
					I could go on, the intentions are good but I can kind of see a divide between upper middle class people talking about workers and the other groups in actuality. They do mean well and at the same time I feel as though the polemic can matter more to some than the actual views of those they make representations about. 
					
					I do feel like the status quo could be that for a critic of capitalism associated with left wing politics, they're gonna talk for groups, and then if you're going to have an American worker versus say an illegal immigrant with competing interests and only one can be advocated for, they'll lean towards the latter, it's like a party line. 
					
					I think conversely that all the circumstances should be taken into account and that you shouldn't undermine the needs of one's own citizens in order to extend an advantage to others - how do I put it - in either case the people advocating one way or the other are most unlikely to be disadvantaged directly no matter what happens. Which can also induce a lack of insight, they're protected. So for the purposes of this story as an allegory they believe they're helping to alleviate the suffering of an oppressed figure, while instead they would simply be swapping them out, more or less. 
					
					I'd like to think le Guin's story can be more ambiguous, more ambivalent even, than only representing a critique of capitalism. 
					
					Some interpretations suggest that the story is written to affirm there can be no optimal society where no one at all is suffering. 
					
					And then, I suppose, the moral quandary becomes if not everyone suffering can be saved, how do you make the decisions about who to protect?
					
					Yet in many cases people making or advocating for such decisions aren't ever going to be in the position where they would be at risk of being the one that suffers. 
					
					So you'd think they could at least listen directly to those whose interests could be affected. 
					
					At least that's my quick and dirty take on it. That's for the situations where this is interpreted as a critique of capitalism or close adjuncts. 
					
					And it's not that they don't mean well, it's just that talking over people's heads is a thing and it's one of the reasons that I don't believe any of the more progressive political ideals can ever truly be realised in many cases because everyone loves the sound of their own voice too much. (And here I am yammering on.) It's impossible. Listening to people would mean diluting the narrative, when the rhetoric is diluted, the invective is ineffective. And so it continues. 
					
					I might try and edit this down but I'm sooo tired and I just found this to be an interesting anomaly in the wider context of the post which provoked a lot of ideas. 
					
					I hope that people learn to listen to you and people like you.

I guess part of my conclusion is that "political correctness" has the potential to be intellectually dishonest as well as suffering myopia and let's throw in a bit of memory loss perhaps..
							
							 I was attempting to plug for a completely different approach which would involve respectful honesty and making immigrants (potential, actual) who want to improve their lives through gaining citizenship aware of tensions around displacement and according them the intelligence to be able to understand this context and have the capacity to discuss it, with the internet enabling such discussion and others. Talked about culture as an adjunct to that..Among other things admitting I somewhat dread globalisation turning places East and West into a generic mishmash of citizens dislocated from the unique traditions and attributes which originally gave them character, among other things. 
							
							Another thought was that acting as though everyone in the world who wants to can move to a country is like having no emotional boundaries. It can't be healthy. I was also saying that if I were to visit or move somewhere, I'd want to know if I could be inadvertently displacing people or annoying the locals. 
							
							There was some other stuff in between, I think I was trying to put a finer point on an experimental rhetoric as to reasons why "politically correct" approaches towards immigration and policy aren't actually that open minded and progressive. And that sort of thing.

	I'd like to make the counterpoint. You say a society with happiness exists and without the suffering of the child. Let's just look at an isolated individual. Is happiness possible without sadness? 

	The answer is no since happiness is a rush of dopamine or serotonin but with more dopamine the baseline changes and we get to a neutral state which is not really happiness. Happiness is a change from baseline and so is sadness. They cannot exist without each other.

	Now in the context of Omelas, I believe it is a story of antinatalism. To be alive is to be complicit in someone's suffering (perhaps one's own but most likely of others depending on how much privilege you got).  Those who walk away may do many things but they explicitly reject this system of barter.

	* 🟨 **[thefuzzyhunter](https://www.reddit.com/user/thefuzzyhunter)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-04-13 16:12:00)_

		You make a good point about how people work, and I think it answers Le Guin's "why do we suck at imagining a society where people don't suffer?" question.  We suck at imagining that society because we suck at not suffering ourselves, and so on some level we are aware that without major suffering on our or anyone else's part, our own life experiences would be so radically different as to be beyond most imaginations.  I grew up fairly privileged in a variety of ways and so most of my own suffering is in some ways a little silly or first-world-problems, but that doesn't stop me from having to deal with shit and be angry or sad or annoyed or whatever.  We make our own suffering.
		
		As for the point about antinatalism-- I see what you're saying, but I don't agree with you (and I don't know if Le Guin would either, but I'm not familiar with her views on the subject in particular).  I think that point (and, perhaps, all of the story's setup) relies on believing that all suffering is bad.  If I were to walk away from Omelas to build a better utopia somewhere, I would probably just decide to go into the woods and build a cabin for myself.  Would I suffer?  Absolutely.  It'd be laborious and time-consuming and I'd probably mess up a lot.  I'd be lonely and tired and hungry a lot of the time.  But it would internalize the suffering (if you view others' suffering as an externality, which is the kind of capitalistic thinking Le Guin would hate), such that all the suffering I put in would be productive, and all the joy I get would be the earned reward of that suffering.  Now, is that scalable?  Can you build a society on this principle?  I think the answer is "maybe," but I certainly can't tell you quite how-- in fact it would probably look a bit like some of Le Guin's other utopias.  But if I were to walk away from Omelas, it would be because I couldn't stand the idea that my joy without suffering depended on someone else's suffering without joy.  The only way I can see to build a more morally gratifying life (at least for myself, and, as the story suggests, the search for a better society is here an individual act, at least at first) is for my suffering to create my joy.

	I've always seen it as a bit of a critique of institutionalized exploitation via things like fossil fuel usage or maybe even animal agriculture albeit in a way that also critiques the titular ones who walk away a bit in my eyes (unless it's implying they did this instead of just running away from a systemic problem like the people who say they'll flee the country if [president they severely don't like] gets elected) as no one ever stops to question okay why are we doing this this way and is there a freaking alternative

	Here I disagree a bit.  I don't think the story at all is saying that there exist other places where people prosper without the suffering of others.  I actually feel like it's sort of important that we, as the reader, can't know for sure whether those who walk away find what they're looking for or don't -- if their success or failure is certain it removes all of the moral quandary.

	> the story also hints very strongly at there being other, better cities

	I completely disagree with this. Omelas is the best place you can imagine with one drawback, a single injustice. The ones who can't come to terms with it and go looking for something better are headed somewhere which "cannot be described" and "may not exist at all." Omelas might be the best we can do—she says this outright.

	The trick to the story, in my opinion, is that it isn't about Omelas. It's about *the ones who walk away* from Omelas. Omelas is nearly perfect, and a better society is (as the author says) practically unimaginable. At the same time, we're very good at deciding as a society that "we can't do any better than this." The ones who walk away from Omelas are the skeptics who, regardless of whether it's true or not, insist on believing that we can do better, and sacrifice everything to try.

	Crucially, you don't have the option to pick the best possible city. The choice is this: You can settle for a very good city and try to be happy despite the injustice, or you can keep trying to fight injustice even past the point where it may be impossible. Neither of those are ideal, and I don't think Le Guin is telling us which one we should pick. But the story celebrates the people who walk away, even if they're ultimately doomed to never be satisfied. I think that's a much more complicated and interesting message than "a perfect utopia is possible &amp; we should try to make it happen no matter what," which is kind of silly and superficial IMO.

	I have heard a totally different take, but instead the main point is to question the line between utopia and dystopia, especially in the original definition of dystopias as "bad utopia's" - ie worlds that were presented as perfect/deliberately designed, but to some of the citizens and especially to the reader, actually sounded pretty bad. Omelas is initially presented as a utopia, but then we learn its secret, and it becomes a question about whether it really is a utopia, or a dystopia, or both to different people. I believe the story is inspired by some writings about utopianism and scapegoats which posed a similar question.

		>and it becomes a question about whether it really is a utopia, or a dystopia, or both to different people
		
		Le Guin wasn't exactly going for subtlety with the "This society's happiness depends on the suffering of a child" premise. There's no question being asked there, she's telling you it's dystopic, and that this is basically the system we currently live in. Any world that lives by this system cannot be a utopia.
		
		Le Guin was nothing if not an optimist. *Omelas* is effectively her quote "We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings." put to a story; the idea that this system *isn't* necessary, that even though it's all we know and it encapsulates *everything*, we can still leave. There's never any actual rationale given for the child's suffering; in all likelihood they merely do this because they fear what might happen if they don't. The same is true for our world.

			You're taking a "if it was real" view, but I'm talking about it as literary criticism of utopia/dystopia as literary devices. It was only in the 1990s that "dystopia" came to be just any bad world. Prior to that it was used to describe worlds designed as utopias that don't really sound great. She didn't come up with the premise. It comes from The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoyevsky, but she claims she was specifically inspired about it in the essay I mentioned by William James.

	I think you can read a critique of utilitarianism into the story. Everyone who stays in Omelas believes it is a net positive to let one person be endlessly tortured in order that many may lead joyful lives. Those who walk away, don't. 

	Utilitarianism reduces morality down to a simple balancing equation - if there's more net joy in the world than net suffering, you have a just world. Those who disagree have the sense that suffering anywhere is a moral insult, and cannot be erased by joy. This seems to me to be in line with Buddhist thought, which calls its adherents not to increase joy in the world, but to specifically reduce suffering, both in themselves by reducing their attachment to desire, and in others by actively alleviating their suffering.

	So it is really pitting two moral systems against each other - is morality about the greatest good for the greatest number? Or is it about rooting out suffering anywhere?

		This is an interesting take, but what about the fact that walking away does nothing to reduce the child's suffering, even if those who do not stay also no longer partake in the cause of it?

		* 🟧 **[trebletones](https://www.reddit.com/user/trebletones)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-15 20:03:22)_

			That is true. Maybe I'm reading too much into it. Alleviating the child's suffering would be the best choice, but trying that doesn't seem to really do much in this universe either. But I think there is still some moral value in refusing to participate in the perpetuation of suffering. 
			
			Off topic - it's never made clear in the story how the torture is inflicted on the child. Does it happen magically, without any input from the citizens of Omelas? I think if the torture is inflicted in some divine, unknowable way, without the citizens really choosing that torture, that hits different than if the citizens have to actively, physically torture the child in order to ensure their happiness.

			* 🟦 **[Wide_Literature6114](https://www.reddit.com/user/Wide_Literature6114)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-04-16 06:38:20)_

				Off topic analysis is interesting! Great point. 
				
				I can't decide whether walking away is actually selfish, out of sight, out of mind, or like a boycott which is of the greater good owing to personal sacrifice even if actually rescuing the child seems to be out of scope. I honestly can't remember if the first time I read it I was a bit bummed or aghast that they walked away, only, because the child is still captive after all! 
				
				It feels like the torture is abstract, right? But who knows, maybe they line up in a row :/ 
				
				I'm gonna say it's more magical 🤔 the alternative seems as though it breaks a rule of the mythos, it's too direct and brutish; the child suffers but the cause of its suffering remains on some level an abstraction so that it's not brought into the realm of something more associated with the everyday world. I can't find the right word because each time it sounds like being flip about torture of a child or referring to a more sophisticated framework for this which just sounds wrong. 
				
				This being said, I think they'll take the artful approach towards its suffering on some level, it won't be too coarse or provincial, magic would enable such an effect, if that makes sense without sounding too awful.

	Your analysis is suspiciously similar to one posted by the YouTuber Big Joel on his "Little Joel" channel a few weeks ago: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5op696mKyY]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5op696mKyY)

		While I was making my post I started to feel stupid that I was pointing out something relatively obvious that I hadn't seen anyone else bring up about this short story, so I looked for other analysis, and I did find that video. (I felt very vindicated). But I already had pretty much all the same points we have in common written down. As he says in his video: "Many people have said this before me." I only reused small points or phrasings from his video, the rest I had already wrote.
		
		But the second big point of my post is about how this story is meant to be connected to the real world, which I don't think he touches on in his video. It's the reason I made the post in the first place, here's a comment I made in another thread before I started making the post and before I watched the video:

	it’s about capitalism. capitalists believe some of us must suffer so that others may have happiness. they don’t believe a society can provide for everyone if it wanted to.

		I think it's more accurate to say that we don't believe a society *should* provide for everyone ... rather, it is the job of able-bodied people of normal abilities to provide for themselves and their children.

			a good point, but i think the reality is a little of this, *and* a little of that. the quote, “the problem with socialism is, eventually you run out of other people’s money,” comes to mind. they think both that it’s not possible, and that they shouldn’t have to, or at least they pretend to believe the former.

	The ones who walk away are refusing to partake in the joys brought about by the suffering child. They will not build the same society without the suffering child, it is not possible. Instead, they will all suffer their fair amount and will all enjoy their fair amount. Noone will have what they haven't earned.

	I see the story as a parable that explores the idea that the good is the enemy of the great.

	I agree with your interpretation.

	The banality of evil theory has been debunked, btw. I'm not going to hate on Le Guin for that. It was very popular in its time

	I would intentionally speak kindly to the child (even though it wouldn't really make the child's life measurably better) just to destroy Omelas.
