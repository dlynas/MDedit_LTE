**Creative Commons** (**CC**) is an American [non-profit organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization "Non-profit organization") and international network devoted to educational access and expanding the range of [creative works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_works "Creative works") available for others to build upon legally and to share.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> The organization has released several [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright") [licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License "License"), known as [Creative Commons licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license "Creative Commons license"), free of charge to the public. These licenses allow authors of creative works to communicate which rights they reserve and which rights they [waive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waive "Waive") for the benefit of recipients or other creators. An easy-to-understand one-page explanation of rights, with associated visual symbols, explains the specifics of each Creative Commons license. Content owners still maintain their copyright, but Creative Commons licenses give standard releases that replace the individual negotiations for specific rights between copyright owner (licensor) and [licensee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensee "Licensee"), that are necessary under an "[all rights reserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved "All rights reserved")" copyright management.

The organization was founded in 2001 by [Lawrence Lessig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig "Lawrence Lessig"), [Hal Abelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Abelson "Hal Abelson"), and [Eric Eldred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Eldred "Eric Eldred")<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> with the support of [Center for the Public Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_the_Public_Domain "Center for the Public Domain"). The first article in a general interest publication about Creative Commons, written by [Hal Plotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Plotkin "Hal Plotkin"), was published in February 2002.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> The first set of copyright licenses was released in December 2002.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> The founding management team that developed the licenses and built the Creative Commons infrastructure as it is known today included [Molly Shaffer Van Houweling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Shaffer_Van_Houweling "Molly Shaffer Van Houweling"), Glenn Otis Brown, Neeru Paharia, and Ben Adida.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

In 2002, Creative Commons was selected as the successor of the Open Content Project, a 1998 precursor project by [David A. Wiley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Wiley "David A. Wiley"). Wiley subsequently joined Creative Commons as its director.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> The licenses published by the Open Content Project, the [Open Content License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Content_License "Open Content License") and [Open Publication License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Publication_License "Open Publication License"), were soon deprecated in favour of Creative Commons licenses.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz "Aaron Swartz") played a role in the early stages of Creative Commons,<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> as did [Matthew Haughey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Haughey "Matthew Haughey").<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

_Made with Creative Commons_, a 2017 book describing the value of CC licenses.

Creative Commons has been an early participant in the [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft "Copyleft") movement, which seeks to provide alternative solutions to [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright"), and has been dubbed "some rights reserved".<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Creative Commons has been credited with contributing to a re-thinking of the role of the "[commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons "Commons")" in the "[information age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_age "Information age")". Their frameworks help individuals and groups distribute content more freely while still protecting themselves and their [intellectual property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property "Intellectual property") rights legally.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

According to its founder [Lawrence Lessig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig "Lawrence Lessig"), Creative Commons' goal is to counter the dominant and increasingly restrictive [permission culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permission_culture "Permission culture") that limits artistic creation to existing or powerful creators.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Lessig maintains that modern culture is dominated by traditional content distributors in order to maintain and strengthen their monopolies on cultural products such as popular music and popular cinema, and that Creative Commons can provide alternatives to these restrictions.<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

In mid‑December 2020, Creative Commons released its strategy for the upcoming five years, which will focus more on three core of goals including advocacy, infrastructure innovation, and capacity building.<sup id="cite_ref-creative-commons-2020_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-creative-commons-2020-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-stihler-2020_24-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-stihler-2020-24">[24]</a></sup>

## Creative Commons network\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creative_Commons&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Creative Commons network")\]

Until April 2018, Creative Commons had over 100 affiliates working in over 75 jurisdictions to support and promote CC activities around the world.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> In 2018 this affiliate network has been restructured into a network organisation.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> The network no longer relies on affiliate organisation but on individual membership organised in Chapter.

### Hungary\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creative_Commons&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Hungary")\]

[Creative Commons Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_Hungary "Creative Commons Hungary") was the affiliated network of Creative Commons in Hungary. The non-profit organization was founded in Budapest, Hungary in 2008 and was deleted from the official registry on 6 February 2017.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

### Japan\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creative_Commons&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Japan")\]

**Creative Commons Japan (CC Japan/CCJP)** is the affiliated network of Creative Commons in Japan.

In 2003, the International University GLOCOM held a meeting for the CC Japan preparation.

In March 2004, CC Japan was launched by GLOCOM University. CC Japan is the world's second CC affiliated network (the first is in America).

In March 2006, CC Japan become the NPO and be in motion. In the same month, the CC founder [Lawrence Lessig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig "Lawrence Lessig") came to Japan to be one of the main holders of the open ceremony. Within the same year, between May and June, different international events were held in Japan, including iSummit 06 and the first through third rounds of CCJP.

In February 2007, the ICC x ClipLife 15 second CM competition was held. In June, iSummit 07 was held. In July, the fourth CCJP was held. On July 25, Tokyo approved Nobuhiro Nakayama (中山信弘) to become the NGO chairman of CCJP.

In 2008, Taipie ACIA joined CCJP. The main theme music which was chosen by CCJP was announced.

In 2009, INTO INFINITY shown in [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo") and [Sapporo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapporo "Sapporo"). iPhone held the shows with Audio Visual Mixer for INTO INFINITY. ([Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.") joint research and development with CCJP)

In 2012, the 10th anniversary ceremony was held in Japan.

In 2015, Creative Commons 4.0 and Creative Commons 0 were released in Japanese language.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

### South Korea\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creative_Commons&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: South Korea")\]

**Creative Commons Korea** (**CC Korea**) is the affiliated network of Creative Commons in South Korea. In March 2005, CC Korea was initiated by Jongsoo Yoon (in [Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"): 윤종수), former Presiding Judge of Incheon District Court, as a project of Korea Association for Infomedia Law (KAFIL). The major Korean portal sites, including Daum and Naver, have been participating in the use of Creative Commons licences. In January 2009, the Creative Commons Korea Association was consequently founded as a non-profit incorporated association. Since then, CC Korea has been actively promoting the liberal and open culture of creation as well as leading the diffusion of Creative Common in the country.

### Bassel Khartabil\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creative_Commons&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Bassel Khartabil")\]

[Bassel Khartabil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassel_Khartabil "Bassel Khartabil") was a Palestinian Syrian [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software") developer who served as a project lead and public affiliate for Creative Commons Syria.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> On March 15, 2012, he was detained by the Syrian government in [Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus") at [Adra Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adra_Prison "Adra Prison") for no crime. On October 17, 2015, the Creative Commons Board of Directors passed a resolution calling for Bassel Khartabil's release.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> In 2017, Bassel's wife received confirmation that Bassel had been killed shortly after she lost contact with him in 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>

## Evolution of CC licenses\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creative_Commons&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Evolution of CC licenses")\]

All current CC licenses (except the CC0 Public Domain Dedication tool) require attribution (attributing the authors of the original creative works), which can be inconvenient for works based on multiple other works.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> Critics feared that Creative Commons could erode the copyright system over time,<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> or allow "some of our most precious resources – the creativity of individuals – to be simply tossed into the commons to be exploited by whomever has spare time and a magic marker."<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

Critics also worried that the lack of rewards for content producers would dissuade artists from publishing their work, and questioned whether Creative Commons would enable the [commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons "Commons") that it aimed to create.<sup id="cite_ref-Niva_Elkin-Koren_37-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-Niva_Elkin-Koren-37">[37]</a></sup>

Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig countered that copyright laws have not always offered the strong and seemingly indefinite protection that today's law provides. Rather, the duration of copyright used to be limited to much shorter terms of years, and some works never gained protection because they did not follow the now-abandoned compulsory format.<sup id="cite_ref-Lawrence_Lessig,_The_Creative_Commons_38-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-Lawrence_Lessig,_The_Creative_Commons-38">[38]</a></sup>

The maintainers of [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian "Debian"), a [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution "Linux distribution") known for its strict adherence to a particular definition of [software freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_freedom "Software freedom"),<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> rejected the Creative Commons Attribution License prior to version 3 as incompatible with the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines "Debian Free Software Guidelines") (DFSG) due to the license's anti-[DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management "Digital rights management") provisions (which might, due to ambiguity, be covering more than DRM) and its requirement that downstream users remove an author's credit upon request from the author.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> Version 3.0 of the Creative Commons licenses addressed these concerns and,<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> except for the non commercial and no-derivative variants, are considered to be compatible with the DFSG.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

Kent Anderson, writing for [The Scholarly Kitchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scholarly_Kitchen "The Scholarly Kitchen"), a blog of the [Society for Scholarly Publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Scholarly_Publishing "Society for Scholarly Publishing"), criticized CC as being grounded on copyright principles and not really departing from it, and as being more complex and complicating than the latter – thus the public does not scrutinize CC, reflexively accepting it as one would a [software license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EULA "EULA") – while at the same time weakening the rights provided by copyright. Anderson ends up concluding that this is the point, and that "Creative Commons receives significant funding from large information companies like [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google"), [Nature Publishing Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Publishing_Group "Nature Publishing Group"), and [RedHat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RedHat "RedHat")", and that Google money is especially linked to CC's history; for him, CC is "an organization designed to promulgate the interests of technology companies and Silicon Valley generally".<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>

### CC license proliferation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creative_Commons&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: CC license proliferation")\]

According to [Mako Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mako_Hill "Mako Hill"), Creative Commons has established a range of licenses tailored to meet the different protection interests of authors of creative works, rather than forcing a single forced standard as a "base level of freedom" that all Creative Commons licenses must meet, and with which all licensors and users must comply. "By failing to take any firm ethical position and draw any line in the sand, CC is a missed opportunity. ...CC has replaced what could have been a call for a world where 'essential rights are unreservable' with the relatively hollow call for 'some rights reserved.'" He also argued that Creative Commons enables [license proliferation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_proliferation "License proliferation"), by providing multiple licenses that are [incompatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility "License compatibility").<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>

The Creative Commons website states, "Since each of the six CC licenses functions differently, resources placed under different licenses may not necessarily be combined with one another without violating the license terms."<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> Works licensed under incompatible licenses may not be recombined in a [derivative work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work "Derivative work") without obtaining permission from the copyright owner.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>

[Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman "Richard Stallman") of the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation "Free Software Foundation") stated in 2005 that he could not support Creative Commons as an activity because "it adopted some additional licenses which do not give everyone that minimum freedom", that freedom being "the freedom to share, noncommercially, any published work".<sup id="cite_ref-49"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> Those licenses have since been retired by Creative Commons.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>

Creative Commons is only a service provider for standardized license text, not a party in any agreement. No central database of Creative Commons works is controlling all licensed works and the responsibility of the Creative Commons system rests entirely with those using the licences.<sup id="cite_ref-51"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-52"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> This situation is, however, not specific to Creative Commons. All copyright owners must individually defend their rights and no central database of copyrighted works or existing license agreements exists. The [United States Copyright Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Copyright_Office "United States Copyright Office") does keep a database of all works registered with it, but absence of registration does not imply absence of copyright, and CC licensed works can be registered on the same terms as unlicensed works or works licensed under any other licences.

Although Creative Commons offers multiple licenses for different uses, some critics suggested that the licenses still do not address the differences among the media or among the various concerns that different authors have.<sup id="cite_ref-Niva_Elkin-Koren_37-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-Niva_Elkin-Koren-37">[37]</a></sup>

Lessig wrote that the point of Creative Commons is to provide a middle ground between two extreme views of copyright protection – one demanding that all rights be controlled, and the other arguing that none should be controlled. Creative Commons provides a third option that allows authors to pick and choose which rights they want to control and which they want to grant to others. The multitude of licenses reflects the multitude of rights that can be passed on to subsequent creators.<sup id="cite_ref-Lawrence_Lessig,_The_Creative_Commons_38-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-Lawrence_Lessig,_The_Creative_Commons-38">[38]</a></sup>

### Non-commercial use licenses\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creative_Commons&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Non-commercial use licenses")\]

"Defining 'Noncommercial'", a 2009 report from Creative Commons on the concept of noncommercial media

Various commentators have reported confusion in understanding what "noncommercial" use means. Creative Commons issued a report in 2009, "Defining noncommercial", which presented research and various perspectives. The report claimed that noncommercial to many people means "no exchange of money or any commerce". Beyond that simple statement, many people disagree on whether noncommercial use permits publishing on websites supported with advertising, sharing noncommercial media through nonprofit publishing for a fee, and many other practices in contemporary media distribution. Creative Commons has not sought to resolve the confusion, in part because of high consumer demand for the noncommercial license as is with its ambiguity.<sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-55"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>

### Personality rights\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Creative_Commons&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Personality rights")\]

In 2007, [Virgin Mobile Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Mobile_Australia "Virgin Mobile Australia") launched a bus stop advertising campaign which promoted its mobile phone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to the photo-sharing site [Flickr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr "Flickr") using a [Creative Commons by Attribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_Attribution_2.5 "Creative Commons Attribution 2.5") license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation being required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL, leading to the photographer's Flickr page, on each of their ads. However, one picture depicted 15-year-old Alison Chang posing for a photo at her church's fund-raising carwash, with the superimposed, mocking slogan "Dump Your Pen Friend".<sup id="cite_ref-56"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-permission_57-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-permission-57">[57]</a></sup> Chang sued Virgin Mobile and Creative Commons. The photo was taken by Chang's church youth counsellor, Justin Ho-Wee Wong, who uploaded the image to Flickr under the Creative Commons license.<sup id="cite_ref-permission_57-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-permission-57">[57]</a></sup>

> The case hinges on privacy, the right of people not to have their likeness used in an ad without permission. So, while Mr. Wong may have given away his rights as a photographer, he did not, and could not, give away Alison's [rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights "Personality rights"). In the lawsuit, which Mr. Wong is also a party to, there is an argument that Virgin did not honor all the terms of the nonrestrictive license.<sup id="cite_ref-permission_57-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-permission-57">[57]</a></sup>

On November 27, 2007, Chang voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit against Creative Commons, focusing the lawsuit only against Virgin Mobile.<sup id="cite_ref-58"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> The case was thrown out of court due to lack of jurisdiction and subsequently Virgin Mobile did not incur any damages towards the plaintiff.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>
