The **Sykes–Picot Agreement** (<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>) was a 1916 [secret treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_treaty "Secret treaty") between the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland") and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Third_Republic "French Third Republic"), with assent from the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire") and the [Kingdom of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy "Kingdom of Italy"), to define their mutually agreed [spheres of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence "Sphere of influence") and control in an eventual [partition of the Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "Partition of the Ottoman Empire").

The agreement was based on the premise that the [Triple Entente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Entente "Triple Entente") would achieve success in defeating the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and formed part of a series of secret agreements contemplating its partition. The primary negotiations leading to the agreement took place between 23 November 1915 and 3 January 1916, on which date the British and French diplomats, [Mark Sykes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sykes "Mark Sykes") and [François Georges-Picot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Georges-Picot "François Georges-Picot"), initialled an agreed memorandum.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> The agreement was ratified by their respective governments on 9 and 16 May 1916.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

The agreement effectively divided the Ottoman provinces outside the [Arabian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula "Arabian Peninsula") into areas of British and French control and influence. The British- and French-controlled countries were divided by the Sykes–Picot line.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The agreement allocated to the UK control of what is today [southern Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Israel "Southern Israel") and [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine "State of Palestine"), [Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan "Jordan") and southern [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq "Iraq"), and an additional small area that included the ports of [Haifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa "Haifa") and [Acre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre,_Israel "Acre, Israel") to allow access to the Mediterranean.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Original_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Original-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Mikaberidze2011_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Mikaberidze2011-8">[8]</a></sup> France was to control southeastern [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey "Turkey"), the [Kurdistan Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Region "Kurdistan Region"), [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria "Syria") and [Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon "Lebanon").<sup id="cite_ref-Mikaberidze2011_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Mikaberidze2011-8">[8]</a></sup>

As a result of the included [Sazonov–Paléologue Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sazonov%E2%80%93Pal%C3%A9ologue_Agreement "Sazonov–Paléologue Agreement"), Russia was to get [Western Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Armenia "Western Armenia") in addition to [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople "Constantinople") and the [Turkish Straits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Straits "Turkish Straits") already promised under the 1915 [Constantinople Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople_Agreement "Constantinople Agreement").<sup id="cite_ref-Mikaberidze2011_8-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Mikaberidze2011-8">[8]</a></sup> Italy assented to the agreement in 1917 via the [Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_of_Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne "Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne") and received southern [Anatolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia "Anatolia").<sup id="cite_ref-Mikaberidze2011_8-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Mikaberidze2011-8">[8]</a></sup> The [Palestine region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)"), with a smaller area than the later [Mandatory Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine "Mandatory Palestine"), was to fall under an "international administration".

The agreement was initially used directly as the basis for the [1918 Anglo–French Modus Vivendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_Anglo%E2%80%93French_Modus_Vivendi "1918 Anglo–French Modus Vivendi"), which provided a framework for the [Occupied Enemy Territory Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_Enemy_Territory_Administration "Occupied Enemy Territory Administration") in the Levant. More broadly it was to lead, indirectly, to the subsequent partitioning of the Ottoman Empire following Ottoman defeat in 1918. Shortly after the war, [the French ceded Palestine and Mosul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_Clemenceau%E2%80%93Lloyd_George_Agreement_(Middle_East) "1918 Clemenceau–Lloyd George Agreement (Middle East)") to the British. Mandates in the Levant and Mesopotamia were assigned at the April 1920 [San Remo conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Remo_conference "San Remo conference") following the Sykes–Picot framework; the British [Mandate for Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Palestine "Mandate for Palestine") ran until 1948, the British [Mandate for Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Mesopotamia "Mandate for Mesopotamia") was to be [replaced by a similar treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Iraqi_Treaty_of_1922 "Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922") with [Mandatory Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Iraq "Mandatory Iraq"), and the French [Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Syria_and_the_Lebanon "Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon") lasted until 1946. The Anatolian parts of the agreement were assigned by the August 1920 [Treaty of Sèvres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_S%C3%A8vres "Treaty of Sèvres"); however, these ambitions were thwarted by the 1919–23 [Turkish War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_War_of_Independence "Turkish War of Independence") and the subsequent [Treaty of Lausanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne "Treaty of Lausanne").

The agreement is seen by many as a turning point in [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world") and [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world "Arab world") relations. It reneged upon the [UK's promises to Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence "McMahon–Hussein Correspondence")<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> regarding a national Arab homeland in the area of [Greater Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Syria "Greater Syria") in exchange for supporting the British against the Ottoman Empire. The agreement, along with others, was made public by the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks "Bolsheviks")<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> in Moscow on 23 November 1917 and repeated in _[The Manchester Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manchester_Guardian "The Manchester Guardian")_ on 26 November 1917, such that "the British were embarrassed, the Arabs dismayed and the Turks delighted".<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> The agreement's legacy has led to much resentment in the region, among Arabs in particular but also among [Kurds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds "Kurds") who were denied an [independent state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_independence "Kurdish independence").<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

In the Constantinople Agreement of 18 March 1915, following the start of [naval operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_operations_in_the_Dardanelles_campaign "Naval operations in the Dardanelles campaign") in the run up to the [Gallipoli campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_campaign "Gallipoli campaign") the Russian Foreign Minister, [Sergey Sazonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Sazonov "Sergey Sazonov"), wrote to the French and UK ambassadors and staked a claim to [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople "Constantinople") and the [Dardanelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dardanelles "Dardanelles"). In a series of diplomatic exchanges over five weeks, the UK and France both agreed, while putting forward their own claims, to an increased sphere of influence in Iran in the case of the UK and to an annexation of [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_(region) "Syria (region)") (including [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)")) and [Cilicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilicia "Cilicia") for France. The UK and French claims were both agreed, all sides also agreeing that the exact governance of the [Holy Places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Places "Holy Places") was to be left for later settlement.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHurewitz197916–21_18-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHurewitz197916%E2%80%9321-18">[18]</a></sup> Were it not for the [Russian Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolutions "Russian Revolutions") of 1917, Constantinople and the Straits could have been given to Russia upon the Allied victory. This agreement and the Sykes–Picot Agreement were complementary, as France and Britain first had to satisfy Russia in order to finalize the partitioning of the Middle East.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

In the Treaty of London of 26 April 1915, Article 9 included commitments regarding Italian participation in any partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The article stated: "If France, Great Britain and Russia occupy any territories in Turkey in Asia during the course of the war, the Mediterranean region bordering on the Province of [Adalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antalya "Antalya") within the limits indicated above shall be reserved to Italy, who shall be entitled to occupy it."

The area of Arab independence was defined to be "bounded on the North by [Mersina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersin "Mersin") and [Adana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adana "Adana") up to [37 degrees of latitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/37th_parallel_north "37th parallel north"), on which degree fall [Birijik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birecik "Birecik"), [Urfa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urfa "Urfa"), [Mardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardin "Mardin"), [Midiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midyat "Midyat"), [Jerizat (Ibn ʿUma)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cizre "Cizre"), [Amadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadia "Amadia"), up to the border of Persia; on the east by the borders of Persia up to the [Gulf of Basra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Basra "Gulf of Basra"); on the South by the [Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean "Indian Ocean"), with the exception of the position of [Aden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden "Aden") to remain as it is; on the west by the [Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea "Red Sea"), the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea") up to [Mersina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersin "Mersin")", with the exception of "portions of [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_(region) "Syria (region)")" lying to the west of "the districts of [Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus "Damascus"), [Homs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs "Homs"), [Hama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hama "Hama") and [Aleppo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleppo "Aleppo")".

Hussein's reply of 1 January to McMahon's 14 December 1915 was received at the Foreign Office, McMahon's cover stating:

> Satisfactory as it may be to note his general acceptance for the time being of the proposed relations of France with Arabia, his reference to the future of those relations adumbrates a source of trouble which it will be wise not to ignore. I have on more than one occasion brought to the notice of His Majesty's Government the deep antipathy with which the Arabs regard the prospect of French Administration of any portion of Arab territory. In this lies considerable danger to our future relations with France, because difficult and even impossible though it may be to convince France of her mistake, if we do not endeavour to do so by warning her of the real state of Arab feeling, we may hereafter be accused of instigating or encouraging the opposition to the French, which the Arabs now threaten and will assuredly give.

After discussions, Grey instructed that the French be informed of the situation, although [Paul Cambon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cambon "Paul Cambon") did not take the agreement that seriously.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016103–104_23-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016103%E2%80%93104-23">[23]</a></sup>

Minutes of the first negotiation on 23 November 1915, in which both sides set out their starting positions

Picot proposed that the French area include: "the whole of [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria_(region) "Syria (region)") and [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)"), and that their southern boundary must be the present [Egypto-Turkish frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borders_of_Israel#Border_with_Egypt "Borders of Israel")," that the boundary line would then go to "[Deir ez-Zor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_ez-Zor "Deir ez-Zor") and from there Eastwards to the south of [Kirkuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkuk "Kirkuk"), turning east of that place and running north to include the whole of the [Mosul district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosul_Vilayet "Mosul Vilayet"); thence West to include [Diyarbekir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyarbekir_Vilayet "Diyarbekir Vilayet"), and on to include the [whole of Cilicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adana_Vilayet "Adana Vilayet")."

The British had proposed as an eastern boundary: "the line of the [Euphrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphrates "Euphrates") as far south as Deir ez-Zor and thence in south-westerly direction." With respect to Palestine, the British noted that "[Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem"), [Nazareth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazareth "Nazareth") and other places was a question apart, and affected various other nations including Russia: and that this question could not now be gone into."

On 21 October 1915, Grey met Cambon and suggested France appoint a representative to discuss the future borders of Syria as Britain wished to back the creation of an independent Arab state. At this point Grey was faced with competing claims from the French and from Hussein and the day before had sent a telegram to Cairo telling the High Commissioner to be as vague as possible in his next letter to the Sharif when discussing the northwestern, Syrian, corner of the territory Hussein claimed and left McMahon with "discretion in the matter as it is urgent and there is not time to discuss an exact formula", adding, "If something more precise than this is required you can give it."<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

> "The main problem to be solved is to discover a middle course which will harmonise with the requirements of the various parties, which are as follows:  
> (a) France requires a settlement which (1) while compensating her for the inconvenience and loss attendant upon the disruption of the Ottoman Empire, will (2) safeguard her historic and traditional position in Syria, (3) assure her of full opportunity of realising her economic aspirations in the Near East.  
> (b) The Arabs require (1) recognition of their nationality, (2) protection of their race from alien oppression, and (3) an opportunity of re-establishing their position as a contributing factor in the world's progress.  
> (c) Great Britain requires (1) to assure her position in the Persian Gulf, (2) opportunity to develop Lower Mesopotamia, (3) (a) commercial and military communication between the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean by land, (b) influence in an area sufficient to provide the personnel engaged in Mesopotamia irrigation work with suitable sanatoria, and hill stations, and containing an adequate native recruiting ground for administrative purposes, (4) to obtain commercial facilities in the area under discussion.  
> (d) Lastly, such a settlement has to be worked in with an arrangement satisfactory to the conscientious desires of Christianity, Judaeism, and Mohammedanism in regard to the status of Jerusalem and the neighboring shrines."

The first meeting of the British interdepartmental committee headed by Sir [Arthur Nicolson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Nicolson,_1st_Baron_Carnock "Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock") with François Georges-Picot took place on 23 November 1915. Picot informed the Nicolson committee that France claimed the possession of land starting from where the [Taurus Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_Mountains "Taurus Mountains") approach the sea in [Cilicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilicia "Cilicia"), following the Taurus Mountains and the mountains further East, so as to include [Diyarbekir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyarbekir "Diyarbekir"), [Mosul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosul "Mosul") and [Erbil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbil "Erbil"), and then returning to [Deir ez-Zor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_ez-Zor "Deir ez-Zor") on the Euphrates and from there southwards along the desert border, finishing eventually at the Egyptian frontier. Picot, however, added that he was prepared "to propose to the French government to throw Mosul into the Arab pool, if we did so in the case of Baghdad".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout201684_26-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout201684-26">[26]</a></sup>

A second meeting of the Nicolson committee with Picot took place on 21 December 1915 wherein Picot said that he had obtained permission to agree to the towns of Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damascus being included in the Arab dominions to be administered by the Arabs. Although the French had scaled back their demands to some extent, the British also claimed to want to include Lebanon in the future Arab State and this meeting also ended at an impasse.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout201694_27-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout201694-27">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>

On 17 December, Sykes set out his objectives for the negotiation in an interview with the British War Committee. He stated his desire for British control over [Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)") ("such country south of [Haifa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa "Haifa")"), creating "a belt of English-controlled country" south of "a line from the 'e' in [Acre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre,_Israel "Acre, Israel") to the last 'k' in [Kirkuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkuk "Kirkuk")".

On Tuesday 28 December, Mark Sykes informed [Gilbert Clayton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Clayton "Gilbert Clayton") that he had "been given the Picot negotiations". Sykes and Picot entered into "almost daily" private discussions over the six-day period; no documents survive from these discussions.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBerdine201878–80_29-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBerdine201878%E2%80%9380-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFriedman1992106_30-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFriedman1992106-30">[30]</a></sup>

On Monday 3 January 1916, they agreed and initialled a joint memorandum containing what was to become known as the Sykes–Picot Agreement. They had agreed to compromise on the two primary areas of difference—they split the [Mosul Vilayet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosul_Vilayet "Mosul Vilayet") in two at the [Little Zab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Zab "Little Zab") river, with the French taking the northern part ([Mosul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosul "Mosul") and [Erbil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbil "Erbil")) and the British taking the southern part ([Kirkuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkuk "Kirkuk") and [Sulaymaniyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulaymaniyah "Sulaymaniyah")), and Palestine was to be placed under an "international administration, the form of which is to be decided upon after consultation with Russia, and subsequently in consultation with the other allies, and the representatives of the sheriff of Mecca."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBerdine201877–79_31-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBerdine201877%E2%80%9379-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-SPmemo_25-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-SPmemo-25">[25]</a></sup>

The memorandum was forwarded to the Foreign Office and circulated for comments.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-33">[a]</a></sup> On 16 January, Sykes told the Foreign office that he had spoken to Picot and that he thought Paris would be able to agree. An interdepartmental conference was convened by Nicolson on 21 January. Following the meeting, a final draft agreement was circulated to the cabinet on 2 February, the War Committee considered it on the 3rd and finally at a meeting on the 4th between Bonar Law, Chamberlain, Lord Kitchener and others it was decided that:

> M. Picot may inform his government that the acceptance of the whole project would entail the abdication of considerable British interests, but provided that the cooperation of the Arabs is secured, and that the Arabs fulfil the conditions and obtain the towns of Homs, Hama, Damascus and Aleppo, the British Government would not object to the arrangement. But, as the Blue Area extends so far Eastwards, and affects Russian interests, it would be absolutely essential that, before anything was concluded, the consent of Russia was obtained.

Picot was informed and five days later Cambon told Nicolson that "the French government were in accord with the proposals concerning the Arab question".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016100–102_34-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016100%E2%80%93102-34">[33]</a></sup>

Later, in February and March, Sykes and Picot acted as advisors to Sir George Buchanan and the French ambassador respectively, during negotiations with Sazonov.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout201684_26-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout201684-26">[26]</a></sup>

Eventually, Russia having agreed on 26 April 1916, the final terms were sent by Paul Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Edward Grey, on 9 May 1916, and ratified in Grey's reply on 16 May 1916.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-35">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-36">[35]</a></sup>

In a meeting in a railway car at [Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne "Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne") on 19 April 1917, a tentative agreement was reached between British and French Prime Ministers, [David Lloyd George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_George "David Lloyd George") and [Alexandre Ribot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Ribot "Alexandre Ribot"), and the Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, [Paolo Boselli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Boselli "Paolo Boselli") and [Sidney Sonnino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Sonnino "Sidney Sonnino"); to settle the Italian interest in the Ottoman Empire—specifically article 9 of the Treaty of London.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEHurewitz197994_40-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHurewitz197994-40">[38]</a></sup> The agreement was needed by the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I "Allies of World War I") to secure the position of Italian forces in West Asia.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-41">[39]</a></sup>

The goal was to balance the military power drops at the [Middle Eastern theatre of World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern_theatre_of_World_War_I "Middle Eastern theatre of World War I") as Russian (Tsarist) forces were pulling out of the [Caucasus campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus_campaign "Caucasus campaign"), even though they were replaced with the forces of what would be called the [First Republic of Armenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Republic_of_Armenia "First Republic of Armenia").<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-42">[40]</a></sup> It was clear to the Italians that the area allotted to them may not be easily given up by the Turkish Empire, such that the British Prime Minister proposed a vague formula for post-war adjustment should the actual post-war allocation not appear to be balanced.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016205_43-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016205-43">[41]</a></sup>

The lack of Russian consent to the Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne agreement was subsequently used by the British at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference to invalidate it, a position that greatly incensed the Italian government.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-44">[42]</a></sup>

Vereté describes how a dispute with the Ottoman Empire over the Eastern boundary of Egypt ended in 1906 when the borders were redrawn along the Rafa-Aqaba line and subsequently the fear of an attack on Egypt led to an increased strategic importance of "The hinterland of Sinai, western and eastern Palestine at least up to the Acre-Dar'a line".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEVereté197050_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTEVeret%C3%A9197050-45">[43]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-46">[44]</a></sup>

Hussein's letter of 18 February 1916 appealed to McMahon for £50,000 in gold plus weapons, ammunition and food claiming that Feisal was awaiting the arrival of "not less than 100,000 people" for the planned revolt and McMahon's reply of 10 March 1916 confirmed the British agreement to the requests and concluded the ten letters of the correspondence. In April and May, there were discussions initiated by Sykes as to the merits of a meeting to include Picot and the Arabs to mesh the desiderata of both sides. At the same time, logistics in relation to the promised revolt were being dealt with and there was a rising level of impatience for action to be taken by Hussein. Finally, at the end of April, McMahon was advised of the terms of Sykes–Picot and he and Grey agreed that these would not be disclosed to the Arabs.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016108–112_57-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016108%E2%80%93112-57">[55]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Twice_58-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Twice-58">[56]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 57–60">: 57–60 </span></sup>

Colonel [Édouard Brémond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Br%C3%A9mond "Édouard Brémond") was dispatched to Arabia in September 1916 as head of the French military mission to the Arabs. According to Cairo, Brémond was intent on containing the revolt so that the Arabs might not in any way threaten French interests in Syria. These concerns were not taken up in London, British-French cooperation was thought paramount and Cairo made aware of that.

As 1916 drew to a close, the [Asquith government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asquith_coalition_ministry "Asquith coalition ministry") which had been under increasing pressure and criticism mainly due to its conduct of the war, gave way on 6 December to David Lloyd George who had been critical of the war effort and had succeeded Kitchener as [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War "Secretary of State for War") after his untimely death in June. Lloyd George had wanted to make the destruction of the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") a major British war aim, and two days after taking office told Robertson that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem"), to impress British public opinion.<sup id="cite_ref-Woodfin_62-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Woodfin-62">[60]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 119–120">: 119–120 </span></sup>  The EEF were, at the time, in defensive mode at a line on the eastern edge of the [Sinai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinai_Peninsula "Sinai Peninsula") at [El Arish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Arish "El Arish") and 15 miles from the borders of Ottoman Palestine. Lloyd George "at once" consulted his War Cabinet about a "further campaign into Palestine when El Arish had been secured". Pressure from Lloyd George (over the reservations of [Chief of the General Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_General_Staff_(United_Kingdom) "Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)")) resulted in the capture of Rafa and the arrival of British forces at the borders of the Ottoman Empire.<sup id="cite_ref-Woodfin_62-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Woodfin-62">[60]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 47–49">: 47–49 </span></sup> 

#### Lloyd George Government (1917 onwards)\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Lloyd George Government (1917 onwards)")\]

Lloyd George set up a new small War Cabinet initially comprising Lords Curzon and Milner, Bonar Law, Arthur Henderson and himself; Hankey became the Secretary with Sykes, Ormsby-Gore and Amery as assistants. Although [Arthur Balfour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Balfour "Arthur Balfour") replaced Grey as Foreign Secretary, his exclusion from the War Cabinet and the activist stance of its members weakened his influence over foreign policy.<sup id="cite_ref-63"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-63">[61]</a></sup>

The French chose Picot as French High Commissioner for the soon to be occupied territory of Syria and Palestine. The British appointed Sykes as Chief Political Officer to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. On 3 April 1917, Sykes met with Lloyd George, Curzon and Hankey to receive his instructions in this regard, namely to keep the French onside while pressing for a British Palestine. First Sykes in early May and then Picot and Sykes together visited the [Hejaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz "Hejaz") later in May to discuss the agreement with Faisal and Hussein.<sup id="cite_ref-Twice_58-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Twice-58">[56]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 166">: 166 </span></sup>  Hussein was persuaded to agree to a formula to the effect that the French would pursue the same policy in Syria as the British in Baghdad; since Hussein believed that Baghdad would be part of the Arab State, that had eventually satisfied him. Later reports from participants expressed doubts about the precise nature of the discussions and the degree to which Hussein had really been informed as to the terms of Sykes–Picot.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016165_64-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016165-64">[62]</a></sup>

Italy's participation in the war, governed by the [Treaty of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_(1915) "Treaty of London (1915)"), eventually led to the [Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreement_of_Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne "Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne") in April 1917; at this conference, Lloyd George had raised the question of a British protectorate of Palestine and the idea "had been very coldly received" by the French and the Italians. The War Cabinet, reviewing this conference on 25 April, "inclined to the view that sooner or later the Sykes–Picot Agreement might have to be reconsidered ... No action should be taken at present in this matter".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016281_65-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016281-65">[63]</a></sup>

In between the meetings with Hussein, Sykes had informed London that "the sooner French Military Mission is removed from Hedjaz the better" and then [Lord Bertie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bertie,_1st_Viscount_Bertie_of_Thame "Francis Bertie, 1st Viscount Bertie of Thame") was instructed to request the same from the French on the grounds that the mission was hostile to the Arab cause and which "cannot but prejudice Allied relations and policy in the Hedjaz and may even affect whole future of French relations with the Arabs". After the French response to this, on 31 May 1917, [William Ormsby-Gore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ormsby-Gore,_4th_Baron_Harlech "William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech") wrote:

> The British Government, in authorising the letters despatched to King Hussein \[Sharif of Mecca\] before the outbreak of the revolt by Sir Henry McMahon, would seem to raise a doubt as to whether our pledges to King Hussein as head of the Arab nation are consistent with French intentions to make not only Syria but Upper Mesopotamia another Tunis. If our support of King Hussein and the other Arabian leaders of less distinguished origin and prestige means anything it means that we are prepared to recognize the full sovereign independence of the Arabs of Arabia and Syria. It would seem time to acquaint the French Government with our detailed pledges to King Hussein, and to make it clear to the latter whether he or someone else is to be the ruler of Damascus, which is the one possible capital for an Arab State, which could command the obedience of the other Arabian Emirs.<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-66">[64]</a></sup>

In a further sign of British discontent with Sykes–Picot, in August, Sykes penned a "Memorandum on the Asia Minor Agreement" that was tantamount to advocating its renegotiation else that it be made clear to the French that they "make good—that is to say that if they cannot make a military effort compatible with their policy they should modify their policy". After many discussions, Sykes was directed to conclude with Picot an agreement or supplement to Sykes–Picot ("Projet d'Arrangement") covering the "future status of the Hejaz and Arabia" and this was achieved by the end of September.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEFisher1999423_67-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFisher1999423-67">[65]</a></sup> However, by the end of the year, the agreement had yet to be ratified by the French Government.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016422_68-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016422-68">[66]</a></sup>

The [Balfour Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration "Balfour Declaration") along with its potential claim in Palestine was in the meantime issued on 2 November and the British entered Jerusalem on 9 December, with Allenby on foot 2 days later accompanied by representatives of the French and Italian detachments.

Excerpt from _[The Manchester Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manchester_Guardian "The Manchester Guardian")_, Monday, November 26, 1917. This was the first English-language reference to what became known as the Sykes-Picot Agreement.

Russian claims in the Ottoman Empire were denied following the [Bolshevik Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik_Revolution "Bolshevik Revolution") and the [Bolsheviks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks "Bolsheviks") released a copy of the Sykes–Picot Agreement (as well as other treaties). They revealed full texts in _[Izvestia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izvestia "Izvestia")_ and _[Pravda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravda "Pravda")_ on 23 November 1917; subsequently, _[The Manchester Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manchester_Guardian "The Manchester Guardian")_ printed the texts on 26 November 1917.<sup id="cite_ref-69"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-69">[67]</a></sup> That caused great embarrassment to the allies and growing distrust between them and the Arabs. Earlier, in April, the [Zionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist "Zionist") had confirmed the details of the Agreement with the British government.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016207_70-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016207-70">[68]</a></sup>

[U.S. President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._President "U.S. President") [Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson") had rejected all secret agreements made between the Allies and promoted open diplomacy as well as ideas about self-determination. On 22 November 1917, Leon Trotsky addressed a note to the ambassadors at Petrograd "containing proposals for a truce and a democratic peace without annexation and without indemnities, based on the principle of the independence of nations, and of their right to determine the nature of their own development themselves".<sup id="cite_ref-71"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-71">[69]</a></sup> Peace negotiations with the Quadruple Alliance—Germany, Austria–Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey—started at Brest–Litovsk one month later. On behalf of the Quadruple Alliance, [Count Czernin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottokar_Czernin "Ottokar Czernin"), replied on 25 December that the "question of State allegiance of national groups which possess no State independence" should be solved by "every State with its peoples independently in a constitutional manner", and that "the right of minorities forms an essential component part of the constitutional right of peoples to self-determination".<sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-72">[70]</a></sup>

In his turn, Lloyd George delivered a speech on war aims on 5 January, including references to the right of self-determination and "consent of the governed" as well as to secret treaties and the changed circumstances regarding them. Three days later, Wilson weighed in with his [Fourteen Points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Points "Fourteen Points"), the twelfth being that "the Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development".

On 23 December 1917, Sykes (who had been sent to France in mid-December to see what was happening with the Projet d'Arrangement) and a representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs had delivered public addresses to the [Central Syrian Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Syrian_Committee "Central Syrian Committee") at Paris<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-76">[c]</a></sup> in Paris on the non-Turkish elements of the Ottoman Empire, including liberated Jerusalem. Sykes had stated that the accomplished fact of the independence of the Hejaz rendered it almost impossible that an effective and real autonomy should be refused to Syria. However, the minutes also record that the Syrian Arabs in Egypt were not happy with developments and absent a clearer, less ambiguous statement in regard to the future of Syria and Mesopotamia then the Allies as well as the King of the Hedjaz would lose much Arab support.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-77">[74]</a></sup>

Sykes was the author of the [Hogarth Message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogarth_Message "Hogarth Message") a secret January 1918 message to Hussein following his request for an explanation of the Balfour Declaration and the [Bassett Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassett_Letter "Bassett Letter") was a letter (also secret) dated 8 February 1918 from the British Government to Hussein following his request for an explanation of the Sykes–Picot Agreement.

The failure of the Projet d'Arrangement reflected poorly on Sykes and following on from the doubts about his explanations of Sykes–Picot to Hussein the previous year, weakened his credibility on Middle Eastern affairs throughout 1918. Still (at his own request, now Acting Adviser on Arabian and Palestine Affairs at the Foreign Office) he continued his criticism of Sykes–Picot, minuting on 16 February that "the Anglo–French Agreement of 1916 in regard to Asia Minor should come up for reconsideration" and then on 3 March, writing to Clayton, "the stipulations in regard to the red and blue areas can only be regarded as quite contrary to the spirit of every ministerial speech that has been made for the last three months".

On 28 March 1918 the first meeting of the newly formed [Eastern Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Committee "Eastern Committee") was held, chaired by Curzon.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-78">[d]</a></sup>

In May, Clayton told Balfour that Picot had, in response to a suggestion that the agreement was moot, "allowed that considerable revision was required in view of changes that had taken place in the situation since agreement was drawn up", but nevertheless considered that "agreement holds, at any rate principle".

The British issued the [Declaration to the Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_to_the_Seven "Declaration to the Seven") on 16 June, the first British pronouncement to the Arabs advancing the principle of national self-determination.<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-79">[75]</a></sup>

On 30 September 1918, supporters of the [Arab Revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt "Arab Revolt") in Damascus declared a government loyal to the Sharif of Mecca. He had been declared King of the Arabs by a handful of religious leaders and other notables in Mecca.<sup id="cite_ref-80"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-80">[76]</a></sup>

The [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Revolt "Arab Revolt") and British armies entered Damascus on 1 October 1918, and on 3 October 1918 [Ali Rida al-Rikabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Rikabi "Ali Rikabi") was appointed Military Governor of [Occupied Enemy Territory Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_Enemy_Territory_Administration "Occupied Enemy Territory Administration") East.<sup id="cite_ref-Watson2003_81-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Watson2003-81">[77]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Tauber2014_82-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Tauber2014-82">[78]</a></sup> Faisal entered Damascus on 4 October and appointed Rikabi Chief of the Council of Directors (i.e. prime minister) of Syria.

On 5 October, with the permission of General Allenby, Faisal announced the establishment of a fully and absolutely independent Arab constitutional government.<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-83">[79]</a></sup> Faisal announced it would be an Arab government based on justice and equality for all Arabs regardless of religion.<sup id="cite_ref-Allawi2014_84-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Allawi2014-84">[80]</a></sup>

The [Anglo-French Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-French_Declaration "Anglo-French Declaration") of November 1918 pledged that Great Britain and France would "assist in the establishment of indigenous Governments and administrations in Syria and Mesopotamia" by "setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the free exercise of the initiative and choice of the indigenous populations". The French had reluctantly agreed to issue the declaration at the insistence of the British. Minutes of a British War Cabinet meeting reveal that the British had cited the laws of conquest and military occupation to avoid sharing the administration with the French under a civilian regime. The British stressed that the terms of the Anglo–French declaration had superseded the Sykes–Picot Agreement in order to justify fresh negotiations over the allocation of the territories of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-85">[81]</a></sup>

[George Curzon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Curzon,_1st_Marquess_Curzon_of_Kedleston "George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston") said the Great Powers were still committed to the [Règlement Organique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A8glement_Organique_(Mount_Lebanon) "Règlement Organique (Mount Lebanon)") agreement, which concerned governance and non-intervention in the affairs of the [Maronite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maronite "Maronite"), [Orthodox Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodoxy#Christianity "Orthodoxy"), [Druze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze "Druze") and [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim "Muslim") communities, regarding the [Beirut Vilayet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut_Vilayet "Beirut Vilayet") of June 1861 and September 1864, and added that the rights granted to France in what is today modern Syria and parts of Turkey under Sykes–Picot were incompatible with that agreement.<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-86">[82]</a></sup>

Mosul Vilayet in 1892

On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire had signed the [Armistice of Mudros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_of_Mudros "Armistice of Mudros"). On 2 November, the British occupied the Mosul Vilayet<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-87">[83]</a></sup> which led to the territorial dispute known as the [Mosul Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosul_Question "Mosul Question").

At the French embassy in London on Sunday 1 December, David Lloyd George and Clemenceau had a private and undocumented meeting where the latter surrendered French rights to Mosul (the city of Mosul and south to the Little Zab)<sup id="cite_ref-88"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-88">[84]</a></sup> and to Palestine that had been given by the Sykes–Picot Agreement.<sup id="cite_ref-90"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-90">[e]</a></sup> Although Lloyd George and others have suggested that nothing was given in return, according to Ian Rutledge and [James Barr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Barr_(author) "James Barr (author)"), Lloyd George promised at least one or even all of, support for French claims on the Ruhr, that when oil production in Mosul began, France would receive a share and that Sykes–Picot obligation would be maintained as regards Syria.<sup id="cite_ref-91"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-91">[86]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Rutledge2015_92-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Rutledge2015-92">[87]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Barr2011_93-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-Barr2011-93">[88]</a></sup>

The Eastern Committee met nine times in November and December to draft a set of resolutions on British policy for the benefit of the negotiators.<sup id="cite_ref-95"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-95">[90]</a></sup>

On 21 October, the War Cabinet asked Smuts to prepare the peace brief in summary form and he asked [Erle Richards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Erle_Richards "Henry Erle Richards") to carry out this task resulting in a "P-memo" for use by the [Peace Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919 "Paris Peace Conference, 1919") delegates.<sup id="cite_ref-96"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-96">[91]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-97"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-97">[92]</a></sup> The conclusions of the Eastern Committee at page 4 of the P-memo included as objectives the cancellation of Sykes–Picot and supporting the Arabs in their claim to a state with capital at Damascus (in line with the [McMahon–Hussein Correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence "McMahon–Hussein Correspondence")).<sup id="cite_ref-98"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-98">[93]</a></sup>

At the Peace Conference, which officially opened on 18 January, the [Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(World_War_I) "Big Four (World War I)") (initially a "Council of Ten" comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Japan, but Japan withdrew from the conference) agreed, on 30 January, the outlines of a [Mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations_mandate "League of Nations mandate") system (including three levels of Mandate) later to become Article 22 of the [League Covenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_of_the_League_of_Nations "Covenant of the League of Nations"). The Big Four would later decide which communities, under what conditions and which Mandatory.

Minutes taken during a meeting of The Big Four held in Paris on 20 March 1919 and attended by [Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson"), [Georges Clemenceau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Clemenceau "Georges Clemenceau"), [Vittorio Emanuele Orlando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Emanuele_Orlando "Vittorio Emanuele Orlando") as well as Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour,<sup id="cite_ref-99"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-99">[94]</a></sup> explained the British and French points of view concerning the agreement. It was the first topic brought up during the discussion of Syria and Turkey, and formed the focus of all discussions thereafter.

The Anglo-French Declaration was read into the minutes, Pichon commenting that it showed the disinterested position of both governments in regard to the Arabs and Lloyd George that it was "more important than all the old agreements".<sup id="cite_ref-digicoll.library.wisc.edu_100-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-digicoll.library.wisc.edu-100">[95]</a></sup> Pichon went on to mention a proposed scheme of agreement of 15 February based on the private agreement reached between Clemenceau and Lloyd George the previous December.<sup id="cite_ref-digicoll.library.wisc.edu_100-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-digicoll.library.wisc.edu-100">[95]</a></sup> (According to Lieshout, just before Faisal made his presentation to the conference on the 6th, Clemenceau handed Lloyd George a proposal which appears to cover the same subject matter; Lieshout having accessed related British materials dated the 6th whereas the date in the minutes is unsourced.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016340_et_seq_101-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016340_et_seq-101">[96]</a></sup>)

In the subsequent discussions, France staked its claim to Syria (and its mandate) while the British sought to carve out the Arab areas of zones A and B arguing that France had implicitly accepted such an arrangement even though it was the British that had entered into the arrangement with the Arabs.<sup id="cite_ref-102"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-102">[97]</a></sup>

Wilson intervened and stressed the principle of [consent of the governed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed "Consent of the governed") whether it be Syria or Mesopotamia, that he thought the issues involved the peace of the world and were not necessarily just a matter between France and Britain. He suggested that an Inter-Allied Commission be formed and sent out to find out the wishes of local inhabitants in the region. The discussion concluded with Wilson agreeing to draft a Terms of Reference to the commission.<sup id="cite_ref-103"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-103">[98]</a></sup>

On 21 April, Faisal left for the East. Before he left, on 17 April Clemenceau sent a draft letter, in which the French government declared that they recognized "the right of Syria to independence in the form of a federation of autonomous governments in agreement with the traditions and wishes of the populations", and claimed that Faisal had recognized "that France is the Power qualified to render Syria the assistance of various advisors necessary to introduce order and realise the progress demanded by the Syrian populations" and on 20 April, Faisal assured Clemenceau that he had been "Deeply impressed by the disinterested friendliness of your statements to me while I was in Paris, and must thank you for having been the first to suggest the dispatch of the inter-allied Commission, which is to leave shortly for the East to ascertain the wishes of the local peoples as to the future organisation of their country. I am sure that the people of Syria will know how to show you their gratitude."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016353_104-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016353-104">[99]</a></sup>

Meanwhile, as of late May, the standoff between the French and the British as to disposition of forces continued, the French continued to press for a replacement of British by French troops in Syria amid arguments about precise geographical limits of same and in general the relationship suffered; after the meeting on the 21st, Lloyd George had written to Clemenceau and cancelled the [Long–Bérenger Oil Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long%E2%80%93B%C3%A9renger_Oil_Agreement "Long–Bérenger Oil Agreement") (a revised version of which had been agreed at the end of April) claiming to have known nothing about it and not wanting it to become an issue while Clemenceau claimed that had not been the subject of any argument. There were also discussions as to what precisely had been agreed or not at the private meeting between Clemenceau and Lloyd George the previous December.<sup id="cite_ref-105"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-105">[100]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-106"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-106">[101]</a></sup>

In June 1919, the American [King–Crane Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%E2%80%93Crane_Commission "King–Crane Commission") arrived in Syria to inquire into local public opinion about the future of the country. After many vicissitudes, "mired in confusion and intrigue",<sup id="cite_ref-107"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-107">[102]</a></sup> "Lloyd George had second thoughts...",<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016352_108-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016352-108">[103]</a></sup> the French and British had declined to participate.<sup id="cite_ref-109"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-109">[104]</a></sup>

The [Syrian National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_National_Congress "Syrian National Congress") had been convened in May 1919 to consider the future of [Greater Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Syria "Greater Syria") and to present Arab views contained in a 2 July resolution<sup id="cite_ref-110"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-110">[105]</a></sup> to the King-Crane Commission.

The [Peace treaty with Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles "Treaty of Versailles") was signed on 28 June and with the departure of Wilson and Lloyd George from Paris, the result was that the Turkey/Syria question was effectively placed on hold.<sup id="cite_ref-111"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-111">[106]</a></sup>

On 15 September, the British handed out an Aide Memoire (which had been discussed privately two days before between Lloyd George and Clemenceau <sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELieshout2016374_112-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-FOOTNOTELieshout2016374-112">[107]</a></sup>) whereby the British would withdraw their troops to Palestine and Mesopotamia and hand over Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo to Faisal's forces. While accepting the withdrawal, Clemenceau continued to insist on the Sykes–Picot agreement as being the basis for all discussions.<sup id="cite_ref-113"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-113">[108]</a></sup>

On 18 September, Faisal arrived in London and the next day and on the 23rd had lengthy meetings with Lloyd George who explained the Aide Memoire and British position. Lloyd George explained that he was "in the position of a man who had inherited two sets of engagements, those to King Hussein and those to the French", Faisal noting that the arrangement "seemed to be based on the 1916 agreement between the British and the French". Clemenceau, replying in respect of the Aide Memoire, refused to move on Syria and said that the matter should be left for the French to handle directly with Faisal.

Faisal arrived in Paris on 20 October and eventually on 6 January 1920 Faisal accepted a French mandate "for the whole of Syria", while France in return consented "to the formation of an Arab state that included Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo, and was to be administered by the Emir with the assistance of French advisers" (acknowledged "the right of Syrians to unite to govern themselves as an independent nation".<sup id="cite_ref-114"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-114">[109]</a></sup>). In the meantime, British forces withdrew from Damascus on 26 November.

Faisal returned to Damascus on 16 January and [Millerand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Millerand "Alexandre Millerand") took over from Clemenceau on the 20th. A Syrian National Congress meeting in Damascus declared an independent state of Syria on 8 March 1920. The new state intended to include portions of Syria, Palestine, and northern Mesopotamia. Faisal was declared the head of State. At the same time Prince Zeid, Faisal's brother, was declared Regent of Mesopotamia.

In April 1920, the [San Remo conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Remo_conference "San Remo conference") handed out Class A mandates over Syria to France, and Iraq and Palestine to Britain. The same conference ratified [an oil agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Remo_Oil_Agreement "San Remo Oil Agreement") reached at a London conference on 12 February, based on a slightly different version of the Long Berenger agreement previously initialled in London on 21 December.

France had decided to govern Syria directly, and took action to enforce the [French Mandate of Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Mandate_of_Syria "French Mandate of Syria") before the terms had been accepted by the Council of the League of Nations. The French issued an ultimatum and intervened militarily at the [Battle of Maysalun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Maysalun "Battle of Maysalun") in June 1920. They deposed the indigenous Arab government, and removed King Faisal from Damascus in August 1920. Great Britain also appointed a [High Commissioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Samuel,_1st_Viscount_Samuel "Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel") and established their own mandatory regime in Palestine, without first obtaining approval from the Council of the League of Nations, or obtaining the formal cession of the territory from the former sovereign, Turkey.

### Iraq and the Persian Gulf\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Iraq and the Persian Gulf")\]

In November 1914, the British had occupied [Basra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basra "Basra"). According to the report of the [de Bunsen Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bunsen_Committee "De Bunsen Committee"), British interests in Mesopotamia were defined by the need to protect the western flank of India and protect commercial interests including oil. The British also became concerned about the [Berlin–Baghdad railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin%E2%80%93Baghdad_railway "Berlin–Baghdad railway"). Although never ratified, the British had also initialled the [Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Ottoman_Convention_of_1913 "Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913").

As part of the [Mesopotamian campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamian_campaign "Mesopotamian campaign"), on 11 March 1917, the British entered Baghdad, the [Armistice of Mudros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_of_Mudros "Armistice of Mudros") was signed on 30 October 1918 although the British continued their advance, entering Mosul on 2 November.

Following the award of the [British Mandate of Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Mesopotamia "British Mandate of Mesopotamia") at San Remo, the British were faced with an [Iraqi revolt against the British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_revolt_against_the_British "Iraqi revolt against the British") from July until February 1921, as well as [a Kurdish revolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Barzanji_revolts "Mahmud Barzanji revolts") in Northern Iraq. Following the [Cairo Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_Conference_(1921) "Cairo Conference (1921)") it was decided that Faisal should be installed as ruler in [Mandatory Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_Iraq "Mandatory Iraq").

### Kurds and Assyrians\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Kurds and Assyrians")\]

As originally cast, Sykes–Picot allocated part of Northern Kurdistan and a substantial part of the Mosul vilayet including the city of Mosul to France in area B, Russia obtained Bitlis and Van in Northern Kurdistan (the contemplated Arab State included Kurds in its Eastern limit split between A and B areas). Bowman says there were around 2.5 million Kurds in Turkey, mainly in the mountain region called [Kurdistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan "Kurdistan").<sup id="cite_ref-zgOzp_115-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-zgOzp-115">[110]</a></sup>

Partitioning of Ottoman Empire according to the aborted Treaty of Sèvres

[Şerif Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Eerif_Pasha "Şerif Pasha") known as Sharif Pasha presented a "Memorandum on the Claims of the Kurd People" to the [Paris Peace Conference in 1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919 "Paris Peace Conference, 1919") and the suppressed report of the [King–Crane Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%E2%80%93Crane_Commission "King–Crane Commission") also recommended a form of autonomy in "the natural geographical area which lies between the proposed Armenia on the north and Mesopotamia on the south, with the divide between the Euphrates and the Tigris as the western boundary, and the Persian frontier as the eastern boundary".

The Russians gave up territorial claims following the Bolshevik revolution and at the [San Remo conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Remo_conference "San Remo conference"), the French were awarded the [French Mandate of Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Mandate_of_Syria "French Mandate of Syria") and the English the [British Mandate of Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Mesopotamia "British Mandate of Mesopotamia"). The subsequent [Treaty of Sèvres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_S%C3%A8vres "Treaty of Sèvres") potentially provided for a Kurdish territory subject to a referendum and League of Nations sanction within a year of the treaty. However, the [Turkish War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_War_of_Independence "Turkish War of Independence") led to the treaty being superseded by the [Treaty of Lausanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne "Treaty of Lausanne") in which there was no provision for a Kurdish State.

The result was that the Kurds, along with their Assyrian neighbors, were divided between Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran.

## Conflicting promises and consequences\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Conflicting promises and consequences")\]

Many sources contend that Sykes–Picot conflicted with the Hussein–McMahon Correspondence of 1915–1916 and that the publication of the agreement in November 1917 caused the resignation of Sir [Henry McMahon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_McMahon "Henry McMahon").<sup id="cite_ref-116"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-116">[111]</a></sup> There were several points of difference, the most obvious being Iraq placed in the British red area and less obviously, the idea that British and French advisors would be in control of the area designated as being for an Arab State. Lastly, while the correspondence made no mention of Palestine, Haifa and Acre were to be British and the brown area (a reduced Palestine) internationalised.<sup id="cite_ref-117"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-117">[112]</a></sup>

Leading up to the [centenary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenary "Centenary") of Sykes–Picot in 2016, great interest was generated among the media<sup id="cite_ref-118"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-118">[113]</a></sup> and academia<sup id="cite_ref-119"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement#cite_note-119">[114]</a></sup> concerning the long-term effects of the agreement.

The Russian foreign minister declared his government's willingness to support the suggestions of Britain and France in return for their backing of Russian territorial claims in northeastern Anatolia. To these claims the two Western allies-France on 13/26 April and England on 10/23 May 1916-gave their sanction, although final clarification did not take place until 10/23 October 1916. The Entente governments formalized the tripartite understanding-commonly labeled the Sykes–Picot agreement though alternately known in the British War Cabinet as the Asia Minor Agreement – in an exchange of eleven letters."
