## Berkeley parents, teachers, and students are appalled by the defamatory complaint against their school district by the Anti-Defamation League and the Brandeis Center, an Israel advocacy organization with pro-Trump ties. 

The complaint, with information from a handful of parents who have been harassing our teachers and students, is replete with lies and puts our 9,400 students and hundreds of teachers in harm’s way. It coincided with a bomb hoax email sent to all our schools. 
 
We reject the complaint’s false conflation of antisemitism and criticism of the state of Israel and its military assault on Palestinians. Jewish safety and Palestinian freedom are intertwined. The danger of antisemitism comes from white nationalism, not from those who support Palestinian human rights and freedom. 

Berkeley is a wholesome, progressive, and loving community that overwhelmingly supports its teachers, Black and Brown solidarity and a ceasefire in Gaza. Our students are heartbroken about the destruction in Gaza and the way their teachers are being silenced.

Our students - including our Jewish students - are not at peace knowing that more than 13,000 children have been murdered by Israel and a million children in Gaza have been out of school for more than 5 months because of Israel’s relentless bombing campaign that has wiped out all schools and colleges in the strip.

"Israel can wake away girls like me but they can't wake away their stories.
I don't know what we're told not to talk about the Israel's world of power side because
different people believe different things.
I believe in truth.
And the issue is based on facts.
Not the truth.
I want to be taught the truth.
Even in its heart there are some people to hear.
The history of power side and power side resistance to Israel should be taught in schools
just like the history of Native Americans and the history of African Americans.
It's the same as me to be known.
Israel can wake away girls like me but they can't wake away their stories.
They're not in the need.
Long live the truth.
Long live the real education.
Long live power side.
Long live the real education."
