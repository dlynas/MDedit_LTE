### Bolivia\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeffrey_Sachs&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Bolivia")\]

When [Bolivia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia "Bolivia") was shifting from a dictatorship to a democracy through national elections in 1985, Sachs was invited by the party of Bolivian dictator [Hugo Banzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Banzer "Hugo Banzer") to advise him on an anti-[inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation") economic plan to implement once he was voted to office. This stabilization plan centered on price deregulation, particularly for oil, along with cuts to the national budget. Sachs stated that his plan could end Bolivian [hyperinflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation "Hyperinflation"), which had reached up to 14,000%, in a single day.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Primary,_secondary_and_tertiary_sources" title="Wikipedia:No original research"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable secondary sources.

Inflation quickly stabilized in Bolivia.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

Sachs' suggestion for reducing inflation was to apply fiscal and monetary discipline<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon. (January 2023)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> and end economic regulation that protected the elites<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="The text near this tag may need clarification or removal of jargon.

Hyperinflation reduced within weeks of the Bolivian government instituting his suggestions and the government settled its $3.3 billion debt to international lenders for about 11 cents on the dollar. At the time, this was about 85% of Bolivia's GDP.<sup id="cite_ref-nyt270693_31-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-nyt270693-31">[31]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>

### Advising in post-communist economies\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeffrey_Sachs&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Advising in post-communist economies")\]

Sachs has worked as an economic adviser to governments in [Latin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America "Latin America"), [Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe "Eastern Europe") and the former [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"). A practice trained [macroeconomist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomist "Macroeconomist"), he advised a number of national governments in the transition from [Marxism–Leninism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism "Marxism–Leninism") or [developmentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmentalism "Developmentalism") to market economies.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In 1989, Sachs advised Poland's [anticommunist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticommunist "Anticommunist") [Solidarity movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union) "Solidarity (Polish trade union)") and the government of Prime Minister [Tadeusz Mazowiecki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadeusz_Mazowiecki "Tadeusz Mazowiecki"). He wrote a comprehensive plan for the transition from [central planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet-type_economic_planning "Soviet-type economic planning") to a [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy "Market economy") which became incorporated into Poland's reform program led by Finance Minister [Leszek Balcerowicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leszek_Balcerowicz "Leszek Balcerowicz"). Sachs was the main architect of Poland's debt reduction operation. Sachs and IMF economist David Lipton advised the rapid conversion of all property and assets from public to private ownership. Closure of many uncompetitive factories ensued.<sup id="cite_ref-Hardy_2009_33-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Hardy_2009-33">[33]</a></sup> In Poland, Sachs was firmly on the side of rapid transition to capitalism. At first, he proposed American-style corporate structures, with professional managers answering to many shareholders and a large economic role for stock markets. That did not bode well with the Polish authorities, but he then proposed that large blocks of the shares of privatized companies be placed in the hands of private banks.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> As a result, there were some economic [shortages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortages "Shortages") and [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation"), but prices in Poland eventually stabilized.<sup id="cite_ref-Foreign_Affairs_35-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Foreign_Affairs-35">[35]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Independent_sources" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources"><span title="This claim needs a reference to a independent, third-party source. (July 2015)">third-party source needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The government of Poland awarded Sachs with one of its highest honors in 1999, the Commander's Cross of the [Order of Merit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Merit_of_the_Republic_of_Poland "Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland").<sup id="cite_ref-EICBio_36-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-EICBio-36">[36]</a></sup> He also received an honorary doctorate from the [Kraków University of Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_University_of_Economics "Kraków University of Economics").<sup id="cite_ref-ContempAuthors_21-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-ContempAuthors-21">[21]</a></sup>

Sachs's ideas and methods of transition from central planning were adopted throughout the transition economies. He advised [Slovenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia "Slovenia") in 1991 and [Estonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia "Estonia") in 1992 on the introduction of new stable and convertible currencies.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Based on Poland's success, his advice was sought first by Soviet President [Mikhail Gorbachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev") and by his successor, Russian President [Boris Yeltsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin "Boris Yeltsin"), on the transition of the USSR/Russia to a market economy.<sup id="cite_ref-NPR_2022_37-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-NPR_2022-37">[37]</a></sup> He was adviser to Prime Minister [Yegor Gaidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yegor_Gaidar "Yegor Gaidar") and Finance Minister Boris Federov during 1991–1993 on macroeconomic policies.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Sachs' methods for stabilizing economies became known as [shock therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_therapy_(economics) "Shock therapy (economics)") and were similar to successful approaches used in Germany after the two world wars.<sup id="cite_ref-nyt270693_31-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-nyt270693-31">[31]</a></sup> However, he faced criticism for his role after the Russian economy faced signficicant struggles after adopting the market-based shock therapy in the early 1990s.<sup id="cite_ref-McClintick_38-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-McClintick-38">[38]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ds101120_39-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-ds101120-39">[39]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_40-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-:0-40">[40]</a></sup>

### Work on global economic development\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeffrey_Sachs&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Work on global economic development")\]

Since his work in post-communist countries, Sachs has turned to global issues of [economic development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development "Economic development"), [poverty alleviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_alleviation "Poverty alleviation"), [health and aid policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_policy "Health policy") and [environmental sustainability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_sustainability "Environmental sustainability"). He has written extensively on [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change "Climate change"), [disease control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health "Public health") and [globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization "Globalization"). Since 1995, he has been engaged in efforts to alleviate [poverty in Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_Africa "Poverty in Africa").<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> According to _[New York Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Magazine "New York Magazine")_,

> Sachs’s ambitions are hard to overstate... “His ultimate goal is to change the world — to ‘bend history,’ as he once said, quoting [Robert F. Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy "Robert F. Kennedy"),” wrote [Nina Munk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Munk "Nina Munk") in _The Idealist_, a biography of Sachs. By the early aughts, he had risen from wonky academic to celebrity public intellectual. According to Munk, people in Sachs’s inner circle affectionately called him a “shit disturber,” someone whose ego was offset by a selfless genius and a penchant for challenging orthodoxies. “There’s a certain messianic quality about him,” [George Soros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros "George Soros"), one of his patrons, told Munk.<sup id="cite_ref-Walsh_2023_41-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Walsh_2023-41">[41]</a></sup>

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Sachs_at_UN.jpg/220px-Sachs_at_UN.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sachs_at_UN.jpg)

Sachs at a UN meeting in 2009

In his 2005 work _[The End of Poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Poverty "The End of Poverty")_, which had a foreword by Bono,<sup id="cite_ref-Walsh_2023_41-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Walsh_2023-41">[41]</a></sup> Sachs wrote that "Africa's governance is poor because Africa is poor". According to Sachs, with the right policies and key interventions, [extreme poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_poverty "Extreme poverty")—defined as living on less than $1 a day—can be eradicated within 20 years. India and China are examples, with the latter lifting 300 million people out of extreme poverty during the last two decades. Sachs has said that a key element to accomplishing this is raising aid from $65 billion in 2002 to $195 billion a year by 2015. He emphasizes the role of geography and climate as much of Africa is landlocked and disease-prone. However, he stresses that these problems can be overcome.<sup id="cite_ref-UNMP_42-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-UNMP-42">[42]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Independent_sources" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources"><span title="This claim needs a reference to a independent, third-party source. (July 2015)">third-party source needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Sachs suggests that with improved seeds, irrigation and fertilizer, the [crop yields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yields "Crop yields") in Africa and other places with [subsistence farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsistence_farming "Subsistence farming") can be increased from 1 ton per hectare to 3 to 5 tons per hectare. He reasons that increased harvests would significantly increase the income of subsistence farmers, thereby reducing poverty. Sachs does not believe that increased aid is the only solution. He also supports establishing [credit and microloan programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit "Microcredit") which are often lacking in impoverished areas.<sup id="cite_ref-UUNCDF_43-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-UUNCDF-43">[43]</a></sup> Sachs advocates the distribution of free [insecticide-treated bed nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_nets "Bed nets") to combat malaria. The economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa $12 billion per year. Sachs estimates that malaria can be controlled for $3 billion per year, therefore suggesting that anti-malaria projects would be an economically justified investment.<sup id="cite_ref-Medical_News_Today_44-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Medical_News_Today-44">[44]</a></sup>

The [Millennium Villages Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Villages_Project "Millennium Villages Project") (MVP) which he directs operates in more than a dozen African countries and covers more than 500,000 people. The MVP has created controversy because critics have questioned both the design of the project and claims made for its success. In 2012, _[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist "The Economist")_ reviewed the project and concluded "the evidence does not yet support the claim that the millennium villages project is making a decisive impact".<sup id="cite_ref-45"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> Critics have pointed to the failure to include suitable controls that would allow an accurate determination of whether the MVP methods were responsible for any observed gains in economic development. A 2012 _Lancet_ paper claiming a three-fold increase in the rate of decline in childhood mortality was criticized for flawed methodology and the authors later admitted that the claim was "unwarranted and misleading".<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> In her 2013 book, _The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty_, journalist [Nina Munk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Munk "Nina Munk") concluded that the MVP was a failure.<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

Following the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000, Sachs chaired the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (2000–2001) which played a pivotal role in scaling up the financing of health care and disease control in the low-income countries to support MDGs 4, 5 and 6. He worked with UN Secretary-General [Kofi Annan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan "Kofi Annan") in 2000–2001 to design and launch [The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Global_Fund_to_Fight_AIDS,_Tuberculosis_and_Malaria "The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria").<sup id="cite_ref-Mountains_Beyond_Mountains_48-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Mountains_Beyond_Mountains-48">[48]</a></sup> He also worked with senior officials of the [George W. Bush administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_administration "George W. Bush administration") to develop the PEPFAR program to fight [HIV/AIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS "HIV/AIDS") and the PMI to fight [malaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria "Malaria"). On behalf of Annan, from 2002 to 2006 he chaired the [UN Millennium Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Millennium_Project "UN Millennium Project") which was tasked with developing a concrete action plan to achieve the MDGs. The UN General Assembly adopted the key recommendations of the UN Millennium Project at a special session in September 2005.

### COVID-19\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeffrey_Sachs&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: COVID-19")\]

Early in the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic"), Sachs vocally rejected the [COVID-19 lab leak theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory "COVID-19 lab leak theory") (a version of which was being supported by President [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump")), which posited the [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2 "SARS-CoV-2") virus was released from a Chinese laboratory, denouncing it as "reckless and dangerous" and arguing that right-wing politicians pointing fingers at the [Wuhan Institute of Virology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology "Wuhan Institute of Virology") could "push the world to conflict... Neither the biology nor chronology support the laboratory-release story."<sup id="cite_ref-Walsh_2023_41-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Walsh_2023-41">[41]</a></sup>

In spring 2020, [Richard Horton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Horton_(editor) "Richard Horton (editor)"), editor of _[The Lancet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet "The Lancet")_, appointed Sachs as chair of its [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19") Commission, whose goals were to provide recommendations for public health policy and improve the practice of medicine.<sup id="cite_ref-62"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-telegraph_63-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-telegraph-63">[63]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Cohen_2022_pp._126–126_64-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Cohen_2022_pp._126%E2%80%93126-64">[64]</a></sup> Sachs set up a number of task forces, including one on the [origins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigations_into_the_origin_of_COVID-19 "Investigations into the origin of COVID-19") of the virus. Sachs appointed British American disease ecologist [Peter Daszak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Daszak "Peter Daszak"), a colleague of Sachs' at Columbia, to head this task force, two weeks after the Trump administration prematurely ended a federal grant supporting a project led by Daszak, [EcoHealth Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EcoHealth_Alliance "EcoHealth Alliance"), which worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.<sup id="cite_ref-Walsh_2023_41-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Walsh_2023-41">[41]</a></sup> This appointment was criticized as creating a conflict of interest, for instance by [Richard Ebright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ebright "Richard Ebright"), chemical biologist at [Rutgers University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University "Rutgers University"), who called the commission an "entirely [Potemkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village "Potemkin village") commission" in the _[National Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review "National Review")_. However, as Sachs became increasingly drawn to the lab leak theory, he came into conflict with Daszak and his task force, forcing his resignation in summer 2021 and disbanding the group in September that year.<sup id="cite_ref-Walsh_2023_41-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Walsh_2023-41">[41]</a></sup>

In July 2022, Sachs said he was "pretty convinced," though "not sure" that [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19") came out of "US lab biotechnology," which is considered by the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union "European Union") to be [COVID-19 disinformation by China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_disinformation_by_China "COVID-19 disinformation by China"). While Sachs has leanings toward the possibility of a virus leak from a "U.S.-backed laboratory research program," he has stated that "A natural spillover is also possible, of course. Both hypotheses are viable at this stage."<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>

In August 2022, Sachs gave an hour-long interview on the podcast of [anti-vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-vaccine "Anti-vaccine") conspiracy theorist [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr. "Robert F.

In September 2022, the Lancet commission published a wide-ranging report on the pandemic, including commentary on the virus origin overseen by Sachs. The report suggested that the virus may have originated from an American laboratory.<sup id="cite_ref-Lawson_2022_67-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Lawson_2022-67">[67]</a></sup> Virologists reacting to this, including [Angela Rasmussen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Rasmussen "Angela Rasmussen"), commented that the release may have been "one of _The Lancet'_s most shameful moments regarding its role as a steward and leader in communicating crucial findings about science and medicine."<sup id="cite_ref-lancet-react_68-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-lancet-react-68">[68]</a></sup> Virologist [David Robertson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Robertson_(virologist) "David Robertson (virologist)") said the suggestion of US laboratory involvement was "wild speculation" and that "it's really disappointing to see such a potentially influential report contributing to further misinformation on such an important topic."<sup id="cite_ref-lancet-react_68-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-lancet-react-68">[68]</a></sup>

In May 2022, Sachs said that the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine") in February 2022 would be hard to beat and that [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland "Finland")'s moves to join [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO "NATO") would undermine a negotiated peace: "All of this talk of defeating Russia, to my mind, is reckless."<sup id="cite_ref-Ng_2022_69-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Ng_2022-69">[69]</a></sup> In June 2022, he co-signed an open letter calling for a "ceasefire" in the war, questioning Western countries' [continuing military support for Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War "List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War").<sup id="cite_ref-70"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup>

### Economics\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeffrey_Sachs&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Economics")\]

Sachs's economic philosophies have been the subject of controversy.<sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> [Nina Munk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Munk "Nina Munk"), author of the 2013 book _The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty_, says that, although well intended, poverty eradication projects endorsed by Sachs have years later "left people even worse off than before".<sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Vice2020_75-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Vice2020-75">[75]</a></sup>

[William Easterly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Easterly "William Easterly"), a professor of economics at [New York University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University "New York University"), reviewed _[The End of Poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Poverty "The End of Poverty")_ for the _[Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post "Washington Post")_, calling Sachs' poverty eradication plan "a sort of [Great Leap Forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward "Great Leap Forward")".<sup id="cite_ref-WPost_76-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-WPost-76">[76]</a></sup> According to Easterly's cross-country statistical analysis in his book _The White Man's Burden_, from 1985 to 2006, "When we control both for initial poverty and for bad government, it is bad government that explains the slower growth. We cannot statistically discern any effect of initial poverty on subsequent growth once we control for bad government. This is still true if we limit the definition of bad government to corruption alone." Easterly deems the massive aid proposed by Sachs to be ineffective, as its effect will be hampered by bad governance and/or [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption "Corruption").<sup id="cite_ref-Easterly_Easterly_2006_77-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-Easterly_Easterly_2006-77">[77]</a></sup>

Commenting on Sachs' $120 million effort to aid Africa, American travel writer and novelist [Paul Theroux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Theroux "Paul Theroux") says these temporary measures failed to create sustained improvements. Theroux focuses on a project in a sparsely populated community of [nomadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic "Nomadic") camel herders in Dertu, [Kenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya "Kenya"), funded by Sachs' Millennium Villages Project, which cost US$2.5 million over a three-year period. Theroux says that the project's [latrines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrine "Latrine") were clogged and overflowing, the dormitories it built quickly became dilapidated, and the livestock market it established ignored local customs and was shut down within a few months. He says that an angry Dertu citizen filed a 15-point written complaint against Sachs's operation, claiming it "created dependence" and that "the project is supposed to be bottom top approached but it is visa \[_[sic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic "Sic")_\] versa."<sup id="cite_ref-barr_Africa's_Aid_78-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-barr_Africa's_Aid-78">[78]</a></sup>

According to the Canadian journalist [Naomi Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Klein "Naomi Klein"), Jeffrey Sachs is one of the architects of "disaster capitalism" after his recommendations in Bolivia, Poland and Russia led to millions of people ending up [in the streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness "Homelessness").<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup>

In December 2018, [Huawei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei "Huawei") [Chief Financial Officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Financial_Officer "Chief Financial Officer") [Meng Wanzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Wanzhou "Meng Wanzhou") was arrested in Canada at the request of the U.S., which was seeking her extradition to face charges of allegedly violating [sanctions against Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran "Sanctions against Iran"). Soon after Meng's arrest, Sachs wrote an article in which he said her arrest was part of efforts to contain China and accused the U.S. of hypocrisy for seeking her extradition. He wrote that none of the executives of several U.S. companies which had been fined for sanctions violations were arrested.

In June 2020, Sachs said the targeting of Huawei by the US was not solely about security.<sup id="cite_ref-bbc210620_82-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sachs#cite_note-bbc210620-82">[82]</a></sup> In their 2020 book _[Hidden Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Hand_(book) "Hidden Hand (book)")_, [Clive Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Hamilton "Clive Hamilton") and [Mareike Ohlberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mareike_Ohlberg "Mareike Ohlberg") commented on one of Sachs' articles in which he accused the U.S. government of maligning Huawei under hypocritical pretenses. Hamilton and Ohlberg wrote that Sachs' article would be more meaningful and influential if he did not have a close relationship with Huawei, including his previous endorsement of the company's "vision of our shared digital future".
