## Making someone's day ‚ù§ A compliment goes a long way. Also if your inner voice does not sound kind, compliment yourself also. 
.

.
Not easy to do when your inner voice isn't kind. But why isn't it?
.
You could have picked up a thinking style of an inner critic from your peers etc or it could be being influenced by a core belief. Core beliefs are the meanings that we make of the world, ourselves, others, things. We gather these meanings from the perceptions that we have from the past events in our lives.
.
Examples 
.
Parents divorce
It their fault, I dont trust others
.
Its my fault, I am unlovable 
.
Panic response 
Its panics fault, that is the problem my mind and body will let me down. 
.
Its my fault I panicked, I am broken 
Ect.
.
It's these past ideas, core beleifs/meanings that we carry subconsciously or conciously that influneces thinking styles. 
.
Beliefs create thoughts, feelings, behaviours, outcomes 
.
Thoughts influence beliefs that create feelings, behaviours outcomes.
.
Behaviours influnece thoughts, feelings, can make a core belief seem more believable.
.
Etc 
The good news is we can work on/with our core beliefs, our thoughts and our behaviours.
.
A concious effort to have a kind word can help, and being kind to others brings a sense of purpose, but to get the the route is to understand, Indentify, work with a core belief.
.
If you need a hand ‚úã and we all do at some point to make changes, by finding out how.

"I love your lavender blue color scheme.
Goes with the blueberries as well.
Clearly a man with an eye for detail.
You have a very confident stride.
Sorry.
Very confident stride.
Loved it.
I adored the way you laughed at that pity.
Compliments are simple, but not easy. Trust me.
You have a marvelous weight distribution between your feet, sir.
Good easy shift.
Especially for us Brits.
Present company included.
I can give them and do, but I can't take.
Oh, man, you're so cute.
I was just laughing.
I'll be...
Oh, come on.
I'll go, then.
Doesn't mean I don't love it.
You look great.
Yorkshire compliment, that's cast and girl.
Sincerely appreciating something someone has made an effort on
will make their day.
Sir, you're an aquamarine blue jeans filled of dreams.
Yes, you are.
You're doing a wonderful job.
You had a tricky set of circumstances.
You're welcome.
You look like a painting.
You're just sitting there. It's fantastic.
The more unique, the more bespoke,
the more devastatingly effective.
You're a vibe of this genius artist
turned creative corporate legend.
Beautiful.
Safe and stylish.
You look pensive, but also capable enough to deal with anything
that's worrying you.
You have ski resort-earning energy.
Oh, I like it.
Sweet vibes, sir.
Human ibif and sunset.
OK.
Get it right.
And it's like a natural high for the pair of you.
Do your heads, sir.
Love it.
Wisdom.
Should be cast in marble.
See?
We both feel like we've had a coffee. "
