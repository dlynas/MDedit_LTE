	Yes, in the section called ‘refutation of idealism’ he argues against idealism about the external world, the phenomenal world. He argues that our time consciousness must be grounded in something other than parts of consciousness, and so an objectively existing world must exist as a stable reference.

		Ok, but since he also thinks our mind (sort of) creates reality (based of off the noumenon), how can he say who’s perspective is the correct/objective one? Or is it like majority consensus? 
		
		Like this might sound weird, but what about some guy who is imagining someone- what would Kant say about that? That imaginary person is objectively not “real”, because other people don’t see it?

			Kant argues that the world conforms to our minds in the same way. Both the form of our sensory experience the world, in time and space, and the way we understand those sensations, the categories. The categories and forms of intuition make it so we have same world.
			
			As for the hallucinated person, that person is only subjectively real for the person seeing them. But it is not objectively real since there is no object correlate

				Kant was not aware of evolution by natural selection he missed out on understanding that we are shaped by objective reality. I have to wonder what he would have make of Wallace and Darwin's work on evolution by natural selection. After all the environment cannot not have shaped our brains and thus our minds.

					Kant as basically all 18th century people had very wierd views about evolution and genetics (in a broad sense, as transmission of hereditary traits). 
					
					But it it makes perfect sense for Kant to say that we as humans are shaped by both our hereditary background and our environment. My point was that the world you experience, understand and live in is the same as my world, because it is construed through the same set of pure concepts and forms of intuition

						Darwin didn't get it either though he did understand that sex was not blended as he thought about the rest of the characteristics. 
						
						>because it is construed through the same set of pure concepts and forms of intuition
						
						Because we have the same biochemistry in our senses, mostly. Color vision shows that people can think they have same perceptions until they find out that they are red-green color blind. Concepts are not involved, just the biochemistry. The concepts are based on that, sometimes the concepts are wrong but the perceptions are still the same. For vision, barring optical illusions where our brains may indeed be affected by concepts. Mostly its the biochemistry of the senses.
						
						Again Kant didn't know any of that. 
						
						Concepts are rarely pure so no that part is just an opinion that may not reflect reality. I really think that philosophy students need to be better educated in science. Maybe its just the philophans and not the actual students. The nonsense from them in the r/consciousness is amazing considering how certain they are.

			Evidence shows that minds are aspect of our brains and those evolved via natural selection by the environment. Our senses are close enough most of the time but not all of the time. That is why scientists use tools, including mathematics, which can objectively measure things even things we cannot sense, including but remotely limited to Neutrinos.
			
			More phans of philosophy seem to failed to get the message that Kant accepted an objective reality. I would have far less issues with philophans if they would get that and maybe take a logic class as well.

	I worry that there's a lot of confusion here, and to sort it out it would help to begin by making sure we have a sense of what objective and subjective mean. Kant is very concerned indeed with securing objectivity, by which he understands what need be true (or false, if we're speaking of objective falsity) regardless of who is judging it. If you mean something other than this by objective, then we'll have to sort out how we're going to use this term.

	Next, it's important to clarify that "the phenomenal world" is *not* our mental or interior experience as distinct from things outside us, "the phenomenal world" is *not* what is in our heads as opposed to what isn't, it's not even *firstly* our mental or interior experience or what is in our heads, leaving us to ask the question of whether it's also anything else. None of these notions are what Kant means by "the phenomenal world". For Kant, "the phenomenal world" includes both our mental states *and* the states of bodies outside us, and includes them both equiprimordially -- it has nothing to do with starting with our certainty in our mental states and making inferences about the possible bodies outside of us.

	Let's turn to your question: is there objective reality in the phenomenal world? Yes! Indeed, this is exactly where objective reality most clearly is, for Kant. The entire project of *The Critique of Pure Reason* is oriented around establishing the objectivity of the phenomenal world, beginning with the objectivity of mathematics in relation to space and time, and then moving on to the objectivity of natural science in relation to the categories.

	There's nothing here about perspectivalism, how we all have our own phenomenal worlds, or whatever else like this. This is the opposite of the point Kant is trying to make -- if you want something like this, you're much better off turning to Nietzsche than to Kant, and precisely where Nietzsche thinks himself to be specifically anti-Kantian. Kant's project is to secure objectivity -- yes, in the phenomenal world, which is where we'd expect it to be, once we correct misunderstandings of this expression.

	Whether there's any objectivity as regards *the noumenal world* is the question that *The Critique of Pure Reason* renders a challenge. Its point of this text if in many ways the opposite of what it's often imagined to be in popular discussion.

		>For Kant, "the phenomenal world" includes both our mental states and the states of bodies outside us  
		
		Okay but the phenomenal world still always refers to how things are *relative* to our cognition even when we talk of the objective states of bodies outside us, right?  If that’s not the case then I guess I don’t grasp the phenomenal/ noumenal distinction!

		* 🟧 **[wokeupabug](https://www.reddit.com/user/wokeupabug)** ⬆️ 3 _(2024-02-04 19:53:43)_

			There is a worry that the expression "cognition" tends to be construed in a way that refers to psychology, in the sense of various (presumably contingent) determinations of mind which we determine by virtue of our experience with it. If that's what we mean, then, no, that's probably not right. Or, again, if by "cognition" we mean, even more generally, mind or mental operations, then either *no, that's not right*, or, at least, it's no more right than is the converse: that when we talk of the objective states of mind or mental operations we do so *relative* to the bodies outside it.
			
			We might instead have in mind here, not anything mental or psychological in anything like the aforementioned sense, but only a constructive account of what it is to intuit or to think an object. These are presumably different things, like the sense that an account of what it is to make a move in chess is not the same as an account of any particular moves in chess that have been made, nor of any particular habits or other tendencies or capacities to make any particular movies in chess. If that's the sort of thing we mean, then sure: the phenomenal world is to be understood in relation to a constructive account of what it is to intuit or think an object.
			
			Though one might wonder how else it could ever be understood. And the first answer, for Kant, would be the one just given: the phenomenal world is to be understood in relation to a constructive account of what it is to think or intuit an object *and not* in relation to a psychological account of minds. And we can already see from this how far he is from from the kind of perspectivalism or subjectivism people -- like perhaps the OP -- often imagine is his implication. The whole difference between Hume and Kant is that Kant makes this move.
			
			To whom does "our" refer, then, if by "cognition" we understand only a constructive account of what it is to think or intuit an object? It is superfluous here? No, it's neither superfluous nor does it admit of a reference implying a psychology. The fundamental significance of "our", for Kant, is a reference to finitude and discursiveness. Though, in a sense, this is redundant: he doesn't think you can give an account of what it is to think that is not an account of what is finite and discursive. Though, he does admit that one might give such an account for what it is to intuit, and in any case the reference, even if redundant, is significant: the phenomenal world is to be understood (i) *not* in relation to a psychology but in relation to a constructive account of what it is to think or intuit, and (ii) *not* in relation to the thoughts (were this possible) or intuitions of the infinite and nondiscursive, but in relation to those of the finite and discursive -- viz., the phenomenal world is to be understood not in relation to what it would be (were this possible) to God, but rather in relation to what it would be to *us*, i.e. we who are not God, we who are finite and discursive.
			
			These are the two fundamental steps Kant is taking here. If you want a complication or caveat, he doesn't think we can infer space and time from finitude and discursivity, but rather as finite and discursive can only find ourselves thrown into a situation where space and time are forms for us.

				Thanks for the detailed response. You’ve given me a lot to chew on here.  
				
				I just have a question about terminology if you don’t mind. What exactly does ‘discursive’/‘discursivity’ mean in this context? Does it simply refer to our capacity to make inferences, judge, apply concepts etc, or something more specific? (Whereas God apprehends things nondiscursively, meaning in an unmediated fashion?)

				* 🟪 **[wokeupabug](https://www.reddit.com/user/wokeupabug)** ⬆️ 2 _(2024-02-04 22:31:11)_

					Discursive has the sense of *conceptual* here, but moreover in the context where *conceptual* has the implication of a kind of mediated or indirect working through of a thing by way of organizing in certain ways its individual moments, like how I get a visual representation of a barn only by moving around it and putting together the different vantage points, or situating a given vantage point from within the context of such an organization.
					
					According to Kant, for "us" (i) intuition is *sensible*, meaning we present an object by way of it affecting some passive capacity of ours in a certain way, and then (ii) understanding is *discursive*, meaning we present a concept by way of ordering a certain manifold of intuitions or other concepts according to a certain rule. Whereas God would have, instead of sensible intuition with discursive understanding, an intellectual intuition or, what amounts to the same thing, an intuitive understanding, where his relationship to an object is by virtue of (i) its existence being given in the act of this relationship (rather than his being affected in some way by it, with this affectation being presented as a sensible intuition), in a manner that is (ii) direct or unmediated, and total (as it were "all at once"; rather than being mediated by way of presenting a certain ordering of sensible intuitions discursively).

	Kant did believe in the objective reality of the world we experience: justifying such objectivity is the main goal of the first Critique, an effort that culminates with the affirmation of the *principles of pure understanding*. 

	Kant thinks that those principles (e.g. the causality principle) constitute a-priori *and* pure knowledge we necessarily and apodictically are certain of. “These rules of the understanding - writes Kant - are not only a priori true, but the very source of all truth, that

	is, of the accordance of our cognition with objects, and on this ground, they contain the basis of the possibility of experience”.

	This point of view pivots around the idea of the *transcendental*. We actively “inject” a structure into, we actively organise the encounter with, whatever is out there. For some reason that eludes Kant (and everyone else), we are a species that happens to encounter reality in such and such way: a temporal way, a causal way, a mathematical way, an aesthetic way, and so on [for a full list of transcendental conditions of experience see footnote]. Those “ways”, those conditions of experience (the things we “inject”, all of them simultaneously), condition and inform (organise) experience on such a deep level that, from a certain point of view (the point of view of grounding and justifying), they are more important than the things we actually encounter, than the empirical content: they’re *constitutive* of experience, which wouldn’t arise from the empirical without them, at least in the form we know.

	A long paragraph simply to show that the transcendental is both subjective, because that’s how experience is possible for me as a subject, and also objective, since it’s valid for every human being. It’s a form of restricted and mediated objectivity though, if you will, since it might not be valid for different beings and relies on somewhat complex operations that can fail (and in fact we can have dysfunctional mental states with which it is impossible to establish an objective common ground). It emanates from the subject rather than being inherent to the object, and it’s been written that Kant’s objectivity is really inter-subjectivity. But that’s its strength: **the conditions of objective experience don’t depend on an unknowable reality, but on me**, and in the case of the logic conditions of possibility I’m consciously and explicitly aware of what I’m injecting into reality, for example the principle of causality, so I can be absolutely sure of what I’m doing and explicitly prove it to others — hence the necessity of the law. That’s the sense of what is known as Kant’s Copernican revolution.

	[footnote — the full list of transcendental conditions of experience analysed by Kant is: 

	i) the pure forms of intuition, space and time;

	ii) 12 conceptual categories, grouped in 2 mathematical sets (quantity and quality) of 3 concepts each and 2 dynamical sets (relation and modality) of 3 concepts each;

	iii) the aesthetic principle of the reflective power of judgment.]

		Ok, elaborating on mental disorders, given two people, one hallucinating a person, would Kant say that there is a way to show that the person not hallucinating is “objectively” right?
		    Perhaps by using these principles to show that the hallucination is not part of our “ordinary” experience?
		
		Also, on a side note, it is interesting to think about aliens, and if Kant is right, how they might perceive reality entirely different to us. Quite interesting

		* 🟧 **[TurbulentVagus](https://www.reddit.com/user/TurbulentVagus)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-02-16 01:53:41)_

			From a kantian perspective you could say that we are all hallucinating, all the time. We have no means to know what’s *really* out there, the things in themselves. 
			
			If we conceive hallucinations as “perceiving *more* than what’s really there”, every empirical perception is a fundamentally **creative** act of organising sensations into imaginative schemata (held together by concepts, be they determined or indeterminate), which are then compared in the reflective power of judgement to asses just that relationship with concepts. 
			
			Such relationship with concepts, and in turns with language, can be communicated if we assume a Sensus Communis, that is a transcendental faculty of the reflective power of judgement, characterised by an aesthetic principle. The principle according to which we asses, like I said, the relationship between imagination (which organises perception) and understanding *in the particular case at hand* is transcendental, so it’s valid for everyone. 
			
			Consequently, if we assume a theoretical scenario of two subjects, who receive exactly the same sensory data and who posses exactly the same imaginative schemata that embody the same concepts, we can be a priori certain that they will pronounce the same judgment, for instance “that’s an apple”. 
			
			The problem is that 1) sensory data are never exactly the same and 2) imaginative schemata are themselves the result of creative processes and personal experiences, so that concepts have slightly (or grossly sometimes) different meanings for each of us, they all exhibit liminal indeterminacy.
			
			However, problem 2) doesn’t occur when it comes to absolutely basic aspects of experience, the aspects determined by the principles of pure understanding. That’s because they *constitute* experience. You can still have problem number 1): maybe you see double and we don’t agree on the first category of quantity (one or two apples?), but if your sensibility and intuition function properly, we *will* necessary agree at least on the number. 
			
			Except that that’s not true. I never actually face an “object of experience *in general*”, which is the topic of the first critique (as [u/wokeupabug](https://www.reddit.com/user/wokeupabug) legitimately argued in a recent conversation we had). Granted, I must be able to think it, in order to justify the transcendental conditions of experience *in general*, but in the realm of the *empirical use* of reason (the only legitimate one, according to Kant), those conditions are only half of the story. They’re incomplete and need to be integrated with the transcendental and aesthetic principle analysed in the 3rd critique. The problem is that in any real scenario, i. e. in any empirical use, I can’t say “I see an object that is one, whatever object that is” and impose to everyone else the application of the same category of quantity “one”: there is a co-fundamental, an equally transcendental condition that must be fulfilled: that I *actually* perceive something whose empirical schema (as vague as it may be) I can compare with the transcendental schema (temporal rule) of “one” through my reflective judgment. The result of such comparison depends again on how my imagination (the faculty of schemata) organises my sensations, so we still have problem number 2). 
			
			In conclusion, in your scenario nothing can categorically prove or disprove who is hallucinating and who is not. Empirical knowledge is simply a hallucination the majority of people agree upon. The principles of pure understanding are just something we *need* to assume in order to have such hallucinations (be they idiosyncratic or universally accepted) emerge from the contact with reality.

			* 🟦 **[Archer578](https://www.reddit.com/user/Archer578) (OP)** ⬆️ 1 _(2024-02-16 16:17:04)_

				Ok, isn’t “hallucination” a bit more than Kant himself would say? He did not say reality was an illusion or anything like that, so I’m not sure he would agree with the hallucination thing, but IDK.
				
				Also, given your last paragraph, what is the difference between kantian objectivity and intersubjectivity? It doesn’t seem like there is any difference, and yet I thought his whole project was to establish a (relatively) objective reality to “save science” from pure subjectivity. But maybe I am wildly wrong here.
