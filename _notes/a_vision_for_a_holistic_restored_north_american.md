## A Vision for a Holistic Restored North American Ecology

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/17z4rcj/a_vision_for_a_holistic_restored_north_american/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/17z4rcj/a_vision_for_a_holistic_restored_north_american/)

> Hey friends!
> 
> I've been thinking a lot about permaculture, ecological restoration, and environmentalism as a whole. I've taught permaculture courses and I currently work in river restoration professionally.
> 
> Something that really been on my mind lately is that the American environmental movement doesn't really have a cohesive ecological narrative to point to as a holistic goal for our future. I've had the privilege of working and learning from amazing people incredibly knowledgeable about their fields, but everyone seems siloed in their own worlds (which does have its pros) and I don't see anyone presenting a narrative weaving together all disciplines. 
> 
> I'm going to try and outline a few pressure points that I see for ecological restoration, permaculture, and just generally a path towards a vibrant living world. There are some things in this brief outline I can speak to better than others but I don't think someone needs a Ph.D. to understand holistic ecology.  
> 
> I would really love people's feedback and insights. I'm trying to figure out if this is worth fleshing out more into a more polished piece of writing. This is specific to North America, maybe even just the continental US as that's what I'm familiar with. I'd love other people in other parts of the world to expand this dialogue into their regions.
> 
> **TLDR**
> 
> Beaver restoration, dam removal, oyster restoration, urine diversion, silvopasture, rotational grazing, lawn to meadow, and prescribed fire are the foundation of a resilient and abundant America. It is imperative we bring these fields together and start championing a cohesive ecological narrative. Our lands are too big and the problem is too severe to leave to the government and NGOs. We all need to be champions of our ecology, get our communities involved, and start healing lands for the benefit of all life on Earth.
> 
> 
> Envision our home in 1491, pre-European contact. Beaver wetlands neighbor broad oak savannahs where bison, small game, innumerable nuts, ribes, and medicinals carpet the deep healthy soil. Rivers teeming with fish, bivalves, and flocks of birds that block out the sun. The smell of smoke in early spring as the cycle begins again. Now picture the world we can make by 2100. Every piece that I just named is scalable and cheap. Nothing can compare to the biodiversity, resilience, and abundance that these cohesive ecological holons can create. Humans have an immense capacity for destruction and an immense capacity for abundance and diversity. We have more power at our disposal than ever before. We can create a more beautiful world today.

> **The Myth of Disparate Issues**

> 
> **Our Waters**
> 
> * **Beaver Restoration**
> There used to be somewhere between 300-600 million beavers in the US. There are now about 15 million. Estimates vary but beaver meadows used to occupy around 225,000 square miles 0 about the size of Nevada and Arizona combined. Considering that the biodiversity of beaver ponds is comparable to rainforests and coral reefs, their importance is clear immediately. Their near extirpation from our rivers has had devastating consequences on erosion, loss of fish, mammal, and insect habitat, flood and drought mitigation, and fire resilience. Most rivers are now too incised for beavers to move back in. Beaver Dam Analogues (BDAs) are man-made structures that mimic beaver dams. They are made by pounding posts across a stream and making a dam out of mid and brushy material. This starts ponding water, recharging groundwater, aggrading sediment to reconnect floodplains, and creating conditions for riparian vegetation. Beavers can now move in. Beavers's ability to sink, spread, and slow water should set off alarm bells in any permaculturists mind. In the arid west, beaver restoration is especially important. There is also an incredible amount of non-lethal methods to co-exist with beavers around human infrastructure More info on beavers and BDAs here: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63ji0XFPwBQ) (https://www.beaverinstitute.org/learn-about-beavers/whybeavers/) (https://www.beaverinstitute.org/get-beaver-help/blocked-road-culverts-and-drains/) (https://www.beaverinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/The-Beaver-Restoration-Guidebook-v2.01-1.pdf)
> 
> 
> * **Removing Dams**
> This should need less explanation. The majority of large bodies of water in the US are dammed, most of them many times. This has disastrous effects on fish populations, riparian vegetation, migratory birds, and upstream and downstream sediment movement. There's a reason estuaries are one of the most biodiverse ecotones in the world. Dams restrict the ability for nutrients to flow freely up and down rivers. The majority of water impounded by dams goes to subsidize highly destructive monoculture agriculture. I'm going to assume most people here are familiar with that so I won't expound on the disaster of monocultures, fertilizer, and pesticides. Removing dams will restore the life flow from the seas to the inlands. There are some incredible results coming from the Elwha Dam removal and the Klamath Dams are coming down as we speak. It is remarkably exciting. 
> 
> 
> * **Oyster Restoration**
> Oysters are the keystone species of most brackish shallow water areas. Before it was dredged for commerce, New York's Hudson Bay was about 350 square miles of shallow estuaries, supporting millions (if not billions) of oysters, fish, birds, and crustaceans. Oysters filter a remarkable amount of water (up to 50 gallons per day PER OYSTER); here is a quick time-lapse of that (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N39nPt7k3p0). Now imagine that times 100 million in the Hudson Bay alone. The same fate has befallen the Chesapeake, San Francisco Bay, and many other remarkable estuaries around the US. As they grow on each other, they create dynamic three-dimensional structure which creates niches for many aquatic species. The role oysters are, and will continue to play, in cleaning our waters cannot be understated. There are some amazing projects restoring oysters as we speak (https://www.billionoysterproject.org/). Just like BDAs, oyster restoration is cheap and scalable. 
> 
> 
> * **Mass Scale Urine Diversion**
> Human urine is a near-perfect fertilizer for plants. While this might sound strange to some, this should really not be a surprise. Almost all of us here garden with some sort of animal manure as fertilizers and we are no different. Our coevolution with trees should make this rather clear. Urine belongs on plants, not in our waters. Many city's infrastructures are outdated and pump millions of gallons of raw sewage into our waterways. Instead, we need to divert urine (and probably eventually poop) from the waste stream. High nutrient loads in water are what lead to dead zones and algae blooms. This perfect and ubiquitous 'waste stream' dovetails perfectly into a silvopasture perennial future. Check out the Rich Earth Institute for more information: https://richearthinstitute.org/ 
> 
> **Our Lands**
> 
> * **Silvopasture and Rotational Grazing**
> Silvopasture is the intentional integration of trees and grazing animals (silv-tree, pasture-pasture). Rotational grazing is the process of managing ruminants like buffalo and bison would naturally behave. Large herds would come to a grassland, eat it down, poop, pee, and sometimes die, and then move on and let the grass recover. This process was why the American prairies had topsoil 200+ feet deep in some areas. Trees sequester carbon, add a layer of structural diversity, add organic matter to the soil, provide shade for happier and healthier animals, and ideally are of high value for forage and fruit. Trees like Honey Locusts, Hickories, Chestnuts, Mulberries, Persimmons, and Oaks to name a few, present incredible opportunities for perennial carbs, fats, and oils.  Improved cultivars easily outperform yields of corn and grain (replaced by chestnut) and rapeseed (replaced by Bitternut Hickory), not to mention finishing animals on an incredible diet of grass, Persimmons, Honey Locusts, Chestnuts, Mulberries, and Hazelnuts. The future is tasty! Most people know that good soils high in organic matter hold incredible amounts of water. I want you to reimagine what the West might look like with healthy grazing lands as a huge sponge of water combined with large beaver populations as another huge sponge. The continental US used to be a much wetter and more resilient place. (https://treesforgraziers.com/)
> 
> * **Prescribed/Cultural burns**
> I like to half-joke that everything in the US used to be either on fire or underwater in a beaver meadow. While we tend to think of fires mostly in the west, the reality is that most of the US was regularly burned, all the way deep into Maine and down to Florida. Let us also not forget that fire played a huge role in prairie health as well. What a stroke of luck it is that most nut trees (oaks, hickories, chestnuts, hazelnuts, etc) are fire-resistant. Pretty quickly we can see how fire, silvopasture, and ruminants came together to create an incredible amount of biomass for insects, mammals, birds, and humans. The myth of the primeval old-growth forest of New England is dispelled by every early account of settlers describing the area as 'park-like' with overstories of nut trees. Do you want an actual food forest? Then burn it during the cool season. 40-60% canopy cover provides open structure and enough light getting to the ground to promote forbe and shrub growth. Want a low-maintenance medicinal herb garden? Check out how many prairie plants are medicinal and again you'll see how fire is key for human and ecological health. By the time most Europeans got to the US, disease and brutal colonialization had already destroyed 90-99% of most indigenous inhabitants, and fire had been absent for a hundred-plus years - most people saw an overgrown, overcrowded forest. The role that indigenous peoples played in actively creating their landscape makes me feel like we need a better term than 'hunter-gatherer'. I believe that term implies a passive luck of stumbling upon food, when in reality they were and are a crucial piece of a diverse and resilient landscape. The best I've come up with is 'hunter-cultivator' or 'hunter-landshaper'. I'd love to hear other suggestions. Here is an incredible in-depth article about the brilliance of regularly burning our landscapes: https://www.daviesand.com/Papers/Tree_Crops/Indian_Agroforestry/ 
> 
> * **Lawn to Meadow/Prairie**
> There are 40 million acres of lawn in the US alone. These tend to use insane amounts of water, fertilizer, and herbicide to create an ecological desert. And yet we can't figure out why insect populations are dropping... Converting even half of that acreage to annual and perennial plants would do an immense amount to support the insects and the food webs that rely on them. Lawn to meadow isn't explicitly different than the conversation on prescribed burns or silvopasture, but it occupies so much land that I wanted to name it explicitly. 
> 
> Envision our home in 1491, pre-contact. Beaver wetlands neighbor broad oak savannahs where bison, small game, innumerable nuts, ribes, and medicinals carpet the deep healthy soil. Rivers teeming with fish, bivalves, and flocks of birds that block out the sun. The smell of smoke in early spring as the cycle begins again. Now picture the world we can make by 2100.

	Beautiful vision and great job whittling it down to some core principles that are universally applicable across the diverse biomes of the continent.

	The largest hang up that I see to this scale of restoration is the need for multiple private land owners to work in concert for many of them to work. Or, in some places, the need for many many more people to be brought back onto landscapes that are currently managed by a few people with large equipment. Both of these things run in stark contrast to deeply help cultural beliefs, especially in rural parts of the country. 

	I'm not sure what the path to overcoming those cultural biases are. But if we can, you've laid out a great path back to ecological wealth

		Couldn't agree more. There are many obstacles in the way. 
		
		I think what I'm trying to do is lay out a 'north star' of sorts that we can point to. I worry that the environmental movement doesn't have a direction. My hope is that with something we can point to (this vision of sorts), we can build communities around this narrative.
		
		Absolutely we have deeply held cultural beliefs standing in our way

			Yeah getting the many arms of the environmental movement pointed in at least some semblance of the same direction would be a great thing.
			
			And a narrative like you've laid out is exactly what is needed to coalesce disparate groups around a shared objective

	Seriously great post, so much info - thank you for sharing. I see from your profile that you're in the PNW...I'm in Portland - do you happen to have any recommendations for permaculture courses or education that I could access locally?  

	I want to dive into the world of permaculture and sustainable living but I feel like I need a proper education first

	* 🟨 **[millerw](https://www.reddit.com/user/millerw) (OP)** ⬆️ 4 _(2023-11-19 18:38:08)_

		Thanks so much! 
		
		I'm away from the PNW probably for good but Oregon State University has great resources. I could be wrong but I think they have a free PDC? Andrew Millison has a lot of great videos. Learning in person is the best option though. Portland is a hub and there are lots of workshops going on around town. 
		
		One of the best things you can do is just start trying things. Learn to garden, see if there is a farm you can work on, get better at plant ID, and grow some mushrooms. It is a lifetime of learning which can be exciting and overwhelming. I learned the most by doing things and now that I have a good base, it's a lot easier to learn from reading and watching videos. Some things just need to be experienced. You'll never get to a point where it's like 'ah I've finally learned enough its time to start living sustainably'. Learn as you go. Its really the only way to do it. Its cliche but I've learned a ton from my mistakes as they are great teaching moments.

		Thanks! And yes I totally agree. It was hard to write this because there is soooo much nuance to these conversations but at the same time, I wanted to paint with a broad brush a widely applicable ecological framework. I felt like most of these are applicable to most places. Hard not to go into the weeds with these things.

		* 🟧 **[Whocket_Pale](https://www.reddit.com/user/Whocket_Pale)** ⬆️ 3 _(2023-11-19 16:37:30)_

			Maybe the solution is to go wide-angle, i.e. to consider how you could frame a narrative so as to be applicable anywhere on Earth. How would you characterize a universal "beaver" for instance?

			* 🟦 **[millerw](https://www.reddit.com/user/millerw) (OP)** ⬆️ 4 _(2023-11-19 16:56:05)_

				Yeah, it's hard to balance breadth vs depth. I don't have the knowledge or experience to speak on other climates and ecologies so I didn't want to. But that's exactly the reason I'd love people from other bioregions to chip in with similar analyses that are appropriate for their climates. Too much depth and its not widely applicable, too much breadth and it isn't applicable. The point of specific ecologies and specific climates is that nothing is universal. I fear I've already been too broad in the US alone, and the rest of the world is huge and incredibly diverse. My goal isn't to make too broad of claims for the world.

	I'll be brief - I'm typing with thumbs now, but I can respond to questions in more detail later from a computer. 

	Great post - thanks for compiling! Here are quick reactions from a person with professional experience in environmental communications: 

	- it all depends on your audience. It's difficult for me to see the audience you intend this to impact, and the goal/action you have in mind for that audience. (These two things are dictated by your overall goal, which is also unclear to me.) Environmental movement and politics people will say, 'yeah, but this doesn't address the politics and isn't for lay public consumption.' And, they're right: this isn't a good piece for the lay public. This appears geared toward academic, eco restoration, and permi types - which leads to preaching to the choir - so what is the goal here?

	- I've seen you say several times that, 'the environmental movement doesn't has a clean and uniform narrative.' Indeed, but there are both good and bad reasons why that is true. This piece doesn't incorporate those realities - it appears to request that the message unites around an eco-restoration frame, and there are reasons this is a tough slog. Be cautious to avoid 'blaming the victim' in remarks about the movement - there are emergent and powerful reasons things are how we find them today. Much more could be said here to create a more effective message - depending on the goal, of course. 

	- Developing all these tactics and even referencing 1492 and the pre-columbian Americas without noting and addressing Native American preeminence, approaches, and due credit will be particularly galling and counter-productuve to a huge portion of any of the audiences we've considered so far. Just a note...

	The political environmental movement - and the larger movement to save ecology - is an astoundingly complex effort with many of our brightest minds focused on its success; it takes a great deal of humility and understanding to accept the fact that if things are broken right now there is actually quite a bit of good reason this is the case. Pulling together a unifying message is a noble endeavor, but also a task so enormous and complex it simply lives outside of the scope of awareness for almost anyone - it's an effort to be approached with caution and a healthy regard for our tendency toward hubris. 

	I love this stuff and I've spent my adult life on it, so I hope you have developing questions!  (And please don't take offense to my blunt and hasty thumb typing! ) cheers

		Thanks for taking the time to comment!
		
		No offense taken I appreciate the different perspective :).
		
		As far as my audience, I am not entirely sure. I posted this to a permaculture community because I feel like we have more shared assumptions about what it means to be human on earth - actively involved in our ecologies as keystone species. I feel like most (many?) people are still of the belief that the best thing we can do for nature is to leave it alone. I didn't want to cover those assumptions in this post, but I would like to throw this out to some other communities to hear their thoughts too. As far as preaching to the choir, I agree to an extent but I think my motivation for this was that I hadn't seen a wide-ranging vision like this. I was hoping this could fill a need. 
		
		I didn't mean to 'blame the victim' as you mentioned. I really appreciate you mentioning that because I don't want to come off that way. Clearly, there are remarkable social, political, and economic factors barring people from a better future.
		
		I cited a few articles on indigenous agroforestry practices and I appreciate the feedback that I didn't do enough to explicitly name it. I could talk forever about the brilliance of cultural burning but I tried to keep it brief. If I continue to work on this I'll definitely try to tie that together more. I mention 1491 as a time when the co-evolved relationships were more intact, with indigenous communities playing an incredible role as a keystone species and I tried to touch more on how their stewardship is deserving of a far better name than 'hunter-gatherers'. It is definitely something I want to continue learning more about. 
		
		Thanks again for all your ideas! I hope to incorporate them into future edits :)

	I feel like this is a great model and models are useful for learning. But if applied like you imply it turns into dogma. Bureaucracy loves dogma (oftentimes they call it policy). Have you read Lyla Junes PhD thesis on human agriculture pre-colonialism? IMO the problem is the separation we are living from nature. The separation is the disease which leads to the poor ecosystem health. Lyla does a great illustration showing how humans are part of the ecosystem and what is capable in that dimension.

	I don't believe we can return land to pre-colonial states and still sustain the current North American population without importing even more food, burning even more fossil fuels, and leaning on other non-sustainable resources.  I read in Overshoot by William Catton that when the White European settlers arrived on the shores of North America, what appeared to them as "empty" land was in fact already supporting to its carrying capacity the humans and other animals that occupied this land.  That left an impression on me.  Now I'm pretty convinced that sustainable living given that we are in a state of overshoot with our human population right now looks potentially very different from pre-modern states.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Gives us opportunity to use our smarts to design a sustainable future.

		I agree. I don't necessarily think that aiming for pre-colonialism ecology is or should be the goal. I was hoping to touch on the broader co-evolved relationships that define this country and how and why some of them are interrupted. It is an interesting thought experiement (can't remember where I heard this) but someone postulated that there was probably more 'human food' in the US pre colonization. Around 60 million cows now but there used to be around 50 million bison. Tons of corn and soy now but the east used to be covered in perennial nuts that are kinda equivalent. Not to mention the abundant small game and healthy fish and bivalve populations. Not worth actually trying to compute it but just as a food for thought, there might've been more food years ago despite the amount of fossil fuels we use for food production now.

	Thanks for the vision.  I have a follow up Q on oyster (and seagrass) restoration. 

	Can anyone share info on oyster and seagrass restoration in conjunction with a mitigation bank or conservation bank?   For example, does the NYC Billion Oyster Project generate mitigation credits from the oyter reefs they have restored/created?

	I am brand new to this topic.  I am a semi-retired tax lawyer, thus, way out of my field talking oyster farming, restoration, etc. But, I am interested in improving conditions in my area.  Our oysters and seagrass beds collaopsed over the last 30-40 years.  Maybe the private sector/free markets can help in the restoration.

		Sounds like this topic is close to home for you! I'd look into what industries happen in your bay/estuary or up the tributaries that feed the ocean. Usually some combination of pollution and overfishing wreck coastal ecosystems. Best wishes to heal your area!

	I keep hearing people repeat this but so far nobody can back it up. Yes, it's true that there are 40 million acres of lawn in the US. But the vast majority of folks I've known in the 3 different states I've lived in don't irrigate, fertilize, or use herbicides on their lawn. Their lawns are more weeds than grass.

	Outside of suburban planned developments with strict HOAs, most people don't have the lush green desert lawns that you're talking about.

	Maybe a better metric for how much fertilizer, insecticide, and herbicide used in the US is to look at the annual sales of those products instead of just guessing based on how many acres of lawn there are.

		Of course, the figures will differ depending on where you look. The main point is that we put so much time, effort, and resources into our lawns. Lawncare is a multi-billion dollar industry and we've fallen for it. The article I posted estimates it is a 76-billion-dollar industry. Of course, some of that goes into lawn mowers and not herbicide, but they are still an ecological nightmare.
