## We must continue to bear witness & unite as a collective in our shared humanity to break the systems that continue to allow this to be the norm. Class consciousness is calling to remind us the 99% that “We are not free, until everyone is free!”

Video transcript:
	There's not a damn word that I would believe coming out of Biden's cacole.
	Not a damn word.
	Telling BBO we need to have a come to Jesus moment,
	he laughs knowing he's on a hot mic because he doesn't believe in Jesus or a God
	or even the United States of America.
	Look at who he was as a senator, the only one who wanted the war in Lebanon
	and in front of Began said he himself would kill women and children
	and he stuck to his word, didn't he?
	So there's not a damn word out of his decrepit decaying white pasty mouth
	that I would ever believe in.

It's very important for us to pay close attention to the countries that are in the same technology.
Records everything on your camera, everything in your microphone sends it to a database.
Governments have access to espionage technology that can from a few hundred feet away shoot a laser
record the small frequencies through a wall, get that data back and analyze that data and eavesdrop.
Technology has a decade alone in AI and everything that comes with intelligence has excelled
dramatically. Whatever you think is private most likely isn't. Be mindful of that while
navigating life. At least that's what any person that I work with interests in safety,
litigation, intelligence would tell you.

Video transcript:
	What we're seeing right here is machinery being brought in to make an American port to bring
	in aid.
	We say this is calm as humanly possible.
	If these can get in by land, we do not need to build a port.
	Use these to take people out from the rubble and fuck your stupid port.
	Stop it.
	This is insanity.
	This is crazy.
	We do not need to build a port.
	If the stuff to build the port can get in by land, why do we need to build the port?
