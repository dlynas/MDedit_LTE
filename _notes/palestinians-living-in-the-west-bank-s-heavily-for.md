## Palestinians living in the West Bank's heavily fortified and monitored H2 district in Hebron have been under one of its longest and strictest lockdowns ever since the start of the conflict. Some 39,000 Palestinians and around 900 extremist Israeli settlers live in H2. Palestinians have largely been barred from leaving their homes, except during very brief windows, with Israeli soldiers forcing them back inside at gunpoint. 

Israeli military and settler attacks have killed at least 200 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7th.
