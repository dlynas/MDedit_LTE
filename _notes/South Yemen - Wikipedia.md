South Yemen's origins can be traced to 1874 with the creation of the British [Colony of Aden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Aden "Colony of Aden") and the [Aden Protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden_Protectorate "Aden Protectorate"), which consisted of two-thirds of present-day Yemen. Prior to 1937, what was to become the Colony of Aden had been governed as a part of British India, originally as the [Aden Settlement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden_Settlement "Aden Settlement") subordinate to the Bombay Presidency and then as a Chief Commissioner's province. After the collapse of Aden Protectorate, [a state of emergency](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden_Emergency "Aden Emergency") was declared in 1963, when the [National Liberation Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(South_Yemen) "National Liberation Front (South Yemen)") (NLF) and the [Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Occupied_South_Yemen "Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen") (FLOSY) rebelled against the British rule.

The [Federation of South Arabia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_South_Arabia "Federation of South Arabia") and the [Protectorate of South Arabia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate_of_South_Arabia "Protectorate of South Arabia") were overthrown to become the **People's Republic of South Yemen** on 30 November 1967, which later changed its name to the **People's Democratic Republic of Yemen** after the reforms that happened a year from the [Corrective Move](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_Move "Corrective Move"), with it becoming a [Marxist–Leninist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist "Marxist–Leninist") [one-party state](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state "One-party state") in 1969 and was supported by [Cuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba "Cuba"), [East Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany"), [North Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea "North Korea") and the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"). Despite its efforts to bring stability into the region, it was involved in a [brief civil war in 1986](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen_Civil_War "South Yemen Civil War"). South Yemen was unified with the [Yemen Arab Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen_Arab_Republic "Yemen Arab Republic"), commonly known as "North Yemen", on 22 May 1990 to form the present-day [Republic of Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Yemen "Republic of Yemen").

## History [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")

### British rule and decolonization [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: British rule and decolonization")

In 1838, [Sultan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan "Sultan") Muhsin Bin Fadl of the state of [Lahej](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Lahej "Sultanate of Lahej") ceded 194 km<sup>2</sup> (75 sq mi) of [Aden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden_Province "Aden Province") to the [British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire "British Empire"). On 19 January 1839, the [British East India Company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company "British East India Company") landed [Royal Marines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines "Royal Marines") at [Aden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden "Aden") to occupy the territory and stop attacks by [pirates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate "Pirate") against [British shipping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Navy_(United_Kingdom) "Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)") to India making Aden a part of British colonial rule from 1839 until 1937. In the 1920s, the British began expanding and annexing the multiple sheikhdoms surrounding Aden under the claim of [protecting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_protectorate "British protectorate") them.<sup id="cite_ref-Online._Encyclopædia_Britannica_Inc_2013_12-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Online._Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Inc_2013-12">[7]</a></sup> This was more a precautionary measure to prevent the [Yemeni imams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Yemen "Kingdom of Yemen") from storming Aden than a desire to annex the small sheikhdoms to the empire in the mid-1950s.<sup id="cite_ref-Online._Encyclopædia_Britannica_Inc_2013_12-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Online._Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Inc_2013-12">[7]</a></sup> On the twentieth,<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Dates and numbers"><span title="The time period mentioned near this tag is ambiguous.

By 1965, four sheikhdoms out of twenty-one had joined the union.<sup id="cite_ref-Online._Encyclopædia_Britannica_Inc_20134_17-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Online._Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_Inc_20134-17">[12]</a></sup> The [Hadhramaut](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadhramaut "Hadhramaut") sultanates refused to join either federation. Several resistance movements emerged, such as the [National Liberation Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Yemen) "National Liberation Front (Yemen)"), which killed British High Commissioner [Kennedy Trevskis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Trevaskis "Kennedy Trevaskis") on December 10, 1963, and sparked the [October 14 Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_14_Revolution "October 14 Revolution").<sup id="cite_ref-Stephen_W._Day_p.392_18-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Stephen_W._Day_p.392-18">[13]</a></sup> They were influenced by the [September 26 Revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_26_Revolution "September 26 Revolution") and the [Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Occupied_South_Yemen "Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen"). The British had announced that they would withdraw in 1968. The National Liberation Front and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen appeared. In the sixties of the twentieth century. Support for the National Liberation Front came from the countryside of [Radfan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radfan "Radfan"), [Yafa](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yafa%27a "Yafa'a"), and [Ad-Dali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhale "Dhale"), while most of the supporters of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen were from Aden. This is because tribal affiliations played a major role in attracting supporters.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-19">[14]</a></sup> The leaders of the National Liberation Front came from within the protected sheikhdoms and were not supported by the Egyptians at first, while the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen ran its operations from Aden and received support from [Gamal Abdel Nasser](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser "Gamal Abdel Nasser"), which made it appear as a follower. To the Egyptians promoting Nasser’s agendas inside the country, the operations of these factions against the British were known as the October 14 Revolution. The British tried to reach a compromise with these groups and found themselves waging a war on two fronts, trying to thwart the Republic in the north and the anti-English factions in the south.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-20">[15]</a></sup>

By 1965, most of the western protectorates had fallen to the National Liberation Front. As for Hadhramaut, it seemed calm until 1966 because the English presence there was less than its counterpart in the western protectorates.<sup id="cite_ref-Noel_Brehony_p.282_21-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Noel_Brehony_p.282-21">[16]</a></sup> [Ali Salem al-Baidh](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Salem_al_Beidh "Ali Salem al Beidh") and [Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haidar_Abu_Bakr_al-Attas "Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas") joined the National Liberation Front in Hadhramaut and prevented the sultans of the [Kathiri Sultanate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathiri "Kathiri") and the [Qu'aiti Sultanate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%27aiti "Qu'aiti") from entering the country, but allowed the Sultan of the [Mahra Sultanate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahra_Sultanate "Mahra Sultanate") due to his old age.<sup id="cite_ref-Noel_Brehony_p.28_22-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Noel_Brehony_p.28-22">[17]</a></sup> The commander of the Hadhrami Bedouin Legion was killed by one of his men in the same year, and Ali Salem Al-Beidh and Muhammad Salem Akash played a major role in gathering supporters in favor of the National Liberation Front, taking advantage of the near absence of the English presence in al-Mahra.<sup id="cite_ref-Noel_Brehony_p.29_23-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Noel_Brehony_p.29-23">[18]</a></sup>

[Qahtan Al-Shaabi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qahtan_Muhammad_al-Shaabi "Qahtan Muhammad al-Shaabi") was the only person the British knew because he was an agricultural engineer in his city of Lahij. When the British tried to negotiate with the National Liberation Front, Qahtan demanded immediate withdrawal and recognition of the legitimacy of his government, and that the British government provide aid double what it proposed to the union, and that all the islands associated with the Aden Protectorate be part of the new state. While the British demands were an orderly handover to the authorities, and that the new state not interfere in the affairs of any country in the Arabian Peninsula.<sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-24">[19]</a></sup> The British were surprised by the presence of people they thought were loyal to them alongside the popular Qahtan. The NLF was invited to the Geneva Talks to sign the independence agreement with the British. During its occupation of [Aden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden "Aden"), the British had signed several treaties of protection with the local sheikhdoms and emirates of the Federation of South Arabia; however, these parties were excluded from the talks, and thus the agreement stated \[...the handover of the territory of South Arabia to the (Yemeni) NLF...\]. Southern Yemen became independent as the People's Republic of South Yemen on 30 November 1967, and the National Liberation Front consolidated its control in the country. On 14 December 1967, the PDRY was admitted into the [United Nations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") as a member state. the British announced that they would withdraw from 1968, which sparked the battles between the National Liberation Front and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen to monopolize the right to self-determination after the British left.<sup id="cite_ref-Noel_Brehony_p.292_25-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Noel_Brehony_p.292-25">[20]</a></sup>

The National Liberation Front had the upper hand at the expense of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, whose members were divided between joining the National Front or leaving for North Yemen.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-26">[21]</a></sup> Abdullah Al-Asanj and Muhammad Basindwa left for North Yemen. The last British soldier left Aden on November 30, 1967, and the sheikhdoms of the Eastern Protectorate in Hadhramaut were annexed to the new country. The lands of South Yemen are rugged and barren, a fact that played a role in the social, cultural and economic development of the south, unlike the northern regions of Yemen. Their population in 1967 did not exceed two million people, while northern Yemen exceeded six million.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-27">[22]</a></sup> Most of the population of the south was concentrated in the western regions of [Lahj](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahij "Lahij") and its environs, and these alone constituted more than 60% of the population, 10% were nomads. Qahtan al-Shaabi assumed the presidency of a state that had never existed before, with a collapsed economy.<sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-28">[23]</a></sup> Civilian workers and businessmen left, British support stopped, and the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 reduced the number of ships crossing Aden by 75%.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-29">[24]</a></sup>

The National Liberation Front had approximately 4,000 members, a small number of university-educated leaders, and all of them, without exception, had no experience in government.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-30">[25]</a></sup> The front was divided into two right-wing and left-wing sections. The right-wingers and their popular leader, Qahtan, did not want to make major changes in the prevailing social and economic structure and took a conservative stance toward “liberating all Arab lands from colonialism, supporting the resistance of the Palestinian people, and supporting socialist regimes around the world to resist imperialism and colonial forces in the Third World.”<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-31">[26]</a></sup> The leftist section of the Liberation Front was also promoting and opposed the establishment of popular forces and proposals to nationalize lands, and they were not preoccupied with the struggle of social classes. Qahtan wanted the continuation of existing institutions and their development.<sup id="cite_ref-Fred_Haliday_p.24_32-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Fred_Haliday_p.24-32">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-33">[28]</a></sup> The leftist section “wanted a social and economic transformation that would serve the broad segment of the working people instead of the wealthy minority,” as they put it.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-34">[29]</a></sup> on March 20 1968, Qahtan dismissed all leftist leaders from the government and party membership and was able to put down a rebellion led by leftist factions in the army in May of the same year.<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-35">[30]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Fred_Haliday_p.242_36-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Fred_Haliday_p.242-36">[31]</a></sup> On another level, in the months of July, August and December of 1968, the popular Qahtan faced new rebellions from leftist parties because all Arab countries welcomed the front. The National Liberation Front received a cold reception, as regimes like Egypt wanted to merge the National Front with the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen.<sup id="cite_ref-:5_37-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:5-37">[32]</a></sup> The leftist section was more numerous than the supporters of the popular Qahtan, and they wanted a regime that would lead the masses and face the great challenges facing the new state, the most important of which was the bankruptcy of the treasury.<sup id="cite_ref-:5_37-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:5-37">[32]</a></sup>

On December 11, 1967, the lands of “feudal symbols and British agents” were confiscated, and the state was divided into six governorates.<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-38">[33]</a></sup> The aim of the move was to end tribal aspects in the state and ignore the tribal borders between the defunct sheikhdoms.<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-39">[34]</a></sup> On June 16, 1969, Qahtan fired Interior Minister Muhammad Ali Haitham, but the latter withdrew his ties to With the tribes and the army, he was able to ally himself with Muhammad Saleh Al-Awlaki, and they reassembled the leftist forces that had been dispersed by President Qahtan Al-Shaabi.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-40">[35]</a></sup> They were able to arrest him and place him under house arrest.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-41">[36]</a></sup>

On June 22 1969, a radical [Marxist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist "Marxist") wing of the NLF formed a presidential committee of five people, Salem Rabie Ali, who became president, Muhammad Saleh Al-Awlaki, Ali Antar, Abdel Fattah Ismail, and Muhammad Ali Haitham, who became prime minister.<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-42">[37]</a></sup> they gained power in an event known as the [Corrective Move](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_Move "Corrective Move").

This group took an extreme leftist line and declared its support for the Palestinians and the Dhofar Revolution. West Germany severed its relationship with the state due to its recognition of East Germany. The United States also severed its relationship in October 1969. The new powers issued a new constitution, nationalized foreign banks and insurance companies, and changed the name of the state to The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in line with the Marxist-Leninist approach they followed. A centrally planned economy was established.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-44">[39]</a></sup>The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen established close ties with the [Soviet Union](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"), the [German Democratic Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Democratic_Republic "German Democratic Republic"), [Cuba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba "Cuba"), and the [Palestinian Liberation Organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization "Palestine Liberation Organization").

However, these plans were put on hold in 1979, as the PDRY funded Red rebels in the [YAR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen_Arab_Republic "Yemen Arab Republic"), and war was only prevented by an [Arab League](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League "Arab League") intervention.

### Reforms and attempts for unification [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Reforms and attempts for unification")

Against the background of the [perestroika](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika "Perestroika") in the [USSR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR "USSR"), the main backer of the PDRY, [political reforms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_movement "Reform movement") were started in the late 1980s. [Political prisoners](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoners "Political prisoners") were released, political parties were formed, and the system of justice was reckoned to be more equitable than in the North. In May 1988, the [YAR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAR "YAR") and PDRY governments came to an understanding that considerably reduced tensions, including agreement to renew discussions concerning unification, to establish a joint oil exploration area along their undefined border, to demilitarise the border, and to allow Yemenis unrestricted border passage on the basis of only a national identification card. In November 1989, after returning from the [Soviet–Afghan War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War "Soviet–Afghan War"), [Osama bin Laden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden "Osama bin Laden") offered to send the newly formed [al-Qaeda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda "Al-Qaeda") to overthrow the South Yemeni government on behalf of [Saudi Arabia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia"), but Prince [Turki bin Faisal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turki_bin_Faisal_Al_Saud "Turki bin Faisal Al Saud") found the plan reckless and declined.<sup id="cite_ref-59"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-59">[54]</a></sup> In 1990, the parties reached a full agreement on [joint governing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condominium_(international_law) "Condominium (international law)") of Yemen, and the countries were effectively merged as [Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Yemen "Republic of Yemen").<sup id="cite_ref-60"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-60">[55]</a></sup>

### Government [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Government")

The legislative body, the [Supreme People's Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_People%27s_Council_(South_Yemen) "Supreme People's Council (South Yemen)"), was elected by the people for a period of five years. The collective head of state, also known as the Presidium of the Supreme People's Council, was elected by the Supreme People's Council for a period of five years as well.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_63-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:4-63">[58]</a></sup>

The executive body was known as the Council of Ministers, and was formed by the Supreme People's Council. Local representative bodies were the people's councils, and their decisions were taken into account when the members of the Supreme People's Council were governing. Local executive bodies were the executive bureaus of the people's councils.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_63-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:4-63">[58]</a></sup>

### Foreign relations [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Foreign relations")

The only avowedly [Marxist–Leninist nation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state "Communist state") in the Middle East, South Yemen received significant [foreign aid](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_aid "Foreign aid") and [other assistance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMECON "COMECON") from the [USSR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union")<sup id="cite_ref-64"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-64">[59]</a></sup> and [East Germany](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany"), which stationed several hundred officers of the [Stasi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi "Stasi") in the country to train the nation's [secret police](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_police "Secret police") and establish another [arms trafficking](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_trafficking "Arms trafficking") route to [Palestine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region) "Palestine (region)").<sup id="cite_ref-65"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-65">[60]</a></sup> The East Germans did not leave until 1990, when the Yemeni government declined to pay their salaries which had been terminated with the [dissolution of the Stasi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi#Fall_of_the_Soviet_Union "Stasi") during [German reunification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification "German reunification").<sup id="cite_ref-66"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-66">[61]</a></sup>

Relations between South Yemen and several of nearby states were poor. [Saudi Arabia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia%E2%80%93Yemen_relations "Saudi Arabia–Yemen relations") only established diplomatic relations in 1976, initially hosting pro-British exiles and supporting armed clashes in the border regions of South Yemen. [Relations with Oman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman%E2%80%93Yemen_relations "Oman–Yemen relations") declined through the 1970s as the South Yemeni government supported the insurgent Marxist [Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Oman "Popular Front for the Liberation of Oman") (PFLO). Relations with [Ba'athist Iraq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba%27athist_Iraq "Ba'athist Iraq") were also low, as South Yemen offered asylum to a number of [Iraqi communists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Communist_Party "Iraqi Communist Party").<sup id="cite_ref-Lackner_2017_67-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Lackner_2017-67">[62]</a></sup>

The [Supreme People's Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_People%27s_Council_(South_Yemen) "Supreme People's Council (South Yemen)") was appointed by the General Command of the [National Liberation Front](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(South_Yemen) "National Liberation Front (South Yemen)") in 1971.

In Aden, there was a structured judicial system with a [supreme court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court "Supreme court").

### Living standards [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Living standards")

In 1976, the [South Yemen national football team](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen_national_football_team "South Yemen national football team") participated in the [AFC Asian Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Asian_Cup "AFC Asian Cup"), where the team lost to [Iraq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_national_football_team "Iraq national football team") 1–0 and to [Iran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_national_football_team "Iran national football team") 8–0. They entered their only [World Cup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup "FIFA World Cup") qualification campaign in [1986](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(AFC) "1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)") and were knocked out in the first round by [Bahrain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain_national_football_team "Bahrain national football team"). On 2 September 1965, South Yemen played their first international match against the [United Arab Republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_national_football_team "Egypt national football team"), to whom they lost 14–0. On 5 November 1989, South Yemen played its last international match against [Guinea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_national_football_team "Guinea national football team"), to whom they lost 1–0. The team stopped playing when the North and South united in 1990 to form the [modern state of Yemen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen "Yemen").

In 1988, the [South Yemen Olympic team](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen_at_the_1988_Summer_Olympics "South Yemen at the 1988 Summer Olympics") made its debut in the [Summer Olympics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Summer_Olympics "1988 Summer Olympics") in [Seoul](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul "Seoul"). Sending only eight athletes, the country won no medals. This was the only time the country went to the Olympics until [unification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen_unification "Yemen unification") in 1990.

### Women's rights [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Women's rights")

Women's rights under the socialist government were considered the best in the region. Women became legally equal to men and were encouraged to work in public; polygamy, child marriage, and arranged marriage were all banned; and equal rights in divorce received legal sanction.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_70-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:0-70">[65]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:1_71-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:1-71">[66]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-72"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-72">[67]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-73"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-73">[68]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-74"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-74">[69]</a></sup>

## Administrative divisions [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Administrative divisions")

Following independence, South Yemen was divided into six [governorates](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorate "Governorate") (Arabic sg. _muhafazah_), with roughly [natural boundaries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_boundaries "Natural boundaries"), each given a name by [numeral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_(linguistics) "Numeral (linguistics)"). From 1967 to 1978, they were named officially by numerals only; from 1979 to 1990, they were given new official names. The islands: [Kamaran](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamaran "Kamaran") (until 1972, when it was seized by North Yemen), [Perim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perim "Perim"), [Socotra](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socotra "Socotra"), [Abd-el-Kuri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al_Kuri "Abd al Kuri"), Samha (inhabited), [Darsah](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darsah "Darsah") and others uninhabited from the Socotra archipelago were districts (_mudiriyah_) of the First/Aden Governorate being under the Prime Minister's state supervision.<sup id="cite_ref-75"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-75">[70]</a></sup>

## Economy [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Economy")

[GDR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany "East Germany") working on infrastructure projects in South Yemen

During British rule, economic development in South Yemen was restricted to the city of [Aden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden "Aden"), focused mainly on the port and on the British military bases. As a result, following the British withdrawal, there here was little to no [industrial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_sector "Industrial sector") output or [mineral wealth exploitation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining "Mining") in the country until the mid-1980s, when significant [petroleum reserves](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_reserves "Petroleum reserves") in the central regions near [Shibam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibam "Shibam") and [Mukalla](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukalla "Mukalla") were discovered. Foreign aid was minimal, as the British government did not fulfill promises of aid and the Soviet Union offered only [US$](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_dollar "US dollar")152 million from 1969 to 1980.<sup id="cite_ref-Lackner_2017_67-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Lackner_2017-67">[62]</a></sup>

The main sources of income were agriculture, mostly fruit, [cereal crops](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal_crop "Cereal crop"), cattle and sheep, and fishing. The government guaranteed full employment in agriculture for rural citizens, and established a number of collective farms, however, those set up following the [Soviet model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivization_in_the_Soviet_Union "Collectivization in the Soviet Union") produced poorer results than cooperative-run farms.<sup id="cite_ref-Lackner_2017_67-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-Lackner_2017-67">[62]</a></sup>

The national [budget](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget "Budget") was 13.43 million dinars in 1976, and the [gross national product](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_product "Gross national product") was [US$](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_dollar "US dollar")650 - 500  million. The total national [debt](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt "Debt") was $52.4 million.

### Economic policy [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Economic policy")

Limited natural resources posed challenges to the economic development of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). Despite this constraint, significant, albeit modest, oil reserves were discovered shortly after the country's unification in 1990. However, the YSP government did not benefit from oil exports to fund its development initiatives.<sup id="cite_ref-76"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-76">[71]</a></sup>

Over time, economic policies in the PDRY underwent a transformation, shifting from an initial focus on developing the state sector to promoting cooperative and joint private-public enterprises. By the late 1980s, there was a notable presence of industries in Aden and around Al Mukalla in Hadramawt, producing a range of essential goods such as plastics, batteries, cigarettes, matches, tomato paste, dairy products, and fish canning.<sup id="cite_ref-77"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-77">[72]</a></sup>

Within the industrial sector, the state implemented welfarist labor laws that were widely enforced. These laws included regulations aimed at safeguarding women in the workforce by prohibiting night shifts and hazardous occupations. Additionally, the legislation ensured that workers received salaries that enabled them to maintain reasonable living standards. Trade unions in the PDRY primarily functioned as state entities rather than as negotiating bodies, playing a significant role in upholding labor regulations and standards.<sup id="cite_ref-78"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-78">[73]</a></sup>

### Oil [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Oil")

A few months after [The Events of '86](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Events_of_%2786 "The Events of '86"), the PDRY had discovered oil after more than 6 decades of unsuccessful exploration,<sup id="cite_ref-79"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-79">[74]</a></sup> the Soviet Union discovered oil in the [Shabwah Governorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabwah_Governorate "Shabwah Governorate") in late 1986, marking a turning point for the resource-scarce nation.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_80-0"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:6-80">[75]</a></sup> Decades of unsuccessful exploration efforts, hampered by the harsh desert environment and political instability, had left South Yemen heavily reliant on foreign aid, primarily from the Soviet Union, and remittances from its citizens working abroad, estimated to be around half of government revenue by the mid-1980s. The discovery, made by the Soviet oil company Technoexport, emerged amidst the Cold War, with the Soviet Union playing a crucial role in the exploration and discovery process.<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-81">[76]</a></sup>

In 1980s, Technoexport contracted with the PDRY to search for oil in a 13,500-square-mile area in Shabwa, and, in 1984, launched a program of exploratory drilling. This Soviet effort yielded only traces of oil over the next two years, a sharp contrast to the discovery and rapid exploitation of oil in the same period by an American company, [Hunt Oil](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_Oil_Company "Hunt Oil Company"), in- the YAR's [Marib](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marib "Marib") basin, an area just to the west of Shabwa. Then, in late 1986, the Soviets struck very high quality oil in western Shabwa, an occurrence confirmed by authorities in Aden in early 1987.

By late March, Initial estimates placed the oil reserves at around 1 billion barrels,<sup id="cite_ref-:6_80-1"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:6-80">[75]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-82"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-82">[77]</a></sup> sparking plans for pipeline construction and full-scale production of the oil fields. events moved swiftly, and industry sources reported in mid-1987 that the three fields - **lyad East**, **lyad West**, and **Amal** already had a productive capacity of 10,000 barrels per day (bpd), that between 5,000-10,000 bpd were being trucked to the Aden refinery, and that there were plans to increase the number of trucks on the oil run to bring deliveries up to 25,000 bpd, considerably more than the PDRY's total domestic need at the time.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_80-2"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:6-80">[75]</a></sup> The discovery was viewed as a potential pathway to reduce dependence on external sources of income and improve the lives of South Yemen's roughly 2.4 million citizens. However, the joy of discovery was accompanied by a multitude of challenges.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_80-3"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:6-80">[75]</a></sup>

Western Shabwa was not the only exploration area, and the Soviet Union was not the only explorer in the second half of the 1980s.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_80-4"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:6-80">[75]</a></sup> Replying to a claim that the PDRY had put all of its eggs in one basket, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy and Minerals Salih Abu-Bakr ibn Husaynun noted in late 1987 that eight Western and Arab companies were engaged in exploration efforts in several areas in the PDRY.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_80-5"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:6-80">[75]</a></sup> This count seems about right. Although Italy's Agip stopped work in late 1985, Brazil's Braspetrol, France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine (Elf) and Compagnie Franqaise des Petroles ([Total](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TotalEnergies "TotalEnergies")), Kuwait's Independent Petroleum Group, and Canadian Occidental were among the firms actively searching for oil in the years that followed.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_80-6"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:6-80">[75]</a></sup>

The Soviet involvement in the discovery, estimated to have cost over half a billion dollars and add to South Yemen's already staggering debt, raised concerns about potential political and economic influence in the region.<sup id="cite_ref-:6_80-7"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-:6-80">[75]</a></sup> Additionally, the oil find added a layer of complexity to the already intricate relationship between South and North Yemen, both of which desired unification and saw the resource, estimated to hold the potential for substantial economic benefits, as a potential driver of economic prosperity.<sup id="cite_ref-83"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-83">[78]</a></sup>

Furthermore, South Yemen grappled with internal political struggles and social unrest at the time of the discovery. The violent leadership struggle within the ruling communist party, culminating in the January 1986 "blood bath" in Aden, further destabilized the nation. This volatile political landscape cast a shadow over the potential benefits of the newfound oil wealth and raised questions about how the resources would be managed and distributed fairly within the nation.<sup id="cite_ref-84"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-84">[79]</a></sup>

### Airlines [edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Yemen&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Airlines")

The following airlines had operated from the PDRY:<sup id="cite_ref-85"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-85">[80]</a></sup>

-   [Aden Airways](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden_Airways "Aden Airways")<sup id="cite_ref-86"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-86">[81]</a></sup> (1949–1967). Ceased operations on 30 June 1967 at the time of British withdrawal from the [Federation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_South_Arabia "Federation of South Arabia") and the [Protectorate of South Arabia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectorate_of_South_Arabia "Protectorate of South Arabia").
-   [Alyemda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyemda "Alyemda") – Democratic Yemen Airlines (1961–1996). Joined [Yemenia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemenia "Yemenia"), the airline of the former [YAR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen_Arab_Republic "Yemen Arab Republic")
-   The Brothers Airline Service Corporation was formed by Sayid Zein A. Baharoon who used the “Brothers” nomenclature in his merchant enterprises. Known as BASCO, this fledgling airline lasted only a short time.<sup id="cite_ref-87"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Yemen#cite_note-87">[82]</a></sup>
