## How did marijuana legalization break into the mainstream while other controversial issues, who had/have more support, have stayed on the fringes? What can we learn from this movement?

Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/194t3ut/how_did_marijuana_legalization_break_into_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/194t3ut/how_did_marijuana_legalization_break_into_the/)

> Euthanasia has had fairly high support since the 90's. It's hovered between the 65% to 75% for almost 3 decades (72% back in 2018 according to a Gallup poll). Despite overwhelming support for such a long time, only 11 jurisdictions have legalized it. In fact, euthanasia still has more support than many issues, including gay marriage and abortion issues. 
> 
> On the other hand, 24 states, along with Washington DC and Guam, have legalized marijuana since 2012. When Colorado legalized marijuana, only 47% of Americans supported legalization. 12 years later, 88% of people support legalization in some form (either recreational *and* medicinal, or solely medicinal).

	>Is euthanasia just that unmarketable?

	I think so. And part of it is because people might agree with it in theory, but there is a variety of conditions of real examples of right-to-die cases that make decisions harder, and the topic gets more controversial. For instance, the Jack Kevorkian controversy and the Terri Schiavo case.

			And discussions of marijuana legalization, gay marriage, capital punishment, and many other things.  Even on issues like corporal punishment in schools and trust in science, atheists are far to the left of almost every large religious tradition.   When there's resistance to making clergy mandatory reporters for child sexual abuse, that's religion.   LGBT "conversion" therapy, defense of child marriage, opposition to sex ed in schools, etc, all religion.

				huh... Athiests don't care about immigration? I wonder why that is? honestly, I really struggle to care about all the illegal immigration at the southern border.

					The link specifies legal immigration.  And it may be that they do care about it, in that they support legal immigration.  Or at the very least have little receptivity to reducing it.   Might be related to the later link on racial resentment.

		Another related issue is the lack of success stories from satisfied customers. The public has had 60+ years of celebrities bragging they were smoking weed and everything was fine, while people who want euthanasia can't really do the same. Kevorkian tried to be that, but you're still taking his word for it, and he was honestly a bit off-putting for a lot of people.
		
		Pancreatic cancer has had a similar issue of it not having any living advocates for spending on research to beat it, since it so consistently kills people so quickly

		I think prosecutions also come into play here. I'd wager that physician assisted suicide happens a lot in those cases where people agree with it and there's hardly any prosecutions for it. Meanwhile 8 million people were arrested for marijuana from 2001-2010.
		
		You've also got high profile people who've admitted to using marijuana, including Obama, W. Bush, Gore, and Harris. I can't recall a case of a high profile politician or celebrity admitting to helping a relative be euthanized (I'm sure some have though, and there's an obvious reason to not admit to it).

		Euthanasia is mostly a problem with the religious groups. 
		
		In a totally unscientific anecdote sharing poll I do on Reddit all the time a lot more people are open to it than not. 
		
		Like everything else, religion framed this as killing versus dying with dignity. 
		
		I occasionally share an opinion that privatized hospitals makes it too easy to force people to take tests and procedures that won’t extend life very long or allow people to go home. In my experience relatives have spent their last 6 months locked inside a hospital room. 
		
		Instead they could have been sent home, fed painkillers and let them die peacefully overnight but then the CEO of the hospital wouldn’t get his raise that year.

		* 🟧 **[Resolution_Sea](https://www.reddit.com/user/Resolution_Sea)** ⬆️ 7 _(2024-01-12 15:34:44)_

			It's not just religion, you're asking a bunch of people about euthanasia who mostly haven't been confronted with that choice either at all and certainly not while they're responding.
			
			When my father went on the vent after getting covid and it came down to DNR and just recognizing that he wasn't going to make it, it was a lot harder to accept at that time with his future in the balance than it is a few years out able to look back with some objectivity and no hope that things might turn around because it's done and in the past
			
			People probably do majorly favor euthanasia, it doesn't mean that view is going to be as consistent or enthusiastic when it comes to their loved ones even if they rationally understand otherwise. Religion helps people live in denial of the reality but it's not the reason itself why people are scared of death for themselves and/or loved ones when it finally shows up, it's scary because real loss is hard and any opinion outside of those conditions goes out the window when it's not just giving a casual opinion and now it's real

				I don’t expect people to change their minds tomorrow but I really wish we could start having the conversation about it. 
				
				Given the inevitable medical bankruptcy for a few weeks more we all might experience, education and options are needed. 
				
				At the very least, make estate planning in the US a common thing. Medicare will cover all your medical expenses but only after it drains all your finances first (it can’t go after your home if you own it). By hiding your money behind an estate that will then handle all your bills and expenses, aside from the legal work to set everything up, nothing changes for you… except when Medicare looks to drain your account, nothing is there.

					I'm not saying that the issue is people changing their minds though, I'm saying the issue is a lot of people can't be honest about how they feel about it until they're confronted by a choice for themselves or someone else. It's easy to have opinions on what should be, it's another to be in the situation yourself and have major consequences attached, it's not always easy to have the same opinions then

						There are plenty of politicians that have decriminalization of sex work in their platform but economic considerations tend to go towards the workers with the premise of individual economic liberty as opposed to industrial commercialization, so the economic pressures on the political apparatus are not profound enough to overcome existing social opposition.
						
						But also in most instances of cannabis legalization, ballot initiatives have to overcome legislative hesitancy largely due to lobbying of established industries in opposition buttressed by significant conservative social pressure/influence on half the system. Legislation started getting passed after large scale industry had been established in other states and started wielding influence in less conservative statehouses.

						Definitely a factor…though I think the equation is something like 
						
						[commercial marketability]^2 +/- [social marketability] = [political marketability]
						
						Social marketability could be a positive or negative factor, but not one that generally overcomes the commercial aspect unless the social aspect bleeds into the economy (protests, boycotts, strikes, etc) and becomes its own factor in the commercial marketability. Eg…People don’t want congress to trade stocks, but no one’s losing money over it so nothing is happening; unpopular wars are still fought; etc.
						
						But on the other hand…there’s a reason there is so much effort put into manufacturing social marketability on behalf of commercial marketability so wtf do I know? Third side of that coin is that misdirection/misinformation or just over exposure to a position is commonly used to generate social marketability and lack of resources in opposition of commercial interests is its own factor within the commercial marketability…round and round we go.

	The anti marijuana side uses fear of what will happen. Colorado legalized, and none of the bad things happened they said would. How can any rational person look at the arguments against marijuana and believe them when there's clear evidence to the contrary now?  Same can be said of things like homosexual marriage, that was going to destroy traditional marriage. Now that it's legal, and the fear mongering has proven to be lies, you see far more support than there was when it's legalized. 

	The fear that was initially there in some of those who opposed marijuana legalization has been proven irrational, and many have changed their minds.  

	When you look at an issue like assisted suicide, those fears aren't erased. There is still a fear that it could be abused in some way. Even rational people who don't oppose it morally may still fear the consequences.  The fear around this is more difficult to prove incorrect than the fear that marijuana legalization will lead to higher crime or overdose deaths.

	Cannabis legalization makes people with the resources to get started a lot of money. It’s easy for politicians to succumb to that sort of pressure, especially when on the other side of the spectrum you have groups pushing for legalization due to skewed impacts on poor/working class communities. 

	I just don’t see the money making opportunities behind euthanasia regardless of the humanitarian argument. Rather the healthcare industry would probably lose money overall due to the lack of care/pharmaceuticals/etc they would provide to people in their most expensive time of life.

	I think the whole issue with marijuana is that you have a bunch of people who grew up being told that marijuana was a gateway drug as addictive as heroin and as dangerous as cigarettes, and neither was true. 

	Euthanasia has a *very* strong religious component in its opposition that marijuana doesn't.  While religion is less important than ever to the general American public, it still enjoys massive popularity and still has impacts on how people vote and approach the world, and legal euthanasia is a much harder sell.

	In all fairness … as far as moral implications are concerned, recreational marijuana use isn't exactly the same thing as euthanasia or abortion.

	You could easily argue it's none of my business if you smoke weed in your past time.

	But if you look at the situation in e.g. Belgium or the Netherlands (both pioneers in the legalisation of euthanasia), you'll find cases suggesting that assisted suicide isn't just a private matter but one of grave social impact.

	There was a case in the Netherlands were an old lady changed her mind but was literally pinned down by her family as her doctor killed her anyway. They were cleared of wrongdoing, shockingly enough.

	There have been assisted suicides in Belgium were people ended their lives because of mild afflictions, in one instance even a bad case of hay fever (I'm not kidding).

	There was a case in Belgium were a teenage girl who'd been raped was granted assisted suicide because she didn't want to live anymore.

	And these are just examples detailing the risk to the emotionally vulnerable. 

	There are many other problems that need considering.

	So, no, these are totally different issues. In my mind it's hardly surprising they're treated as such by the public.

	To the evangelicals euthanasia is going to be a hard "no" because it's considered the ultimate sin to commit suicide even if it is assisted. 

	The reason marijuana has gained so much favorable traction is because of the money involved in it and also because of the medicinal benefits. People have petitioned tirelessly for decades to ease the damage done by scheduling it as a class 1 narcotic and making it unable or next to impossible to do any R&amp;D with. 

	What can we learn from this movement? This is an easy answer.

	Funnily enough in europe euthanasia is more widely adopted than cannabis legalisation.

	One major difference between these two is the degree of religiousness. In christian faith suicide is a sinn that bars you from heaven - a sinn that cannot be forgiven as you cannot confess that sinn since you are dead.

	We have seen with pregnancy termination how strong the influence of christian faith still is in US so I think this also applies to euthanasia.

	Weed legalization is an easy pitch to make. You’ve got a decent chunk of the country who are/were stoners at some point. There’s tax dollars in it. It helps solve some racial issues in policing. And there’s not any major ways it can go sideways - you’ll need to be a bit more on the ball about ensuring kids don’t smoke, but that’s a relatively minor thing. 

	Euthanasia is something people have strong opinions on. It’s also sparked some ethical issues in countries where it’s legalized (see: Canadians with PTSD being asked if they’d like to die when they’re trying to seek mental health treatment)

	Euthanasia has almost zero impact on people's lives.

	If you're a supporter of euthanasia, your euthanasia rights are going to affect you, at most, one single time in your entire life, and that is assuming you'd even do it. The vast majority of people who support the right to it wouldn't actually do it themselves.

	&amp;#x200B;

	So, even if it has broad support, it's an issue that effects a tiny sliver of the population only once ever.

	&amp;#x200B;

	Meanwhile as stoner is gonna smoke pot as a daily habit, and even casual users are gonna do it at least a few times a year.

	&amp;#x200B;

	So, put simply, even if both issues have support, one has a larger material impact and the other does not, therefore one gets fought for and the other gets talked about.

	In my view, there were 5 drivers that pushed the marijuana movement forward to legalization in many states.

	1. The opposition to marijuana was so old school, so harsh, prohibition based, just say NO, abstinence based...it did not reflect the reality on the ground. The science based reality is that weed only affects the health of a small to moderate percentage of users in a harmful way (especially teens) . [Psychosis, increased depression](https://whoadude-the-book.com),  and other [mental health issues](https://whoadude-the-book.com/references/), pregnancy issues, etc. only happen in some people, not everybody. Everyone knows that smoking a joint on the deck on Friday night listening to the Grateful Dead or Trampled by Turtles is not going to kill you. But if your teen gets Psychosis, it's a tragedy.

	2. The war on drugs has been a massive failure, that has been obvious. Also, incarceration due to marijuana resonated with the public. The public was told that there are a large number of people incarcerated for simple possession of weed, which is not true. The large majority of people incarcerated for weed are there for trafficking, or weed plus more serious crimes.

	3. Money. The huge tax revenue from legalized weed sales is are stars in a politician's eyes. Each adjoining states sees the tax revenue in the state next door and says, "Why can't we get in on that? " The states are falling like dominoes.

	4. Medical Marijuana was passed first as a camel nose under the tent. That legitimized the players. When the sky didn't come crashing down, then came recreational weed. 

	5. Proponents often used ballot initiatives by popular vote rather than legislation in more conservative state houses. The general public is more amenable to legal weed than the more conservative legislators.

	p.s. There's no money in euthanasia

	I lived in Washington when the dam finally broke.  Aside from the fact that lots of people already smoked weed without legal consequences and there was a pretty tolerant attitude about it, the argument the finally pushed legalization through was almost purely economic.  

	Basically, the state was sacrificing a huge amount of sales and other taxes by having it illegal.  People were going to smoke anyway, so let's get in on the game.  There were the side benefits of not having to police it and jail people for it, which impacted some areas more than others (in Seattle though you could smoke on the street and a cop would basically tell you to put it out). 

	You can't make those arguments with Euthanasia, and it's not a hot issue, so it gets bumped down the priority list.  Even lawmakers who may agree it should be legal have things they think are more important to pursue.  

	Oh, and people like to get high.
