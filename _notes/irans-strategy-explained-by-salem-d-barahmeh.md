## Iranâ€™s Strategy, Explained.

"You'd probably never guessed the origins of Iranian strategy, and you shouldn't, because
misunderstanding Iran is dangerous.
What if I told you, mountain climbing, an ancient form of wrestling, and the invention of
the highway by the Persian Empire, can shed light on Iran's national strategy for power
and survival, while confronting Israel, the US, and the West?
Let's go back in time.
To the year I was born.

1989.
This man, Ali Khmeri became Iran's supreme leader and the highest authority in the country.
To set the scene, this was ten years after the Islamic Revolution, and a devastating war
with a US backed Iraq that lasted almost a decade.
That conjuncture of history shaped how Ali Khmeri saw the world.
One filled with existential threats from the US and Israel, in which Iran had relatively
little power as a young regime.
So what kind of strategy do you build to confront this reality?
Ali Khmeri's love for mountain climbing is the perfect metaphor to explain his approach
to international relations.
See, the climbers journey to the summit is long, filled with grueling physical demands and
the need to overcome setbacks when confronted with harsh conditions.
To reach the top, climber must show determination, endurance, and most importantly, patience, strategic
patience.
The strategic principle is about tolerating short-term hardship and pursuit of conditions
that would enable victory long-term.
More simply put, it is sometimes necessary to lose a battle now to win the war later.
Khmeri sees the struggle against the West as one measured in decades and centuries
rather than in months or years.
Strategic patience is also found in Shi'a revolutionary ideology that promotes stoic endurance
and the concept of Tsar-Baz, soldiers that are willing to sacrifice for the greater good.
This approach has been central and dealing with decades of Iran's isolation and western
sanctions that have devastated the country's economy.
Created the ethos that we must endure to win, the other tenant of strategic patience
is being measured, calculated, and disciplined in its military warfare.
Never picking fights, it cannot win.
Which is contrary to the image of Iran and the West of being a rogue state that is out of control.
Iran almost never chooses full confrontation with the US or Israel, despite the targeting
of its nationals and military assets.
The most famous example is when the US assassinated Iranian general, Khatim Suwanarni,
was Iran's top military operative.
You know, we hit them very hard for something that they did and they had to hit back.
They feel they have to do that and I understand that.
Do you know they called me to tell me we're going to hit a certain location, but we're
not going to hit it.
It's going to be outside of the perimeter.
We'll call you.
Iran's response was choreographed and limited in scope to avoid a major war with the US.
Why?
Because Iran's assessment was that conditions were not right for victory then.
But now, there has been a fundamental change.
Calculations have shifted.
Iraq on Iran's consulate building in Syria.
Following Israel's attack on its consulate, for the first time ever, Iran responded with
a direct, large-scale missile and drone attack on Israeli territory.
If you think the military response was about saving face, you severely misunderstand it
on.
The attack provided Iran with intelligence on Israeli and American defensive capabilities
while costing them $1 billion.
It showed hysteria, more or weakness, psychological breakdown and loose nerves of the Israeli leadership
and society.
It further isolated countries in the region who came to Israel's defense and most importantly,
it challenged the US and Israeli deterrence.
Once the attack was done, Iran proclaimed that the era of strategic patience was over,
but this is only one part of the story.
Strategies are never one-dimensional, and are the product of many influences.
In the case of Iran, it's the legacy of the Persian civilization and an ancient former
for wrestling that traces back its lineage to ancient Persia.
The Khoshti Palvanu, also known as heroic wrestling, has been used for centuries to train
Persian warriors for battle.
It is part of a wider martial arts and training tradition that merges the physical and spiritual
and becomes a way of life.
Wrestling is the country's national sport and has offered a guide for Hamini on strategy.
One of his most famous speeches, he called for heroic flexibility.
He said, heroic flexibility has a clear meaning, an example of which can be found in wrestling
competitions that aim at defeating the enemy.
Someone has strength but does not use flexibility where needed, they will certainly be defeated.
However, the user flexibility and power promptly can pin the rival down to the mat.
A wrestler sometimes shows flexibility for technical reasons, but he shouldn't forget
whose opponent an enemy is.
Hamini's lesson compromises necessary to win in diplomacy and internal relations, but
don't forget who you are fighting and what you're fighting for.
Heroic flexibility has dictated Iran's willingness to engage and compromise with the West.
The most famous example is negotiating and entering the nuclear agreement with the US.
But it goes beyond that.
The relations between states is often a game of chess and choreography and Iran has shown
a mastery at that because it understands its underdog position.
For its response attack on Israel, it followed the principles of international law, alerted
the US and its allies via intermediaries about the details of the targets and the missiles
and quickly utilized multilateral forms like the UN to announce it doesn't seek escalation.
This show of heroic flexibility was about sending a message, we are not a rogue state like
Israel, we follow international principles and we believe in diplomacy.
This was to further isolate Israel and its allies.
The combination of strategic patience and heroic flexibility has led to a new strategic
reality which can be best explained through highways.
The Persian Empire was the first superpower in the history of the world.
Its invention of the highway allowed the movement of people and goods across vast
territory incredibly efficiently and effectively, contributing to its large growth, moving
its army across these highways allowed it to maintain security, stability and longevity
as an empire.
But also, it made it powerful at waging war, especially when utilizing the predominant strategy
of the time.
Incircument.
Incircument is a military maneuver of surrounding, isolating and attacking your enemy on all sides.
With its ability to move a large number of troops so effectively with these highways,
the Persian excelled at incircument, completely overwhelming the enemy from multiple fronts.
And this brings us to the third Iranian strategic pillar, the Terrence.
Facing adversaries with more advanced military capabilities and larger alliances, Iran has
utilized encircument of Israel, the US and others in the region as a form of deterrence
while it exercises its strategic patience.
Iran developed its own alliances and proxies in strategic locations that can exploit
the vulnerabilities of its enemies and can fight them multiple fronts, whilst famously
hisballa in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.
But logic is, if we can directly confront the US and Israel, let others do it on our
behalf.
This geopolitical chess game offered a first line of defense and deterrence for Iran
that would make others think twice about taking military action against it.
But this has come at a massive cost and at the expense of millions of people whose countries
have been destabilized and destroyed.
And millions more have been killed injured or made refugees.
As we move forward, it is likely that Iran will continue to use heroic flexibility and
encircument deterrence as key parts of its strategy.
But as it announces the end of the era of strategic patience, with its military response
to Israel, this might signal the start of a new era.
Direct deterrence.
Any attack on us will be met with a direct attack and response.
This is how mountain climbing, wrestling and highways can help us understand one of the
most misunderstood countries in the world.
