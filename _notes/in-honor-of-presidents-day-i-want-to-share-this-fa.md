## In honor of Presidents day, I want to share this fascinating photo. Just published in And There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle, by Jon Meacham. “Recently found in a forgotten archive belonging to Lincoln photographer Matthew Brady, this 1861 image captures a moment of intimacy between Lincoln and Charles Darwin. On a speaking tour of the United States in the wake of his 1859 groundbreaking work On the Origin of Species, Darwin spent a quiet afternoon with the President. The two men got along famously, sharing delight at discovering they had the same birth date, Feb 12, 1809. And there was an obvious attraction, as both men were known to be distant and lonely but found kinship in each other’s company. Lincoln was fascinated by the new theory of natural selection, especially the assertion that man evolved from monkeys. Lincoln had been referred to as ‘that damned long-armed ape,’ by early rival Edwin Stanton, and was often lambasted in political cartoons as a monkey or ape. 
‘Mr Darwin,” the president is reported saying with his big and generous smile, ‘I think you might be on to something there.’”
