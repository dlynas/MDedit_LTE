One feature of that depression was that I developed an acute fear of becoming homeless—
deepened, T think, by my friendship with R. If you spend any amount of time actually
getting to know homeless people, you realize how quickly a life can become undone: an
addiction that spirals out of control at the wrong time; a mental breakdown without
family and friends to sustain you; a bad decision followed by a bad break. The depressed
mind, usually so lethargic, nevertheless manages to conjure up the most elaborate
scenarios of doom. However ridiculous it might seem, I made a number of my closest
friends swear on their honor to take me in if T got to such a point. That fear of falling
came back to me when I read this passage from the notes of one of Scialabba’s therapists:

He now has multiple fears of losing control, which he fantasizes would result in his
becoming passive, being unable to hold a job, going on welfare or into a hospital, and
not being able to take care of himself.
