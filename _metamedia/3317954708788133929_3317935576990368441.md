I don’t believe that we “find ourselves”
in isolation. I think that making time and
space for yourself — a hike, a morning
with your journal, a walk to the park, a
meditation practice, an exercise routine,
etc. — is invaluable, and | encourage it
all the time, but the idea that you will
find yourself in isolation is a false
narrative, in my opinion. We are human
beings and we do not exist in isolation.
We exist in community.
