Zionist colonisation must either stop, or else proceed regardless of the native
population. Which means that it can proceed and develop only under the protection of
a power that is independent of the native population — behind an iron wall, which the

native population cannot breach.

That is our Arab policy; not what we should be, but what it actually is,
whether we admit it or not. What need, otherwise, of the Balfour Declaration? Or of
the Mandate? Their value to us is that outside Power has undertaken to create in the
country such conditions of administration and security that if the native population

should desire to hinder our work, they will find it impossible.

And we are all of us ,without any exception, demanding day after day that this

outside Power, should carry out this task vigorously and with determination.

In this matter there is no difference between our "militarists" and our
"vegetarians”. Except that the first prefer that the iron wall should consist of Jewish

soldiers, and the others are content that they should be British.

We all demand that there should be an iron wall. Yet we keep spoiling our
own case, by talking about "agreement" which means telling the Mandatory
Government that the important thing is not the iron wall, but discussions. Empty
rhetoric of this kind is dangerous. And that is why it is not only a pleasure but a duty

to discredit it and to demonstrate that it is both fantastic and dishonest.
Zionism Moral and Just
Two brief remarks:
In the first place, if anyone objects that this point of view is immoral, I
answer: It is not true: either Zionism is moral and just ,or it is immoral and unjust.

But that is a question that we should have settled before we became Zionists.

Actually we have settled that question, and in the affirmative.
