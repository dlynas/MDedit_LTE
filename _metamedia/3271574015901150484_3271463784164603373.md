““NEVER IN HISTORY HAS VIOLENCE
BEEN INITIATED BY THE OPPRESSED.
HOwW COULD THEY BE THE INITIATORS,
IF THEY THEMSELVES ARE THE RESULT
OF VIOLENCE? HOW COULD THEY BE
THE SPONSORS OF SOMETHING WHOSE
OBJECTIVE INAUGURATION CALLED
FORTH THEIR EXISTENCE AS
OPPRESSED? THERE WOULD BE NO
OPPRESSED HAD THERE BEEN NO
PRIOR SITUATION OF VIOLENCE TO

g ESTABLISH THEIR SUBJUGATION.”
