If you think you can bypass the
impact of human supremacies in your
pursuit of the Sacred or Earth healing,
I would humbly offer that this has not
been my conclusion after 30 years of
focusing on ritual arts. Come on back.

If you think our species as a whole
will make the needed Earth changes
without radically healing our
perceived isolation from the rest of life
(a.k.a. human supremacy itself), that
has also not been my observation. All
of the above, all at once.

- Daniel Foor
