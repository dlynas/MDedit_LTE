Translated from Arabic by Google

The two most important hospitals in Gwigol=#
"Nasser and Al-Amal", have been surrounded for days
by tanks and are subjected to continuous heavy
bombardment.

Hospital massacres continue silently, without talk or
condemnation. The annihilation of hospitals has
become a common occurrence.
