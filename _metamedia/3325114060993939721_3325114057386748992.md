If you are working or yourself and
you notice relationships change,
please do not fear that you are doing
something wrong. | know it feels
strange and at times unsettling, but
these shifts are critical to your inner
wellbeing. Trust that any change that
comes as a result of your growth is
always serving your highest good.
