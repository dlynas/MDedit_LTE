In this stage you realise that the world we, humans,
have created is fueled by greed and power- NOTHING
else. It makes you realise that the life we live is
overwhelmingly fake/dull/pointless, with only small
pockets of forced/faked happiness. Even in those rare
moments, there's a constant and loud sense of
emptiness and irrelevance.
