Five Nation Longhouse Confederacy

KAUNAWAKE KANTENKEIAIXA NATION
Five days after the 4™ Full Moon, April 28* 2

We stand in support with all who are occupying to divest institutions of higher learning (megill
university montreal) from isracl’s genocide upon the Palestinian Nation

In accord with the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty, the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk) People of the Five
Nations LongHouse Confederacy, Kahnawake, Turtle Island, have observed the behaviour of the european
for the last $00 hundred years. They persist in their systemic colonial genocidal wars upon our Mother

Earth and all Original Peoples and our territories here in Tuntle Island and abroad, including Palestine

Here, they were compelled into the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty, obliging them to conduct
themselves in a proper “Nation to Nation™ human relation. However they lied since they first stepped foot
cre in Turtle Island. They created the so called indian act under which they kidnapped, raped., terrorized
and murdered our native children in the british/nazi residential school concentration camps, with the
express intent of “killing the Native out of our children” (General R H. Pratt, so-called united-states.
1892, reaffirmed by Stephen Harper, prime minister, so-called canada, 2008).

Through britain’s worldwide colonial infrastructure, “the indian act” policy was exported to South-Africa
renaming it “apartheid”, committing the same genocide upon the ( al Peoples of that territory

Through the same colonial infrastructure, the South-Africa apartheid was exported 10 istael, to genocide
upon the Palestinian People. under the united nation's creation of the so-called state of isracl

We are happy 10 sce that students within universities and colleges are occupying their campuses in
solidarity with the massacred Palestinian children, women and men, to force their campus administrat
divest from isral’s genocide. Institutions of higher learning must not be invested in or connected to any
genocide, war or military action, as they are supposed to engage students her levels of thought
conducive o human evolution. Contrarily, any and all war or military actions are intrinsic with the most
primitive and lower levels of human thought, hastening the devolution of humanity, in actions like what
d in Kent state university in Ohio in 1969, where the national guard assassinated four people that

ainst the vietnam war

Therefore, in accordance with the Two Row Wampum Peace Treaty, we grant the full right to those who
are occupying McGill and other campuses throughout Turtle Island to be upon the said lands, with the
expressed intent of engaging their administrations to divest from the colonial genocide of israel upon the

Palestinian People and from the war machine in ges

everyone to support these actions and stand in solidarity with the Palestinian People, with

the spirit of the Two-Row Wampum Peace Treaty - be peace, do not let the despise of their hatred fool y
