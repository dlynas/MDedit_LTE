Jack would also like to point out that Amazon Music
also has the same subscription price as Spotify
($10.99) but only offers $0.004/stream (at 13.3% of
the market prop). That means, by the same proportion
as the previous post, Amazon pays around half as
much (0.58x) as Spotify. Again, Apple/Amazon are
companies that have alternative revenue sources &
should be capable of offering much more
(proportionally) than Spotify.

Additionally, Mr. Skellington finds it particularly
notable that Spotify publicly shows stream counts &
shares this wrapped data yearly (despite consistent

backlash) while the other companies do not.
