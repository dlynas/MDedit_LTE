I’'ve moved back to the United States twice since
my birth. Once as a child, after the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. Then again for graduate
school. I’d had the privilege of a youth —
adolescence and young adulthood — in
countries where being Palestinian was fairly
common. The identity could be heavy, but it
wasn’t a contested one. I hadn’t had to learn the
respectability politics of being a Palestinian
adult. I learned quickly.

The task of the Palestinian is to be palatable or
to be condemned. The task of the Palestinian,
we’ve seen in the past two weeks, is to audition
for empathy and compassion. To prove that we
deserve it. To earn it.
