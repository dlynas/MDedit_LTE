The federal government is investigating
whether Eric Adams received illegal
campaign donations from Turkey.

“Federal prosecutors and the F.B.l. are conducting a broad
public corruption investigation into whether Mayor Eric
Adams’s 2021 election campaign conspired with the Turkish
government to receive illegal foreign donations, according to a
search warrant obtained by The New York Times.

The investigation burst into public view on Thursday when
federal agents conducted an early-morning raid at the
Brooklyn home of the mayor’s chief fund-raiser, Brianna
Suggs — a campaign consultant who is deeply entwined with
efforts to advance the mayor’s agenda.

Investigators also sought to learn more about the potential
involvement of a Brooklyn construction company with ties to
Turkey, as well as a small university in D.C., that also has ties
to the country and to Adams. According to the search warrant,
investigators were also focused on whether the mayor’s
campaign kicked back benefits to the construction company’s
officials and employees, and to Turkish officials.

The agents seized three iPhones and two laptop computers,
along with papers and other evidence, including something
agents identified as “manila folder labeled Eric Adams,” seven
“contribution card binders” and other materials.”
