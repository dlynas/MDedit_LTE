Find yourself and form yourself in
community. This may require a lot of you,
especially in terms of vulnerability and
growth. You may have to push through
discomforts, but how else? Donâ€™t let
Western individualism drive you out of
community. Be in community, especially
working-class community, and as part of
that community, find yourself in the work
of liberation, which is the only work that
can truly help your community. Find
yourself in the work.
