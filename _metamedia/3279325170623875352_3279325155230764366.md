performances as the country ranks third in arms
exports worldwide but simultaneously, they also
regret those â€œcomplex and senseless, wars happening
in other parts of the world and shed crocodile tears
over deaths they themselves caused.

For over three months now, we have borne witness
to massacres in high definition and watched a
genocide livestreamed before our eyes for the

but the fact that, for weeks now, death records

have been unable to keep track of the number

of Palestinians killed in Gaza, is truly terrifying.
Palestinians die in the bombings, and under the
rubble. They die of thirst, of hunger. They die in the
West Bank, and they die despairing and insane.
