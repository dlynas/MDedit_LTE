Calla Walsh: Well, I think the most important point to highlight is that Elbit’s stocks have
been dropping consistently since Oct. 7, while every other major defense contractor’s stocks
are skyrocketing, and that is because of the relentless direct action campaign. Every time we
shut down a factory, even for a few hours, it costs Elbit time, money, and resources. Even if
we're a few people throwing paint at a building, the top executives of Elbit are freaking out
when that happens, especially when, as happened in the US a few days ago, three locations
in different states are hit by different groups all in one night. So of course we expect the
state to try to crack down on any resistance, as they have been for decades, even more so
maybe than in the UK because it is a different legal system.

T have someone who's been getting doxxed, getting called a terrorist, getting called an
antisemite for years. And to be honest, I think as people in the West, this kind of blow back
is the very, very bottom of the ladder compared to what people are experiencing if we're
talking about relativity on the global scale, and it's the very, very least we can do to get
locked up in a cell for a few hours compared to Palestinians who are being bombed and
genocided every single day.

So I was one of the people arrested at the action in Cambridge on Monday, Oct. 30. I also

have charges from our first action on Oct. 12. I'm 19. I don't like locking myself to buildings

in my free time. That's not what I do. I'd rather be hanging out with my friends. But the
reality is there's a genocide going on, and it's about time we put our bodies on the line. And
so when I was in jail, what I was thinking was that I would be ready to do it again and again
and again and again until we shut these factories down.
