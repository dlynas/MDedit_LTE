The 1st Principle

JUSTICE

by @laylafsaad

Justiceis a
generational journey.

Justice is an ongoing journey that
extends back and forth through time.
Through justice work we recognise our
interconnections with past, present,
and future humans across the world.

Justice work is both INTRA-
GENERATIONAL (for present
generations), and INTER-
GENERATIONAL (for past and future
generations).

Through justice work we are grounded
in the honouring of our heritage, and
the active hope of our legacy.
