| want for you whatever you want for the
Palestinians.

When | say | want for you what you want for the
Palestinians, | mean what it is that you really,
truly want for them. Not what you pretend to
want for the Palestinians. Not what you say you
want for the Palestinians when you’re in polite
company, or when the cameras are on you, or
when you’re posting online under your real
name, or when you’re speaking publicly in a
language other than Hebrew.

| mean | want for you what you actually,
truthfully want for the Palestinians, in your own
private personal inner world. | hope you receive
whatever that is.
