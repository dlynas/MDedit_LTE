An Update on Gaza:
What You Should Know
March7,2024

A new report revealed that Israeli tanks
have deliberately run over dozens of
Palestinian civilians alive.

A new report from Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor revealed
that the rights group has documented repeated killings of
Palestinian civilians by Israeli forces by “deliberately running
them over alive with military vehicles.”

In one such instance, documented by Euro-Med Monitor, the
Israeli army’s killed a Palestinian man by “deliberately runing
him over in Gaza City’s Al-Zaytoun neighborhood on Feb. 29
after he was arrested. The man was subjected to harsh
interrogation by members of the Israeli army, who bound his
hands with plastic zip-tie handcuffs before running him over
with a military vehicle from the bottom to the top of his body.
Israeli soldiers restrained the victim’s hands before they
crushed him, and tramped on his body from the legs up,
confirming that he was alive during the incident. To guarantee
thorough and complete crushing, the victim was placed on
asphalt rather than in an adjacent sandy area.”
