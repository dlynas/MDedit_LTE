Who you are in isolation is not your “true
self.” Who you are in isolation, is who you
are in isolation. That’s an aspect of you, it
is nowhere near the whole of you. Do you
intend to live your life in isolation? If you
want a life in community, then let that be
the focus of who you are. Who are you
with others? How do you make others feel?
Where would you like to grow in
community with others? You can only
answer these questions in being with
others, especially those who know you,
and whom you know.
