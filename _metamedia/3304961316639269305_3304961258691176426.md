On how passive consumption
affects how deeply we think about
culture

We are not always actively consuming
culture and thinking deeply about the
genius of a painting or a symphony. ... It's
not something we can do all the time.
But what | worry about is the passivity of
consumption that we've been pushed
into, the ways that we're encouraged not
to think about the culture we're
consuming, to not go deeper and not
follow our own inclinations.
