4. Repeatedly each of these people claim that
they are being "yelled out" and the only
reason this could be happening is because
they are Jewish. The only thing they can
imagine is anti-semitism, because they
cannot conceptualize themselves as doing
anything justifying criticism

5. Well, | feel like saying to each of these
people: "The reason you are being criticized,
the reason people are yelling at you, the
reason you are being protested, is because
you are part of a killing machine, murdering
tens of thousands of people, and that is the
only reason."

6. | am just as Jewish looking and sounding as
they are. | have two Jewish names, and a thick
Jewish accent and the people who are yelling
at them are not yelling at me. So, clearly itis
really about politics and values.
