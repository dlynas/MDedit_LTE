LIBERATION IS THE PROCESS OF
HUMANIZATION, OF BECOMING MORE
FULLY HUMAN. ONLY THE OPPRESSED CAN
FIGHT FOR LIBERATION, AND IN THE
PROCESS LIBERATE BOTH THE OPPRESSED
AND THE OPPRESSOR. FIGHTING FOR
LIBERATION IS AN ACT OF LOVE. THIS
FIGHT IS FOR THE RESTORATION OF
HUMANITY FOR ALL PEOPLES. WHEN THE
OPPRESSED FREE THEMSELVES, THEY FREE
THE OPPRESSORS TOO. WHAT CAN BE
MORE LOVING THAN GIVING EVERYTHING
TO RESTORE HUMANITY?
