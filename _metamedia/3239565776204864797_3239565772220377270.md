Abed and Green, both organizers, are focused elsewhere. They
want to know: What are your goals? How are you going to build
the political will to achieve them?

Like Peter Quill in Guardians of the Galaxy, they want to save
Israel-Palestine because they are among the idiots who live
there.

Jews and Palestinians are not going anywhere. They need to
learn how to live together. Both deserve full equality. So, how
do we make that happen?

I think their answer is a good one. By standing together. Jews
and Palestinians. In one movement.
