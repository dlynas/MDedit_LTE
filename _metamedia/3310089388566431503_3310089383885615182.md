I have found myself over the past
few days rereading Toni
Morrison’s 2016 essay with the
New Yorker entitled “Making
America White Again.” I have
returned to it because I need
language and courage at this
moment. “The choices made by
white men, who are prepared to
abandon their humanity out of fear
of black men and women,” she
writes, “suggest the true horror of
lost status.” In order to limit the
possibility of any change, she
says, people are sacrificing
themselves in the process.
