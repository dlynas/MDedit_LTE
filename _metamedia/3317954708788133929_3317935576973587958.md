You want to find yourself? I can’t hate, |
understand the desire. | traveled the
world to “find myself.” This was before
my politics had developed. You know
what | found out there, on the road? A
bunch of confused and depressed
Westerners trying to “find themselves.” |
came home more confused. More
depressed. | have stories for days, but it
wasn't until 1 became politically
conscious and active that I really “found
myself.”
