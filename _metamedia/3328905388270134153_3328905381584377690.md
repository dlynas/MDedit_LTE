Rather than try to get my own needs met in isolation by
following the rules & playing the empire’s game, |
thought more deeply about what WE needed to live with
dignity, which systems deprived us of that right and how
| could serve the collective in a joint struggle for a better
life for us all. As a homie @badschoolbadschool said
recently in a post “I replaced my individual dreams with
collective dreams.” Being in community, connecting with
people, forced me to question everything. | saw us all
struggling in some way, some bearing far more agony
than others and | also felt fleeting moments of freedom.
