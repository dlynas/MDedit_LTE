Opinion: Why I’'m reS|gn|ng |
from the State Department

I can no longer continue what | was doing. |
hope that my resignation can contribute to
the many efforts to push the administration to
withdraw support for Israel’s war, for the sake
of the 2 million Palestinians whose lives are at
risk and for the sake of America’s moral
standing in the world.
