1. The US talks about Chinese “aggression” in the South
China Sea. This is like China complaining of US
aggression in the Gulf of Mexico. The presumption that
the US/NATO should by default control the most distant
waterways, preempting local governments in what
should be their spheres of influence, is both irrational
and white supremacist.

That a bunch of Europeans thousands of miles away
should control waterways surrounding Asian countries
because they can’t be trusted to manage themselves
should seriously give you pause.
