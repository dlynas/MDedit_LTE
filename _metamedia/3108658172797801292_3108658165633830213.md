â€˜,/ Holding Biden Accountable (From Th...

The Pentagon has failed 5 audits in a row and
the military industrial complex is a gang of

murderous thieves, so naturally Biden's doing
his best to enrich both while cutting spending

for the rest of us.

Military contractors overcharge the Pentagon on almost
everything the Department of Defense buys each year,
experts told 6 nutes over the course of a six-month

investigation into price gouging.

In March, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks
announced the largest Pentagon budget ever: $842
billion. Almost half will go to defense contractors.

Retired Air Force Lieutenant General Chris Bogdan,
who spent his career overseeing the purchase of some
of the country's most critical weapons systems, said
there's an inherent conflict between the Pentagon and
defense contractors.

Army negotiators also caught Raytheon
making what they called "unacceptable
profits" from the Patriot missile defense
system by dramatically exaggerating the cost
and hours it took to build the radar and

ground equipment.

In 2015, Assad ordered a review and army
negotiators discovered Lockheed Martin and its
subcontractor, Boeing, were grossly overcharging
the Pentagon and U.S. allies by hundreds of

millions of dollars for the Patriot's PAC-3 missiles.

Pentagon analysts found the total profits

approached 40%.
