FOKTHOSEGRIENING
GlaObalstlE RIS

Sacred Voice,

Release us from those empty cravings for unity that
come at no cost to the oppressor. Lead us toward
spaces of costly advocacy. We confess that in speaking
up on behalf of the oppressed, we too soon become
enamored with the sound of our own voices. Our egos
spoil even our best intentions. Show us when the voices
of the vulnerable are being drowned out by the
cacophony of the privileged. Help us to decenter
ourselves in a world that perpetually eclipses the voices
of the globally oppressed. Guide us into a solidarity
that demands something of us. Let us learn to risk
ourselves on behalf of the vulnerable, believing that
when one of us is harmed, we all are. But keep us
from that obsessive attunement which is prone toward
savior complexes and feigned allyship. Remind us that
we are not the heroes of every story.
