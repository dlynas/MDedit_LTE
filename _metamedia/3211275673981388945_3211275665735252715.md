This is only compounded by an abject failure to uplift
and celebrate the thousands of Palestinians who have
attempted to resist Israel's cruel domination through
non-violent protest. These include the 40,000
Palestinians who, weekly, participated in the Great
March of Return in 2018 demanding their right to
return to the homeland they were expelled from and
the end of the siege, only to be shot down like birds by
Israeli snipers. It includes the thousands of
Palestinians and their allies globally who have
engaged in boycott, divestment, and sanctions
campaigns aimed at isolating Israel and incapacitating
its lethal threat. It includes the civilian flotillas that
attempted to break the naval blockade of Gaza as well
as the multiple legal challenges within national courts,
the International Court of Justice, and now the
International Criminal Court. These efforts have not
only been marginalized by Western governments; they
have been demonized and smeared.
