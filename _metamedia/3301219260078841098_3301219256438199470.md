Don’t believe for a second that
dehumanization is only the
problem of the dehumanized.
They pay the unimaginable
cost, but this is a
multidirectional phenomenon.
To engage in dehumanization—
in thought, in speech, in action,
in policy—is a slow and isolating
exercise in the siphoning of
your own humanity.
