Despite Musk's claims, individuals entering the United States under this program
are doing so legally. And they are not eligible to vote. The notion that migrants are
voting in meaningful numbers is not grounded in fact. A study by the Brennan
Center for Justice evaluating 23.5 million votes across 12 states in 2016 found 30
incidents of suspected non-citizen voting, 0.0001% of the 2016 vote in those
jurisdictions. A 2022 audit of Georgia voting rolls found about 1600 noncitizens
attempting to register to vote over a 25-year period, and no non-citizens were

actually allowed to register or vote.
