â€œIsrael has the right to defend itself after

the Hamas attacks of October 7th"

Every country has the right to defend itself. However, as
an occupying force, Israel's position is offensive by
default. The Hamas attacks did not happen in a vacuum.
Prior to October 7th, Israel had continuously breached
international law, subjecting the Palestinians to a
perpetual state of vanquish and suffering. With the killing
of thousands of Palestinians, the demolition of tens of
thousands of homes, the theft of water and land, the
imprisonment of thousands without trial, and the harsh
restrictions on movement of people and commodities, it is
hard to imagine how the Palestinians would not fight back
to defend themselves.

Even if you believe Israel is "defending" itself after the
Hamas attacks, what do you think that entails? Is it
defending itself by collectively punishing a population of
more than 2 million people, by cutting off food, water, and
power, by indiscriminate bombarding with over 7000
missiles in 2 weeks, by murdering thousands of men,
women, and children, or by enforcing the displacement of
over a million citizens? Do these seem like the actions of a
state defending itself?
