Between 1953, the year the reparations
stipulated by the 1952 Israeli-West-
German Reparations Agreement came into
effect, and 1965, when Germany and Israel
formally established diplomatic relations,
West Germany was the only country to
provide Israel with all three common forms
of intergovernmental support: economic
aid via the Reparations Agreement, secret
military aid for war efforts, and a generous
financial grant agreed upon in 1960.
