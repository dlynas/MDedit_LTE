I don't want to get into it because it's another lecture but I'll just give the
three principles which enable us Israelis to live so easily with this brutal
reality. Most of the Israelis, if not all of them, deeply believe that we are
the chosen people and if we are the chosen people we have the right to do
whatever we want. B, there were more brutal occupations in history, there were
even longer occupations in history even though the Israeli occupation gets to
quite a nice record but there was never in history an occupation in Lutus,
occupier presented himself as the victim. Not only the victim, the only victim
around. This also enabled any Israeli to live in peace because we are the victims.
The other day, Professor Falk spoke about this dual strategy of Israel of being
a victim on one hand and manipulating the other on the other hand after what
happened in Paris and in Copenhagen with the terror attacks, Benjamin Etanya
came with the notion all the Jews must come to Israel, it's the safest place
for the Jews in the world, it's a shelter for the Jews in the world which is
wrong because Israel is today the most dangerous place on earth for Jews but
let's put it aside. It was only 24 hours later when Israel is an existential
threat under the Iranian bomb and I asked myself how can you dare call Jews to
come and to join this suicidal project when the Iranians are going to bomb us?
But in Israel everything goes and both decorations were accepted as
the only truth and here I get to the third set of values which enable us
Israelis to live in peace with the occupation and this is maybe the most
crucial one and the worst one. We say victimization, we say chosen people,
when I say victimization it goes without saying we have to mention the Holocaust
and the unforgettable Mrs. Golda Meir that the American jury had exported to
Israel she said once this unforgettable woman that after the Holocaust the Jews
have the right to do whatever they want but the third set of values is the
most dangerous one and this is the systematic dehumanization of the
Palestinians which enable us Israelis to live in peace with everything because
if they are not human beings like us then there is not really a question of
human rights and if you are scratch under the skin of almost every Israeli you
will find it there almost no one will treat the Palestinians as equal human
beings like us. I once wrote that we treat the Palestinians like animals and I
got so many protest letters from animal rights organizations rightly so but by
the end of the day how many Israelis did ever try for a moment to put
themselves in the place of the Palestinians for a moment for one day and I
want to give you two examples which will demonstrate it many years ago I
interviewed then candidate for Prime Minister Eud Barak and I asked him a
question which I try to ask in any occasion Mr. Barak what would have
happened if you would have been born Palestinian and Barak gave me then the
only honest answer he could give me he said I would have joined the terror
organization what else would have he done would he become a poet he doesn't
know to write poems would he become a pianist he's quite a bad pianist and I
doubt if he would have become a collaborator because he is a fighter and it
became a scandal because how can you dare to put Eud Barak to think what would
have happened if he would have become a Palestinian and the second incident
briefly secondly the father the city of Jainin the most close city in the West
Bank real total siege I go out from Jainin I come to the checkpoint a
Palestinian ambulances parking there with the red lights I stand after him no
cars can get out of Jainin in those days no cars can get in and I wait the
soldiers are playing bagamon in the tent usually I know I know myself it's
better that I don't get into confrontation with the soldiers because it always
ends up very badly so I stayed in the car but after 40 minutes I couldn't take
it and I went out to the car from the car I went first to the Palestinian
ambulance driver and asked he I asked him what's going on he told me that's the
routine they let me wait one hour until they come and check the ambulance and I
couldn't take it anymore and I went to the soldiers it became a confrontation but
the question that they asked that which really brought them to direct the
weapons toward me was one what would have happened if your father would have
been lying in this ambulance this freaked them out they lost control how can
I dare to compare between their father and the Palestinian in the ambulance and
this set of beliefs that they are not human beings like us and able us
Israelis to live in so much peace with those crimes ongoing crime for so many
years with losing any kind of humanity humanity values I heard today people
talk about Jewish values I must be frank with you I don't know what are Jewish
values I know what are universal values let's not get into it really
