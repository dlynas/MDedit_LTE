The same zeal was gripping schools in Berkeley. Zolt Hara learned from
another parent about an ethnic-studies class in which the teacher had
described the slaughter of some Israelis on October 7 as the result of friendly
fire. She saw a disturbing image that another teacher had presented in an art
class, of a fist breaking through a Star of David. (Officials at Berkeley High
School did not respond to requests for comment.) In her sonâ€™s middle school,

there were signs on classroom walls that read TEACH PALESTINE.
