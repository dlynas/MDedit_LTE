“The Jewish people deserve their own
safe homeland in direct response to the
Holocaust”

In 1917, the Zionist movement was able to convince
the British government to issue the Balfour
declaration, to consider Palestine a national home
for the Jewish people. This means that the Zionist
movement began the colonization of Palestine more
than a decade before the rise of Nazism in Germany
and its prosecution of European Jews. In any case,
the suffering of Jews at the hands of the Germans
does not justify their theft of Palestine and the
murder and expulsion of the Palestinians. Jewish
people, in particular, are expected to empathize with
populations that are oppressed and discriminated
against. Yet, Israel imposes these conditions on
millions under its authority, existing at the expense
of an indigenous population, discriminating against
those who are not Jewish.
