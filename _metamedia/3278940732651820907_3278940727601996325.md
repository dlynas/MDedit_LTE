7. Don’t be afraid to incorporate
humor, but balance it with romance.

8. Regularly put aside two hour
blocks of time—silence your phone
and put it in a drawer. Apply
yourself to a creative discipline. It’s
scary to start, but once you get
rolling those two hours will pass
quickly and you’ll have something to
show for it.

9. Never give up on a piece of
artwork, there is almost always
another deeper level to consider it
wherein it can be modified and
recontextualized to serve your will.
Take a break from that piece and
revisit with the goal to complete.
