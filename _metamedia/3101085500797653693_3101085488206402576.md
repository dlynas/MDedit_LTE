HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN ONE OF THOSE
SITUATIONS WHERE YOU DO SOMETHING AND
YOU'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHY?

YOU WALK INTO THE KITCHEN AND YOU EAT HALF

A PACK OF COOKIES EVEN THOUGH YOU WEREN'T

HUNGRY, AND YOU KIND OF DON'T EVEN REALISE
YOU'RE DOING IT UNTIL AFTER?

THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN WORKS ON MENTAL
HEURISTICS AND AUTOMATICITY.
