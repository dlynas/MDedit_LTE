Truth 7: Tit-for-tat human rights violations do not help
Israeli or Palestinian civilians. In the current context,
extreme forces win, ordinary people lose. Under
international humanitarian law, the crimes of one party
never justify the crimes of another party.

Truth 8: Anti-Semites use the Israeli military’s crimes
against Palestinians to incite hatred against Jewish
people. The Israeli government often uses accusations of
antisemitism as a shield against legitimate criticism. One
should not play into either narrative.
