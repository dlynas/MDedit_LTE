Alabama’s Supreme Court cleared to the
way for the state to become the first to
execute a person with nitrogen gas.

“The Alabama Supreme Court said the state can execute a
person on death row with nitrogen gas, a method that has
not previously been used carry out a death sentence.

The all-Republican court made its 6-2 decision without
comment on Wednesday. The justices granted the state
attorney general’s request for an execution warrant for
Kenneth Eugene Smith, one of two men convicted in the
1988 murder-for-hire slaying of Elizabeth Sennett in
northwestern Alabama.

The order did not specify the execution method, but the
attorney general indicated in court filings that it intends to
use nitrogen to put Smith to death. The exact date of the
execution will be set later by Gov. Kay Ivey.

Advocacy groups and lawyers representing individuals on
death row on Thursday criticized the decision, saying the
execution method is experimental and the state has not
disclosed adequate information about how it would work.”

If Alabama moves forward with the execution,
Kenneth Eugene Smith would be the first person in
the world to be executed with nitrogen gas.
