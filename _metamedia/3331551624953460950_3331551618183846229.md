Nothing to see here, just Doctors Without
Borders reporting Israeli airstrikes around
hospital, patients without care, mass arrests of
medical staff, and abuse of detainees by Israeli
forces.

Just another ordinary day of Israel’s war crimes
paid for with US-tax dollars.

~+ Doctors Without Borders / Médecins S... - 4h

MSF staff say heavy air strikes by Israeli forces and
fierce fighting continue around #AIShifaHospital in
#Gaza City, endangering patients, medical staff
and people trapped inside with very few supplies.
