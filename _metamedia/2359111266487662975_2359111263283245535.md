BILLIONARIRES TRULY DO
NOT GIVE A FUCK

It would cost $20 billion to end homelessness in the
US. Mike Bloomberg could do that tomorrow and still
have $28 billion to his name.

Halting global warming would cost $300 billion. The
world’s 10 richest people could each throw in $30
billion and still have $386 billion among themselves.

Many of us are only one really bad year — one
medical issue, one lost job — from complete financial
ruin. Absolutely none of us are one really good year
away from becoming billionaires.

They don't care about us. Don‘t cape for them, don’t
claim them, don’t defend the indefensible.
