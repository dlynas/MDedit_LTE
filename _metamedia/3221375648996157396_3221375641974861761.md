I don’t hesitate for a second to condemn the
killing of any child, any massacre of civilians. It
is the easiest ask in the world. And it is not in
spite of that but because of that I say: Condemn
the brutalization of bodies. By all means, do.
Condemn murder. Condemn violence,
imprisonment, all forms of oppression. But if
your shock and distress comes only at the sight
of certain brutalized bodies? If you speak out
but not when Palestinian bodies are besieged
and murdered, abducted and imprisoned? Then
it is worth asking yourself which brutalization is
acceptable to you, even quietly, even
subconsciously, and which is not.

Name the discrepancy and own it. If you can’t
be equitable, be honest.

There is nothing complicated about asking for
freedom. Palestinians deserve equal rights,
equal access to resources, equal access to fair
elections and so forth. If this makes you uneasy,
then you must ask yourself why.
