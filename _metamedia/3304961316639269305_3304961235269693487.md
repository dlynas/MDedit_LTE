On how success on social media
determines who gets book deals,
TV shows and record deals

Every publisher will ask a new author,
"What is your platform like? How big of a
platform do you have?" Which is almost a
euphemism for, "How many followers do
you have online?" â€” whether that's [on]
Twitter or Instagram or an email
newsletter. They want to know that you
already have an audience going into this
process, that you have a built-in fan base
for what you're doing. And culture
doesn't always work that way.
