Some faculty members were
disappointed by Gay’s
resignation.

On Tuesday, some faculty members
expressed deep dismay with what they
described as a political campaign against
Dr. Gay, Harvard and higher education
more broadly. Hundreds of them had
signed public letters asking Harvard’s
governing board to resist pressure to
remove Dr. Gay.
