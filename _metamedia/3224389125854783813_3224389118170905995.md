| support the refusal to condemn, and | will continue
speaking out against the hegemonic strategy of
instrumentalizing complexity to silence solidarity. But
complexity cannot always be equated with derailment.
Westerners without an experience of war or
displacement have denied my grief and equated it to a
form of “two-sideism”. | have seen white online activists,
many of whom are Germans or themselves colonisers in
the Americas, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand,
straight up deny or legitimise the massacres committed
by Hamas. | have seen people who | considered to be
my friends laugh and clap at the news of the massacring
of 260 people at a rave. | have seen colleagues repost
quotes calling Hamas “the most moral fighting force in
the world” - a sentence taken straight out of Israel's own
propaganda book. | have seen people use antisemitic
tropes to depict Israel as dominating the whole world,
instead of seeing it for what it is: a settler-colonial state
acting as a proxy to the US and Europe’s own imperialist
agendas.
