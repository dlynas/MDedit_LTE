We can show up for the Congolese people through,
educating ourselves, advocating for their humanitarian
aid, signing petitions, and donating to reputable
organizations, however the biggest most effective way we
can show up for them in this moment is by putting a
pause on our over consumption of electronics,
technology, and vehicles, which all use the materials that
people in Congo are currently being killed to produce.

While having access to communication devices and
computers may be necessary in todays world, it is not
necessary to constantly upgrade our devices in order to
have the newest models. When absolutely necessary to

purchase consider buying used.
