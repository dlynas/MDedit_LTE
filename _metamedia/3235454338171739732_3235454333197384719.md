Stop Cop City @JoshuaPHilll-14m

Cops doing one of their proud "look at the
stuff we confiscated" except it's gardening
tools for planting trees. Can't make this stuff
up.

@ Hannah Riley @hannahcrile...- 26m

In a press conference Atlanta Police
dramatically displayed gardening tools
taken from todays Block Cop City march
and said they were meant to “do harm”
but actually they were being used to
plant sapling native trees along the route
