[BIIEAKING]
THE SILENCE

The idea that we can "manage the conflict‚Äù
without ever having to solve it is once again
collapsing before our eyes. It held up until now
because only few dared to challenge it. These
heartbreaking events could change that. They
must. For all of us between the river and the sea.
