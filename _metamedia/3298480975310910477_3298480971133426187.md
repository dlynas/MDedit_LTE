@mercuryslim_ there actually are existing
anarchist communist projects with
millions of people democratically and
cooperatively managing their economies,
neighborhoods, and workplaces. Rojava
in Syria and the Zapatistas in Mexico. You
can very easily Google both, they are
amazing, resilient social experiments that
yielded the actual central demand of
workplace democracy and allowing the
people-- not a small Cadre of elites
usurping them in name only-- to run
society, as no "actually existing
socialism" has done. | know it conflicts
with your dogma, but it's not hard to
Google.
