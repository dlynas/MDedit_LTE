ONLY ONCE THE NEW HABIT HAS BEEN FORMED
AND SOLIDIFIED, COULD YOU RETURN BACK TO
YOUR LOCAL PUB, AND BE IN THE HABIT OF
ORDERING A NON-ALCOHOLIC DRINK INSTEAD OF
BEER.

OF COURSE, YOU CAN STICK TO THE ORIGINAL
PLAN AND ATTEMPT TRYING TO BREAK YOUR
HABIT LIKE THAT, BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE A LOT
MORE MOTIVATION AND YOU'D NEED TO OVERRIDE
YOUR EMOTIONAL BRAIN WITH LOGIC.

VISUALISING THE STEPS OF AN EVENT COULD
HELP IN ACHIEVING THIS TOO. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU
MENTALLY PRACTICE WALKING TO THE PUB, AND

ORDERING A NON-ALCOHOLIC DRINK KNOWING
THAT YOU'D BE TEMPTED BY THE BEER.
ACCOUNTING FOR SETBACKS MEANS WE CAN BE
BETTER PREPARED WHEN THEY ARISE.
