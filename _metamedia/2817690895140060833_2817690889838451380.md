"If a person cannot solve a conflict with a friend, how
can they possibly contribute to larger efforts for
peace? If we refuse to speak to a friend because we
project our anxieties onto an email they wrote, how
are we going to welcome refugees, immigrants, and
the homeless into our communities? The values
required for social repair are the same values
required for personal repair. And so this discussion

must begin in the most micro experience. Confusing
being mortal with being threatened can occur in any
realm. The fact that something could go wrong does
not mean that we are in danger. It means that we are
alive. Mortality is the sign of life.‚Äù
