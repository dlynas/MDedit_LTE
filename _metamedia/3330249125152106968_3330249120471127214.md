In case it’s not clear, US policymakers are doing
everything in their power to:

« prohibit funding to support starving
Palestinians

- prevent the applicability of international law on
Israel’s ongoing war crimes

- undermine oversight and enforcement of US
laws that prohibit our weapons being used for
human rights violations

Aid to Palestinians conditional on them not taking
Israel to court for human rights violations.

Aid to Israel *not* conditional on not committing
those human rights violations. x.com/
