Won’t someone think of the wealth hoarders?

Bentley CEO says sales
are down because the
rich are experiencing
‘emotional sensitivity’
due to the cost of living

and don’t want to flaunt
their wealth with a new
luxury car

Adrian Hallmark won't have to worry about
Bentley any more as he sets sails for
performance brand Aston Martin, where a
whole different set of challenges await.
