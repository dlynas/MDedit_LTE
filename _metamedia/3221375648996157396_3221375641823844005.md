Here is the truth of the diasporic Palestinians:
They are not magically diasporic. Their
diaspora-ness is a direct result of often violent,
intentional and illegal dispossession. One day a
house is yours; one day it is not. One day a
neighborhood is yours; one day it is not. One
day a territory is yours; one day it is not. This
same sort of dispossession is grounded in the
same mind-set and international complicity that
is playing out in Gaza.

I'm a poet, a writer, a psychologist. I'm deeply
familiar with the importance of language. I've
agonized over an em dash. I’ve spent afternoons
muttering about the aptness of a verb. I pay
attention to language, my own and others.
Being Palestinian in this country — in many
countries — is a numbing exercise in gauging
where pockets of safety are, sussing out which
friends, co-workers or acquaintances will be
allies, which will stay silent. Who will speak.
