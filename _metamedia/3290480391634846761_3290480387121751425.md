Number 1

For the first 5 years or so, whatever you do, you're
gonna suck.

But that's okay! Keep your head down and work work
work work on your craft.

Now obviously there are counter examples to this. Daft
Punk probably never sucked. The Weeknd’s first album
was flawless. But for the rest of us mere mortals,
chances are that in our early days, we're gonna be, in
graffiti terms, what they call a TOY.

But again, that's dope. First, it forces you to be
humble. And if you drill that into yourself properly,
that humility will never leave you. (Look at Pharrell.)

Second, when you suck is when you’re FREE. Absolute
freedom! You try, you experiment, you fail. Those are
the fun days. (The first Chromeo album SUCKS but boy
did we have a blast making it!) Cherish that. Cuz once
you get your shit right, it ain’t fun n games anymore,
the pressure is on!
