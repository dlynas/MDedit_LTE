In the spring of 1985 we padlocked the
front doors of Hamilton Hall, renaming it
Mandela Hall, and encamped on the
steps for three weeks. Columbia
divested from South Africa in the fall of
1985.

& Columbia Daily Spectator @ColumbiaSp r2
BREAKING: Dozens of protesters occupied Hamilton Hall
in the early hours of Tuesday morning, moving metal gates
to barricade the doors, blocking entrances with wooden
tables and chairs, and zip-tying doors shut.
