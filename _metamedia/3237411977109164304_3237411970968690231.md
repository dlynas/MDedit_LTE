While the answer is absolutely heartbreaking, it is
also simple. Society does not respect, cherish, or
value Black bodies. Although it is a degrading and
dehumanizing realization, it is understood by
Black and brown people that the part of us that is
most appealing to others is our pain and our
trauma. So while it was understood that he would
lose his life through this act, it was also
understood that the cries of the Congolese people
would continue to be overlooked unless he
provided the world with the trauma p**n of Black

bodies that they feast on.
