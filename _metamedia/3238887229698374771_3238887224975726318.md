Calla Walsh: Yeah. Well, we work with a wide variety of different tactics and collaborate
with many different groups, whether they're explicitly Palestine focused or not. We see the

interconnectedness between all these different struggles.

But like Max, I'm someone who's been involved in this Palestine solidarity movement for a

few years. I've done the lobbying, I've done the congressional advocacy, I've done the local

government advocacy. We've done boycotts, we've done petitions, we've done public ral

we've done mass marches. And it's not to say there isn't any value in those tactics. There

lies,

absolutely is. But this moment demands so much more. We're not just going to be politely

asking our senators and representatives to stop sending weapons to Israel. We are going to

ut our bodies on the line and say, we are stopping these weapons from going to Israel
we dare you to stop us.

And that'’s also part of an equation we have where we understand that the billions and

,and

illions of people in this world stand on the side of Palestine. And there is a very sma

minority group of extreme Zionists, imperialists, the US ruling class, who are the only

ecause this imperialist ruling class, because the US senators whose entire campaign

because these people suddenly wake up one day and have some moral awakening and
realize that what all of their material interests are invested in is bad. That’s just not goi

appen.
