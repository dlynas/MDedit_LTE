“I have broken more Elton John records, he
seems to have a lot of records. And |, by
the way, | don’t have a musical instrument.
| don't have a guitar or an organ. No organ.
Elton has an organ. And lots of other
people helping. No we've broken a lot of
records. We've broken virtually every
record. Because you know, look | only need
this space. They need much more room.
For basketball, for hockey and all of the
sports, they need a lot of room. We don't
need it. We have people in that space. So
we break all of these records. Really we do
it without like, the musical instruments.
This is the only musical: the mouth. And
hopefully the brain attached to the mouth.
Right? The brain, more important than the
mouth, is the brain. The brain is much
more important.”

—The 45th President of the United States,
July 5, 2018
