What Remains of life
Mahmoud Darwish
Translated by John Berger & Tania Tamari Nasir

If you were told: you're going to die here this evening What
would you do in the remaining time? Look at my watch Drink a
glass of juice Munch an apple Watch an ant who has found what
to eat Then look at my watch There’s still time to shave have a
bath I say to myself: One needs one’s finery when about to write
So I'll wear the blue shirt I sit til noon alive at my desk I do not
see the effect of color on words Whiteness whiteness whiteness
I prepare my last lunch I pour out wine into two glasses For me
and for the one who will come Unannounced Then I take a siesta
in between two dreams Yet the noise of my snoring will wake
me I look at my watch There is still time for reading I read a
chapter of Dante and a section of al Mualaqa and I realize how
my life Is about to leave me to stay with the living here And I do
not question what will fill the gap Like this? Like this like this.
Then what? I comb my hair and throw away the poem, this
poem, in the wastepaper basket I am wearing the most chic
Italian shirt. And in the company of Spanish violins I say
farewell to myself and walk toward the cemetery.
