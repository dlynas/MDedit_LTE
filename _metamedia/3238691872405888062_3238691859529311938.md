Profits of Israel’s weapons suppliers

USD 54 billion in a month and 10 days
18/11/2023

BOEING, USA

The company’s share price rose from USD 187.38
before the war to USD 206.6 today, a 10.2% profit
for investors at a value of USD 11.63 billion. Soon
after the war was declared, Boeing accelerated its
production, supplying Israel with 1,800 GPS systems,
with the aim of converting old missiles into guided
missiles. Boeing also rushed to provide Israel

with an emergency order of 1,000 smart missiles,
only four days after the declaration of war.
