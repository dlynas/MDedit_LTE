BILLIONAIRES
HOARD WEALTH

If you earned $50 million in your lifetime, you
would consider yourself rich... but you would still
be $950 million away from being a billionaire.

A billion is such an incomprehensibly large sum
of money that it'd be difficult to actually spend.
That's what we mean by “hoarding wealth.” There
is absolutely no reason why anyone should &%
hoard more wealth than they could spend 0
in their lifetime while others are N
homeless, starving, and

dying of curable diseases.
