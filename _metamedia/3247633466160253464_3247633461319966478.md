Q Lego Ahsoka thinks it's also very convenient for Apple
| to set their royalties only slightly higher than Spotify .
' despite having the margins to pay significantly more
’ (& take on less risk when operating at a loss) whereas
Spotify’s margins are razor thin. Likewise, (not even
taking into account other Apple revenue), an Apple
Music sub costs as much as a Spotify sub ($10.99/
month). Apple offers $0.01/stream (3.33x more than
Spotify), but Apple also only sees 13.7% of music
streaming market proportion (almost half of spotify’s
30.5%). This means that as a proportion* Apple Music
only pays 1.5x more than Spotify.

It's almost as if Apple realized they didn’t need outrun
the bear of public opinion, they just needed to outrun
Spotify.
