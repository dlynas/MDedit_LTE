An Update on Gaza:
What You Should Know
February 1.2024

“Displaced women living in deplorable
conditions are giving birth in plastic
tents and public buildings. Those who
manage to deliver in a hospital often
return to their makeshift shelters mere
hours after undergoing a caesarean.”

Per a report released by Doctors Without Borders on
January 29, “The humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza
has left expectant mothers without medical check-ups for
months, as basic healthcare services are virtually
unavailable and women in labor are unable to reach
hospitals because of the lack of fuel and capacity in the
few remaining hospitals.

Médecins Sans Frontieres teams are deeply alarmed by
the deteriorating lack of obstetric care in Gaza, caused
by the continuous bombings, restrictions on
humanitarian aid, and attacks on healthcare facilities.”
