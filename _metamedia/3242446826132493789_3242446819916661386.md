Helpful Context for Frustrating Conversations About Gaza //

“All of this violence started on
October 7th.”

Violence in Palestine has been ongoing since the creation
of the settler colony of Israel in 1948, which prompted the
mass displacement and dispossession of hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians—the Nakba.

Millions of Palestinians in both the occupied West Bank and
in Gaza have been subjected to relentless brutalization,
apartheid, ethnic cleansing, arbitrary detainment, and
crimes against humanity by the Israeli regime for 75
years.

In Gaza alone, Israel has killed at least 20,000 civilians
since the beginning of 2008; they have razed homes and
critical infrastructure, created a water crisis, and have
effectively caged millions of people into a nearly
uninhabitable strip of land which they bomb frequently.

October 7th was a violent day, yes. But October 7th was
certainly not the “start” of any violence—and to insinuate
otherwise reveals a deep lack of historical knowledge,

empathy for the daily lived reality of Palestinians, or both.
