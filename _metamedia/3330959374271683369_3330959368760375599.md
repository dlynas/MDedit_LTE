@99 @zei squirrel - 42m

the Jerusalem Post, an Israeli propaganda rag,
cites an Israeli general in a piece where they try
to get this State Department official fired, and
are so trapped in their depraved Zionist bubble
they don't realize they just confirmed their
systematic mass rape policy. Holy shit

@99 @zei squirrel-38m

that Israeli general said this on Israeli radio,
which is meant for domestic consumption,
complaining about those crazed extremist
Hamas-loving US State Department officials,
who do such evil things like cite UN reports
instead of just regurgitating Israeli regime
propaganda
