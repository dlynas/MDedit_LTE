Dear students,

We currently list you in the student administration
system with the nationality "Palastinensische
Gebiete" (Palestinian Territories). As a university, we
are obliged by the Hochschulstatistikgesetz (Law on
Statistics for Higher Education) to pass on certain
data of our students anonymously to the state
statistics office as part of the official university
statistics. This includes also the first and second
nationality. Due to changes in the statistical
requirements, "Paléstinensische Gebiete" may no
longer be used as a nationality in the next official
student registration, as this is not a clarified
nationality. Instead, the information "staatenlos*
(stateless) must be entered. We will make this
change in our student administration system in the
next few days. We kindly ask for your
understanding.

If the information about your citizenship was
incorrect or you have a different or additional
citizenship, you are welcome to provide us with
proof of this by means of an identity card/passport
and send it to the following e-mail address:
studierendensekretariat@ovgu.de. We will then
make the changes in the system.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any
questions.

Kind reagrds,
Your Student’s Office
