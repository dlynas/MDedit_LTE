Once a state or other entity commits genocide,
it must be destroyed. There’s no rehabilitation
or coexistence possible. Genocidaires and the
organizations they comprise are too dangerous
to be allowed to exist. There’s no other
defensible position. It’s a reasonable red line.

Just as there’s no safe number of fascists
(and it’s usually fascists we’re talking about,
of one kind or another), there’s no safe
number of genocidaires living freely in society.
Genocide must be fought, crushed—not
simply opposed. It must be pulled up by the
roots and burned.
