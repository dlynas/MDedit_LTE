One doesn't need to be a fortune-teller to
understand that the Israel-US game plan for
Gaza runs something like this:

1. In public, Biden appears “tough” on
Netanyahu, urging him not to “invade” Rafah
and pressuring him to allow more “humanitarian
aid” into Gaza.

2. But already the White House is preparing the
ground to subvert its own messaging. It insists
that Israel has offered an “extraordinarily
generous” deal to Hamas — one that,
Washington suggests, amounts to a ceasefire. It
doesn’t. According to reports, the best Israel
has offered is an undefined “period of sustained
calm”. Even that promise can’t be trusted.
