How it works

This simulation simulates three insurance firms in a simple setting that you -
the user - designs.

Insurable risks

You first establish the insurable risks. Every risk has two characteristics a
and b. a and b are calculated based on underlying random variables. If a
and b share a random variable they are correlated. The Riskprocess,
establishes the probability of an event of damage to occur, it should
dependent on characteristics of the risk. The damage, when its occurs is
always 100 pounds.
