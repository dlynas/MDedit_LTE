The US is picking a puppet government in
Jamaica where the leader has to support a UN
"security" invasion.

Not a great look.

Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley opened the
discussion. She laid out some of the key criteria for
being a member of the panel that will have
presidential powers: They cannot not run in the next
election. They cannot have been accused or convicted

of a crime. And they must support the multinational
security support mission to Haiti.

“Those serving on the presidential counsel will vouch
to support the U.N. resolution” for the mission “to
allow stability and security in Haiti,” Mottley insisted.
