I've spent a good chunk of my life chasing individual
goals, climbing ladders, and exhausting myself to
achieve arbitrary milestones. Beyond wanting to

access basic survival resources, | also had some
self-indulgent “dreams” of one day travelling the
world for my own pleasure or buying some “finer”,
bougie, non-essential things. | was socialized to
think that “happiness” would one day come from
me extracting more from the world. Ironically, such
self-centeredness could only ever lead to more
dissatisfaction & loneliness.

The most important shift political
awareness created in me is the desire
to dismantle individual goals and
replace them with collectivist goals.
