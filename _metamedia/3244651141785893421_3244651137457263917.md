On the level of religion and soul
development, human supremacies
lead to spirituality becoming an
individual, private, or small group
pursuit with no threat to broken
systems, no societal relevance.

Personally, I maintain my focus as a
ritualist on transforming human
supremacies through ancestral healing
because I view this style of human
confusion as the primary obstacle to
critical ecological corrections needed
by our beautiful, rowdy species.
