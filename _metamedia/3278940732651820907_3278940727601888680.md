4. Let your emotions guide the
medium. If you are a songwriter, let
your emotions guide the melody
into words. If you are a visual artist,
let your feelings enter into the lines
and colors.

5. Juxtapose things that you donâ€™t
think have been put together before.
Use the weight of one thing to
balance the other.

6. Freak yourself out. Be the
bravest version of yourself in your
artwork. What is brave to you surely
must be brave to some others. What
is embarrassing or vulnerable is
probably where the artwork is
hiding.
