HAVING LIVED IN THE UNITED
STATES FOR [SOME] YEARS,

I REALIZE THAT MUCH OF WHAT
I TRY TO EXPOSE IS ALREADY
BLATANT. THIS INDIFFERENCE
TO PALESTINIAN DEATH EXISTS
DESPITE MORALITY

AND “HUMAN RIGHTS.”
HUMANIZATION, MORE OFTEN
THAN NOT, DOES THE EXACT
OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT ALLEGES.
I NO LONGER FEEL THE
RESPONSIBILITY TO GIVE
HUMANS EYES FOR HUMANITY.
