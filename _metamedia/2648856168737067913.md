“Can you help me understand

"You're taking it the wrong

way.” what you thought when that
e "I didn't mean that.” happened? | want to
e "I meant well.” understand where this went

"
wrong.

"I was just trying to help.”

"I never intended to hurt you
and | can see that | did. Can |

¢ "It came from a good place.”

try to say that in a different
way? | want to try and explain
it better.”

"I know | was trying to do

@SITWITHWHIT

something good here, but it
didn't feel that way. I'm sorry
for X.”

"I want to be helpful and |

know what | just did wasn't
helpful. Can you help me
understand the best way to be
helpful?”
