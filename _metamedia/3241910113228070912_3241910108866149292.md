“Conflict” is an Israeli Narrative

Some people think “conflict” is a ‘neutral’
term, and use it to avoid adopting either the
Zionist or the Palestinian narrative.

But they are actually adopting a very
politically charged Israeli narrative.

Israel and its supporters falsely frame what’s
happening as a ‘conflict’ or ‘dispute’.
e E.g. Israel refers to the West Bank as a “disputed

territory”, instead of occupied, as it is officially
recognized by the rest of the world.

They do this because it legitimizes their demands
as equally valid to Palestinians’.

So when you say ‘conflict’, you are actually
pushing a political, pro-Israeli narrative.
