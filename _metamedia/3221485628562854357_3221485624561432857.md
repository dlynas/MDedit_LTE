IRONICALLY, ONE OF THE WORLD'â€™S
MOST LETHAL REGIMES DOES NOT
REQUIRE HUMANIZATION. THE WORLD
CAN GRIEVE ISRAELI LOSS

WITHOUT QUALIFIERS, DESPITE

THE DISPARITIES IN THE DEATH TOLL.
IN CONTRAST, WE MUST QUALIFY OUR
DEAD WITH REMINDERS OF THEIR
NONVIOLENCE, HUMANE PROFESSIONS,
AND DISABILITIES. A PALESTINIAN
MAN CANNOT JUST DIE. FOR HIM TO BE
MOURNED, HE MUST BE IN A
WHEELCHAIR OR DEVELOPMENTALLY
DELAYED, A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL,
OR NOTICEABLY ELDERLY AT THE VERY
LEAST. EVEN THEN, THERE ARE
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF
HIS VICTIMHOOD.
