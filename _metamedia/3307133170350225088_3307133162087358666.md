The 3rd Principle
—_— . S
by @laylafsaad

Change needs depth
and distance.

Change is both long overdue and an
intergenerational journey. We must
hold the urgency of change, and the
reality of how long it takes to create it.

Change must GO DEEP into the roots of
our personal, interpersonal, systemic,
and institutional oppression.

Change is a LONG-DISTANCE marathon
requiring sustainability, not just a

C HA N G E sprint requiring reactability. We must
do our best to take care of ourselves
and each other as we strive for depth
and distance.
