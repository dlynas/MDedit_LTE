Here’s another thing I know as a writer and
psychologist: It matters where you start a
narrative. In addiction work, you call this
playing the tape. Diasporically or not, being
Palestinian is the quintessential disrupter: It
messes with a curated, modified tape. We exist,
and our existence presents an existential
affront. As long as we exist, we challenge
several falsehoods, not the least of which is that,
for some, we never existed at all. That decades
ago, a country was born in the delicious,
glittering expanse of nothingness — a
birthright, something due. Our very existence
challenges a formidable, militarized narrative.

But the days of the Palestine exception are
numbered. Palestine is increasingly becoming
the litmus test for true liberatory practice.

In the meantime, Palestinians continue to be
cast paradoxically — both terror and invisible,
both people who never existed and people who
cannot return.

Imagine being such a pest, such an obstacle. Or:
Imagine being so powerful.
