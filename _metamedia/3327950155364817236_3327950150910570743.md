The Palestinians who aren’t dead by
Israhell’s genocidal, incessant bombing
campaigns or related injuries are being

insidiously starved to death. There’s

TR R e ST
people in your city who are unhoused and
F
d

ing from starvation, malnutrition,
from the brutality that these colonial/
capitalist systems have inflicted on them.

It just so happens that these systems are
killing some of us faster than others. And
that privilege might buy us some more
time but what life is that exactly? A
hollow, meaningless, guilt & shame filled
life severed from community and the
struggle? How can we sleep at night
knowing we are absolutely not doing
everything we can?
