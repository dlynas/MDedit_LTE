government has thought about dehumanization.
Unrelated but related, | posted this book
yesterday by Jasbir Puar, “The Right to Maim,”
which is all about how the Israeli state relies on
liberal frameworks of disability to obscure and
enable the mass debilitation of Palestinian
bodies. There are many examples of this, The
Great March of Return in 2018 is another great
example if you want to read more about it.

In short, please do the due diligence of doing
your research behind peoples claims especially
if you're sharing things others are posting. Even
me, fact check me! They silence us with
misinformation and try to derail our cause.
Liberation for all, Free Palestine.
