Right now it feels like the empire is leaning very hard on our tendency to dissociate and look away. Their actions in Gaza look like they’re torturing someone to death in the town square and looking us all dead in the eyes while they do it, trusting that we’ll turn our gaze away and submit. Butitisn’t working. People are looking more, not less. The western empire has never had more critical attention on it than it has right at this very moment.
