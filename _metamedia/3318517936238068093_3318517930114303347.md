An Update on Gaza:
What You Should Know
March7,2024

The U.S. has “quietly” approved and delivered
more than 100 military sales to Israel since its
genocide in Gaza began.

As reported on March 6 by The Washington Post, “The U.S.
has quietly approved and delivered more than 100 separate
foreign military sales to Israel since the Oct. 7, amounting to
thousands of precision-guided munitions, small-diameter
bombs, bunker busters, small arms and other lethal aid,
U.S. officials told members of Congress in a recent
classified briefing.

Only two approved foreign military sales to Israel have been
made public since the start of conflict: $106 million worth of
tank ammunition and $147.5 million of components needed
to make 155 mm shells. Those sales invited public scrutiny
because the Biden administration bypassed Congress to
approve the packages by invoking an emergency authority.

But in the case of the 100 other transactions, known as
Foreign Military Sales or FMS, the weapons transfers were
processed without any public debate because each fell
under a specific dollar amount that requires the executive
branch to individually notify Congress, according to U.S.
officials and lawmakers.”
