An Update on Gaza:
What You Should Know
February 1.2024

More than 75,000 housing units in Gaza
have been completely destroyed, with an
additional 290,000+ damaged by Israeli
airstrikes.

The United Nations has documented attacks on at least:

386 educational facilities 379 places of worship
11 bakeries 136 ambulances
199+ Gaza heritage sites 20 WASH facilities

All of which have been damaged or completely destroyed by Israeli airstrikes.

Only 14 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are partially functioning—
7 in the south and 7 in the north. The partially-functioning
hospitals in the south are currently operating at three
times their capacity.

Over 90% of school buildings in Gaza have sustained
significant damage. Currently, every single student in
Gaza has no access to education.
