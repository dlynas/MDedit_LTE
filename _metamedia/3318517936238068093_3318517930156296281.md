An Update on Gaza:
What You Should Know
March7,2024

The United States has airdropped
two rounds of “aid” into Gaza.

Over the weekend, the United States and Jordan airdropped 66
bundles of aid containing 38,000 meals into Gaza. On Tuesday,
the Pentagon announced a second airdrop with an additional
36,800 meals. (For context: 2.2 million people in Gaza are
facing crisis-level hunger.)

Notably, the amount of “aid” in each drop does not even amount
to two truckloads. Prior to the beginning of Israel’s genocide, the
amount of aid into Gaza was 500 truckloads—which was still
insufficient to address the needs of the people of Gaza.
