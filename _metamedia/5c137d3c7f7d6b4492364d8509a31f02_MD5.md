people in power that cash bail
doesn’t make people safe or improve
court appearance.
2 Outcome: government.
magically develops better
systems of pretrial care

attempt to uncover structural causes,
do public political education, come
up with strategies to build power to
fight entrenched opposition interests,
create interventions that reduce size
and power of opposing forces to
prevent against relentless
backsliding, constantly stay vigilant
because profit-seeking interests and
state bureaucracies always seek
more power.
> Outcome: Governments are
forced to address structural
inequalities, imbalances of
power, and systems of
pretrial care.

Strategy: Describe to the public and
people in power that body cams

them accountable, but they do
dramatically increase
police/prosecutor power, societal
surveillance, and corporate profit.
= Outcome: government
magically chooses not to
spend billions on police body
cameras and body camera
corporations voluntarily go
out of business.
