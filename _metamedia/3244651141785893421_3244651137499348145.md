On psychological, family, and
ancestral levels, systemic oppression
(which is pretty much always some
form or another of human supremacy)
reinforces old trauma, creates new
damage, and impairs deep healing.

With respect to group dynamics,
human supremacies divide natural
allies (e.g., working class people of
different religions or ethnicities), block
real solidarity, and allow the ruling
class to maintain the status quo.
