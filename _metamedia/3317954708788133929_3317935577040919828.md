If you want to know who you are, look at
who you are to others, and that should
give you a good picture, and if you donâ€™t
like that picture, then begin to make the
changes you need to, to make that picture
more in-line with who you want to be. You
are capable of change. You are capable of
growth, and most of our best growth
happens with others at our sides and in
our hearts, struggling together in the best
ways we can, letting real love lead the
way. Onwards towards liberation!
