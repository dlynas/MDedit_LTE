Fergie Chambers: So Palestine Action US is something thatâ€™s come into existence in the
last month. We had a relationship with Max. I've known Max for a long time because of
Palestine and because of Boston. And we had the link to the organizing going on in the UK.
We knew for a long time that Elbit was present in the US in New England, in Cambridge,
but the pieces hadn't really been put together. And perhaps the mass political moment
wasn't there in this country.

But when we decided to target the Elbit location in Cambridge on Oct. 12, it wasn't even as
Palestine Action anything. It was a couple of people who knew Palestine Action UK that had
connections to Cambridge deciding to target that building in the wake of what was
developing in Gaza.

And mind you, at this point... Well, the first major hospital bombing had not even occurred.
We had not seen 10,000 deaths. We had just seen the beginning. So we did a lockdown, we
hit the front of it with a lot of paint and messaging, and basically evaded arrest in that
instance. And in the wake of that, with the positive PR behind it, especially from the
Palestinian movement, from the feedback from the comrades in the UK, it felt appropriate to
launch the US campaign in the wake of that.

And since then, again, we're an affinity network. So it's not like us as the folks who were the

founding organizers are coordinating everything everyone does or telling people to go break

the law somewhere. We're an affinity network. We share ideas, we share an affinity for direct
action and an opposition to the occupation, and specifically this ongoing genocide. So people
have come up in that network, and at least half a dozen times that Cambridge location has

been targeted in one way or another.
