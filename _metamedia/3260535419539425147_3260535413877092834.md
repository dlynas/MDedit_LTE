People say ‘hurt people hurt people’, but being hurt
yourself is not an acceptable reason to hurt
someone else.

“Hurt people hurt people”, and hurt people are
accountable for the hurt they cause, and hurt people
are responsible for repairing and changing the

situation.

Experiencing trauma yourself does not give you
open license to cause trauma on someone else.

Don’t forget that.
