| really don't know what to say about this.

Holy shit.

e Urge Arab states to move beyond quiet talks and take
bolder steps toward normalization with Israel.

* Firmly reject the BDS movement, which singles out
Israel — home to millions of Jews — and too often veers
into anti-Semitism, while letting Palestinians off the
hook for their choices.
