o EE——————————
Created in the 1980s to supply the U.S. in
case of a regional war, the War Reserve
Stockpile Allies-Israel, or WRSA-I, is the
largest node in a network of what are
effectively foreign U.S. weapons caches.
Highly regulated for security, the
stockpiles are governed by a set of strict
requirements. Under circumstances laid
out in these requirements, Israel has been
able to draw on the stockpile, purchasing
the weapons at little cost if it uses the
effective subsidy of U.S. military aid.
