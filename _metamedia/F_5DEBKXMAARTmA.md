Israel’s military estimates it has killed
between 1,000 and 2,000 Hamas fighters
out of a military force it believes is about
30,000 strong. The country’s prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has
pledged to eliminate the group, but
Hamas remains a coherent fighting and
political operation able to negotiate over
hostages.
