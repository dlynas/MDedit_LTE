Capitalism
traumatizes us into a

lifetime of fight or
flight survival mode

Though none of us chose to be born, we are
forced into a world where life is nota human
right. Since birth, we are told we need to "earn‚Äù
theright to survive in a world where resources
are abundant but hoarded by a few.

Since birth, we are groomed, socialized and
assigned identities (based on luck) to ensure
that we willingly embrace the abuse and
violence of capitalism and aspire to merely fit
in rather than change our conditions.
