In other words ; humanity agreed
that no matter who you are and no
matter how much power you have,

you don’t have the right to oppress.

No matter how much modern
society promotes individualism, we
still are social beings, we don’t
survive without each other, it’s
important to understand that these
moral codes are the reason why we

survived and evolved.
