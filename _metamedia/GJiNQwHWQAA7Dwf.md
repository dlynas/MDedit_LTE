Because his job was to look for survivors,
he said, he kept moving and did not
document the scene. Neighbors of the two
girls killed — who were sisters, 13 and 16 —
said their bodies had been found alone,
separated from the rest of their family.

The Israeli military allowed the paramedic
to speak with reporters on the condition
that he not be identified because he serves
in an elite unit. [Update: March 25, 2024:
Newly released video viewed by The Times
showed the bodies of two teenage girls in
Kibbutz Be’eri fully clothed, undercutting
this account from an Israeli military
paramedic who recovered bodies in
multiple locations after the Oct. 7 attack. It
was unclear if the paramedic was
describing bodies he discovered
elsewhere.]
