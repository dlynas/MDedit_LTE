In an interview with the Ynet news website on May 5, 2019,
Netanyahu associate Gershon Hacohen, a major general in
reserves, said, “We need to tell the truth. Netanyahu’s strategy is
to prevent the option of two states, so he is turning Hamas into
his closest partner. Openly Hamas is an enemy. Covertly, it’s an
ally.”

In a tweet on May 20, 2019, Channel 13 quoted Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak saying: “Netanyahu isn’t interested in the two-
state solution. Rather, he wants to separate Gaza from the West
Bank, as he told me at the end of 2010.” Mubarak said that during
an interview with the Kuwaiti daily Al-Anba.
