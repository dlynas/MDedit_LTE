"For us consumers, they are making us
more passive just by feeding us so much
stuff, by constantly recommending
things that we are unlikely to click away
from, that we're going to tolerate [but]
not find too surprising or challenging,"
Chayka says.

What's more, Chayka says, the
algorithms pressure artists and other
content creators to shape their work in
ways that fit the feeds. For musicians
working through Spotify or TikTok, this
might mean recording catchy hooks that
occur right at the beginning of a song â€”
when a user is most likely to hear it.
