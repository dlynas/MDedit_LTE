BILLIONRIRES AREN'T
ACTUALLY CHARITABLE

Jeff Bezos made headlines for donating $100 million to
Feeding America in April. He makes $215 million a day.

Bill Gates donated $589 million to charity in 2019. That's
0.6% of his $98 billion net worth. His foundation is also a
neocolonialist nightmare for many reasons (google this)

But even if it's just a tiny fraction of their net worths, arenâ€™t
hundreds of millions of dollars still doing good?

No, because that wealth they're donating came directly from
exploiting the poor. Throwing a teeny fraction of the money
they stole back to charity doesn't erase that. Billionaires*
existence reinforces the conditions necessary for extreme
poverty to exist in the first place, and vice versa.
