other institutional spaces where Palestinians
went unnamed or were referred to only as
terrorists. I came of professional age in a
country where people lost all sorts of things for
speaking of Palestine: social standing,
university tenure, journalist positions. But in
the end, I am undone not by silence or erasure
but by empathy. By the simple naming of my
people. By increasing recognition that liberation
is linked. By spaces of Palestinian-Jewish
solidarity. By what has become controversial:
the simple speaking aloud of Palestinian
suffering.

These days, everyone is trying to write about
the children. An incomprehensible number of
them dead and counting. We are up at night,
combing through the flickering light of our
phones, trying to find the metaphor, the clip, the
photograph to prove a child is a child. It is an
unbearable task. We ask: Will this be the image
that finally does it? This half-child on a rooftop?
This video, reposted by Al Jazeera, of an
inconsolable girl appearing to recognize her
mother’s body among the dead, screaming out,
“It’s her, it’s her. I swear it’s her. I know her from
her hair”?
