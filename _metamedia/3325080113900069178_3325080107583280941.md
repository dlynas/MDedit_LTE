Divine Protector,

Remind us that our bodies are sacred. The stories
weâ€™ve inherited, of both beauty and trauma, rest on
our bones. We have known what it is to have our
physical agency stolen from us. We have known
what it is to have our bodies used more than loved.
And each day, capitalism demands we sacrifice blood
and muscle at its altar. We betray our physical
selfhood to survive, yet leaving it behind is a greater
death still. As we long for justice and deeper
liberation, train us to listen well to our flesh; that
we would make, eat, drink, rest, weep, stretch, move
in freedom, knowing that our bodies are not enemy
but sacred guardians of our glory.

May it be so.
