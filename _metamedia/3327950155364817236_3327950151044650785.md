I’'ve had to be honest with myself, look in
the mirror over & over again. “Am I doing
everything I can do in this moment to be
a part of the struggle? To help folks that
are most in need?” It’s uncomfortable. But
do it anyways. If you were really honest
with yourself, what resources do you have
that you can give away and redistribute
regularly? Any money left over on a
weekly, monthly basis that could simply
be given to unhoused folks & people in
your local context that are most in need?

How can you resist the urge to hoard
money for yourself? Because it is costing
you your humanity. If we’re completely
honest with ourselves, what is stopping us
from pooling resources & being more
committed to the struggle, dedicating
ourselves to the care of the marginalized
in our communities & to caring for each

other, from trying to feed the hungry;
house the unhoused?
