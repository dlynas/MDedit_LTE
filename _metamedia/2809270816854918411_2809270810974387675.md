"...who paternalistically
feels that he can set the
timetable for another man's
freedom; who lives by the myth of
time; and who constantly advises
the Negro to wait until a "more
convenient season." Shallow
understanding from people of good
will is more frustrating than
absolute misunderstanding from
people of 111 will. Lukewarm
acceptance is much more
bewildering than outright
rejection. ‚Äù

From Martin Luther King's
Letter from a Birmingham Jail
