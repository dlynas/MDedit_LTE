The Iron Wall

Original in Russian, Razsviet, 4.11.1923

Colonisation of Palestine
Agreement with Arabs Impossible at present

Zionism Must Go Forward

It is an excellent rule to begin an article with the most important point. But
this time, I find it necessary to begin with an introduction, and, moreover, with a

personal introduction.

I'am reputed to be an enemy of the Arabs, who wants to have them ejected

from Palestine, and so forth. It is not true.

Emotionally, my attitude to the Arabs is the same as to all other nations —
polite indifference. Politically, my attitude is determined by two principles. First of
all, I consider it utterly impossible to eject the Arabs from Palestine. There will
always be fwo nations in Palestine — which is good enough for me, provided the Jews
become the majority. And secondly, I belong to the group that once drew up the
Helsingfors Programme, the programme of national rights for all nationalities living
in the same State. In drawing up that programme, we had in mind not only the Jews ,

but all nations everywhere, and its basis is equality of rights.

I am prepared to take an oath binding ourselves and our descendants that we
shall never do anything contrary to the principle of equal rights, and that we shall

never try to eject anyone. This seems to me a fairly peaceful credo.

But it is quite another question whether it is always possible to realise a
peaceful aim by peaceful means. For the answer to this question does not depend on
our attitude to the Arabs; but entirely on the attitude of the Arabs to us and to

Zionism.
