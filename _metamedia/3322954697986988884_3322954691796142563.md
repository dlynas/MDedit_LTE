o, Many kibbutz residents raged when the 1
remaining Palestinian house not bulldozed to
create Nir Oz hosted an exhibit on the refugees
it expelled to Gaza, but Efrat Katz was moved
to leave a touching note expressing her
solidarity; 4 years later, on October 7, Israel
shot her dead

Efrat Katz RIP: “I feel the need and the
hope to return to the land and revive it with
the past emotions, to revive it with the
culture and habits of [the Palestinians
ethnically cleansed in 1948]... There’s no
room for deportation. My heart is

with you.” bit.ly/efratkatz
