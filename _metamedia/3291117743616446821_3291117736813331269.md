Israeli officials originally told the press that they
obtained intel about the 12 former UNRWA
employees — 7 teachers, a custodian and other
ground level staff — through interrogation of
detainees. Because Israel has long been
criticized by human rights groups for abusing
and torturing detainees, the optics of that
explanation were awkward in the West.

Now Israel is telling the NYT they got the info
through surveillance.

The Times ran that new explanation without
even mentioning the original one.
