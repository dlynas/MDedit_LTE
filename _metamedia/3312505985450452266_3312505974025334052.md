Hey so | am not Palestinian an am in no position to endorse
or condemn Hamas' actions. That being said, neither are
most people, and there are a lot of very confidently ignorant
opinions being thrown around.

There are no Israeli â€œcivilians" or tourists who have no part
in the oppression of Palestine. That idea doesn't make any
sense and betrays a lack of understanding of what the
oppression of Palestine even is. Israel is a settler colonialist
apartheid state. All of its residents or their immediate
forebears have moved there specifically to settle on stolen
land. Land whose people are being cornered and cleansed
just a few miles away, or right next door in the case of the
West Bank. There are no Israelis without the genocide of the
Palestinian people.

To bring this into stark relief, there is the example of the music
festival which the liberal states and media have made such

a point of clutching their pearls over. "A music festival! How
could it get more innocent than a music festival!?" That music
festival was happening just three miles from Gaza, within site
of the border wall. Imagine a similar event happening in the
early days of the colonization of North America. Can you or

| really say that Indigenous people are wrong for retaliating
against colonizers who are rubbing their domination in their
face?
