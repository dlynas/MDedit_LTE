I've raised this issue several times. If
this really is about academic integrity,
how can those celebrating Gay's
resignation not be calling for this as
well?

If we’re going to start scrutinizing every
detail of college presidents’ past
writings for technical attribution
issues, then let’s do it. Let’s go look at
everyone’s past writings, not just
Claudine Gay at Harvard. Let’s put
them all under a microscope and see
how they hold up.
