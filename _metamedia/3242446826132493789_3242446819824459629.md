Helpful Context for Frustrating Conversations About Gaza //

“This is a war between Israel and Hamas;
not agenocide.”

There is a war taking place-but it is certainly not Gaza’s war, nor is
it even Hamas’ war. Israel—one of the most well-funded militaries
in the world with the full backing of the U.S. government—has
waged a full-scale war on one of the most densely populated
places in the world, where V2 of the population is children.

The asymmetry between the Israeli occupation forces and Hamas
is painfully clear—Israel drops American-made bombs while
Hamas fights with locally-constructed weapons.

Many experts and scholars agree that what is unfolding in Gaza is
genocidal. For example:

Craig Mokhiber, a director at the United Nations, resigned from
his position over the UN’s failure to act against what he called a
“textbook case of genocide" in his resignation letter. Raz Segal,
an Israeli expert in modern genocide, wrote in Jewish Currents,
“Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza is quite explicit, open,
and unashamed.” Luis Moreno Ocampo, the inaugural chief
prosecutor of the International Criminal Court noted that “Just the
blockade of Gaza—just that—could be genocide under
Article 2(c) of the Genocide Convention.”

As human rights attorney Rabea Eghbariah asked in his piece for
The Nation, “does one have to wait for a genocide to be
successfully completed to name it?’
