"Israel has consistently made generous
peace offers which were rejected by the
Palestinians‚Äù

As the superior power, Israel signed an inequitable
peace accord with the Palestinians in 1993. Despite its
unfairness, the Palestinians accepted all Israeli and
US dictates (including only 22% of historical
Palestine) while Israel did not concede anything in
return (it did not withdraw from the occupied
territories, did not allow the return of refugees, and
did not accept the substantive human right of self-
determination for the Palestinians). The accord was
to be implemented within five years. Since then,
Israel multiplied its illegal Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, expropriated land and water resources,
added more than 500 checkpoints, imprisoned
thousands of Palestinians without a trial process, and
took every step to deny the Palestinians their own
statehood. This behavior raises questions about the
sincerity of the supposed generous offers.
