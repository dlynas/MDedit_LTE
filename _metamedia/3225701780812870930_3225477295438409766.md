“Jewish people have existed in the
land long before Palestinians, making
them its rightful owners”

To justify the appropriation of land, and
the expulsion and elimination of its
people, Zionism as a European settler-
colonial movement has tried to deny the
existence of the Palestinians altogether.
Before the British Mandate on Palestine
and the Balfour declaration, Jews in
Palestine constituted only 4% of the
population. Jewish claims that they
inhabited Palestine 2000 years ago are
irrelevant and do not justify the theft of
land and the murder and expulsion of the
Palestinians.
