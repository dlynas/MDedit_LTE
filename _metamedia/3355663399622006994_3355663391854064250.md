SIX LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS
OCCUPATIONS

1. The police lie. Their scripts and timelines are made
up, hour by hour. None of their promises will be kept.

2. The university administration lies. Whatever promises
it makes are designed only to stop you from acting.

3. Anyone who is wearing a yellow vest or holding a
megaphone just bought one at Home Depot. They do
not have any more experience than you and they do not
know any better than you.

4. Instead of blindly following self-appointed marshalls
and organizers, think critically about where their
commands will lead you. Are they making you smarter
and braver, or are they trying to scare you into
complying with the police and the university
administration?

5. Anyone who tries to get you to de-scalate is selling
out the people of Gaza. (De-escalation could look like
tearing down your own encampment, and making
concessions to the university.)

6. You and your friends can get away with a lot if you
are brave and look out for each other. You can escalate
and expand the struggle.
