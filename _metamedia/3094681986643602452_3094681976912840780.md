ﬁ JEWS FOR RACIAL &
ECONOMIC JUSTICE

The devastating, violent killing of #JordanNeely
reflects so much about what is broken in our city:

The inadequacy of quality & accessible mental
healthcare. The cost of food and rent that leaves so
many New Yorkers hungry and without a safe place

to sleep. The unprocessed mass grief & trauma of
the pandemic that still has us all on edge, whether
we know it or not. The dehumanizing and fear-
mongering headlines. The harsh statements from the
mayor that tell us anyone behaving out of the
ordinary or who looks like they're struggling is

violent and dangerous.
