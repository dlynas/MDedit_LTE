In a world with depravity like
colonialism/ Zionism, doing
NOTHING does not make you the
good guy. The systems we live under
are killing people everyday. Millions
if not billions of people have been
massacred by colonialism, capitalist
exploitation, state violence forcing
starvation/ malnutrition, in
incarceration, at the hands of the
police, imperial militaries/ armies.

Telling yourself to turn away, look
away, keep focusing on your job, on
your career, on that next deadline, on
your goals.. that makes you an active
enabler & supporter of these brutal

violent systems decimating the most
marginalized.
