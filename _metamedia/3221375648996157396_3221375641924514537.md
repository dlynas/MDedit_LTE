we’ve seen in the past two weeks, is to audition
for empathy and compassion. To prove that we
deserve it. To earn it.

In the past couple of weeks, I've watched
Palestinian activists, lawyers, professors get
baited and interrupted on air, if not silenced
altogether. They are being made to sing for the
supper of airtime and fair coverage. They are
begging reporters to do the most basic tasks of
their job. At the same time, Palestinians fleeing
from bombs have been misidentified. Even
when under attack, they must be costumed as
another people to elicit humanity. Even in death,
they cannot rest — Palestinians are being
buried in mass graves or in old graves dug up to
make room, and still there is not enough space.
