= "FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA, THERE
WILL ONLY BE ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY."

These are the words of the the current ruling
party of Israel--the Likud--in its original platform
from 1977. It further declared its opposition to
any Palestinian state and that all of Israel
belongs to j√©ws only. If you do their math, this
means no Palestinians! The genocidal intent was
always theirs.

The Palestinian refrain, 'From the river to the
sea, Palestine will be free,' is a response to
Israel's original (and continuing) genocidal
intentions! But unlike the Likud, Palestinians use
it to mean liberation of their people, not
genocide of their enemies.

IOW: Zionist Projections Are Zionist
Confessions!
