9. Rafah will be destroyed, leaving the entire
strip in ruins, and the Israeli-induced famine will
worsen. The West will throw up its hands, say
Hamas brought this on Gaza, agonise over what

Arab countries — for a “humanitarian plan” that
relocates the survivors out of Gaza.

terms, as though this “disaster” was an act of
God.

of Justice, or World Court, will be in no hurry to
issue a definitive ruling on whether South
Africa’s case that Israel is committing a
genocide — which it has already found
“plausible” —is proved.
