Just this week, official Israeli government
accounts have tweeted, then deleted, the
following:

- Video of a fake nurse claiming that Hamas
took over the Al-Shifa hospital

- False claim that “AP, CNN, NY Times, and
Reuters had journalists embedded with
Hamas terrorists on October 7th massacre”

- Video with fake captions claiming a crying
elderly Gaza woman blames Hamas for the
siege

- Graphic asserting Israeli ownership of all the
occupied territories, including Syria’s Golan
Heights

- False claim that Israel is “facilitating the
supply of humanitarian aid to Gazan civilians.”

- Assertion that hospitals and ambulances
constitute "legitimate military targets."
