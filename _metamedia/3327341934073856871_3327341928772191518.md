1. Lately | have been paying more attention to
the groups of my fellow Jews who are
describing themselves as persecuted because
of the global objections (by other Jews and the
rest of the world) to the brutal slaughter in
Gaza.

2. These people include the 400 who signed a
petition against Jonathan Glaser, to a Zionist
right-wing journalist who spoke at the 92nd
StY, to an Atlantic writer to a student from
'â€˜Bears for Israel" claiming that people are
yelling at her because they are anti-semitic.

3. What all these people have incommonis a
strange childishness- an inability to imagine
that they could be part of anything wrong. A
total inability to be self-critical.
