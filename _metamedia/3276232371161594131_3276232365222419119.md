This felt like a huge betrayal. But it was a
necessary betrayal, because my
grandpa'’s vision of Israel was false from
the start. It capitalized on my his identity
as a Jew, and his pride in playing a role in
the struggle against widespread
antisemitism and violence. It is repulsive
and manipulative how Israel uses legacies
like my grandpa'’s to retain the support of
American Jews who are one, two, and
three generations away from the struggle
against nazi Germany.
