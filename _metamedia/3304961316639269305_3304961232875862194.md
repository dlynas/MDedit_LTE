If you opened Facebook, Twitter or
Instagram about a decade ago, you'd
likely see posts from friends and
family, in chronological order.
Nowadays, users are hit with a barrage
of content curated by an algorithm.
Passionate about plants? Sports? Cats?
Politics? That's what you're going to
see.

In New Yorker writer Kyle Chaykaâ€™s new
book, Filterworld, Chayka examines the
algorithmic recommendations that
dictate everything from the music,
news and movies we consume, to the
foods we eat and the places we go. He
argues that all this machine-guided
curation has made us docile consumers
and flattened our likes and tastes.
