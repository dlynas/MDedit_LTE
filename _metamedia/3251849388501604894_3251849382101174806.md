Arabs Not Fools

This is equally true of the Arabs. Our Peace-mongers are trying to persuade us
that the Arabs are either fools, whom we can deceive by masking our real aims, or
that they are corrupt and can be bribed to abandon to us their claim to priority in
Palestine , in return for cultural and economic advantages. I repudiate this conception
of the Palestinian Arabs. Culturally they are five hundred years behind us, they have
neither our endurance nor our determination; but they are just as good psychologists
as we are, and their minds have been sharpened like ours by centuries of fine-spun
logomachy. We may tell them whatever we like about the innocence of our aims,
watering them down and sweetening them with honeyed words to make them
palatable, but they know what we want, as well as we know what they do not want.
They feel at least the same instinctive jealous love of Palestine, as the old Aztecs felt

for ancient Mexico , and their Sioux for their rolling Prairies.

To imagine, as our Arabophiles do, that they will voluntarily consent to the
realisation of Zionism. In return for the moral and material conveniences which the
Jewish colonist brings with him, is a childish notion, which has at bottom a kind of
contempt for the Arab people; it means that they despise the Arab race, which they
regard as a corrupt mob that can be bought and sold, and are willing to give up their

fatherland for a good railway system.

All Natives Resist Colonists

There is no justification for such a belief. It may be that some individual Arabs
take bribes. But that does not mean that the Arab people of Palestine as a whole
will sell that fervent patriotism that they guard so jealously, and which even the
Papuans will never sell. Every native population in the world resists colonists as
long as it has the slightest hope of being able to rid itself of the danger of being

colonised.
