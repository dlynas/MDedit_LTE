This is a very sincerely felt aspect of Palestinian nationalism with a lot of

support in the broader Arab world but also in a practical sense obviously
a huge barrier to peaceful diplomatic settlement.

@ HAYDAR @chronicalihere - May 15

When Palestinians were forced out into exile during the Nakba, many kept the
keys to their homes. They still have those keys to this day— passing it down

with each generation— the belief is that strong in that they will return; that it's
promised and only a matter of time.
