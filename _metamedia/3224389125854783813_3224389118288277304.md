| don’t believe that nation states will ever free us. | believe
that freedom and justice are actions and not a goal. As
Ursula K. Le Guin said: “The end justifies the means. But
what if there never is an end? All we have is means.”
Liberating ourselves and each other is achieved by
activists on the ground, by talking to your friends, your
neighbours, organising your workplace, by direct action,
mutual aid, by joining in co-resistance against the state
and all the oppressive systems that govern our lives. Even
and especially when feeling grief, fear, and shock; our
solidarity now and always has to be with the oppressed,
the persecuted, the displaced - with Palestine.

For two days, Gaza was cut off from the world due to the
bombardments hitting communication services and their
electricity being switched off. Every person in Gaza was in
the dark, and unable to correspond with the outside world.
We must not rely solely on their testimonies and on the
presence of their pain online to support them — we have to
raise our own voices.

Stop the genocide in Gaza now!
