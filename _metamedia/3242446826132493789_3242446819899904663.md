Helpful Context for Frustrating Conversations About Gaza //

“The majority of those killed in Gaza

were ‘terrorists’.”

In an interview with Sky News, former Prime Minister of
Israel, Yair Lapid, said that the majority of those killed by
Israeli Occupation Forces in Gaza were “terrorists”. He
provided no facts to back this statement up.

For perspective: More than 14,500 people-including
more than 6,000 children and 4,000 women-have been
killed in Gaza since October 7. At least 35,000 have
been wounded and an additional 7,000 are missing
and likely under rubble.

Israeli officials, on the other hand, have yet to provide a
figure of how many Hamas fighters the IOF has killed since
their war on Gaza began.

We must truthfully ask ourselves: who defined “terrorism” in
this case? The United States, which has inflicted terror on
countless countries around the world, and Israel, which is
currently terrorizing 2.3 million people in Gaza. Who holds
the moral authority to call resistance to decades of brutal
occupation “terrorism”?
