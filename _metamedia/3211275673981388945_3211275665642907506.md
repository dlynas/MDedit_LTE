Hamas’ attack should make clear that the problem is
not the Palestinian people’s insatiable thirst for
freedom but an international status quo that has aimed
to normalize Israel's permanent subjugation of
Palestinians. This crisis and looming war must be
understood as more than a hostage situation of
significant magnitude. It is a crisis of political will to
challenge the war crimes and crimes against humanity
committed by Israel which have led us to this point.
Ongoing failure to properly contend with this context is
tantamount to telling Palestinians that they must die
quietly. This is an immoral and impossible demand
that threatens far more than Palestinian life. Any
condemnation of Palestinian violence now must begin
and end with demands to lift the siege, end the
occupation, and dismantle Israel’s apartheid system.
