WHO GETS PAINTED AS ‘“‘VIOLENT’> AND
WHY? WHO CONTROLS THAT LANGUAGE
AND NARRATIVE? LANGUAGE IS POWER.
PALESTINIANS AND MUSLIMS ARE
‘““TERRORISTS,”” BLACKS ARE
‘“CRIMINALS,”” NATIVES ARE ‘“‘SAVAGES.”
THOSE IN POWER ARE THE ‘“SAVIORS’> AND
‘““DEFENDERS.”” THE OPPRESSOR HAS THE
‘““RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE’> (FROM WHAT?)
WHILE THE OPPRESSED ARE ‘“VIOLENT”’ IF
THEY RESIST OPPRESSION. THE MEDIA IS
THE BIGGEST TOOL USED TO MAINTAIN
THESE NARRATIVES & OPPRESSION.
