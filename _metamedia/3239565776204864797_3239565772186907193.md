Convention wisdom tells us that Jewish Israelis and
Palestinians canâ€™t live together. The hate is too deep. The
differences are irreconcilable. We are told that Jewish Israelis
support genocide, and Palestinians support terrorism. Violent
repression and resistance are the only options.

Abed and Green, co-workers who are also comrades, provide
evidence that the conventional wisdom is wrong; these are not
the only options. Standing Together provides evidence that a
different future is possible.

For too long, the public conversation in the United States about
Israel-Palestine has been focused on the wrong things. Identity
and ideology have been centered. Are you a Zionist? Do you
support decolonization? Should we call it apartheid? Do you
condemn terrorism? Kidnapping? Bombing? Is that
antisemitism? Islamophobia?
