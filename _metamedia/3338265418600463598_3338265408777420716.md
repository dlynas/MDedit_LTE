This attack was meant as a threat for the rest of us
btw. You’re against the israeli government? The
guillotine is waiting for you.

Israel didn’t just target the World Central Kitchen
workers once. The survivors of the first drone attack got
into another car and were attacked again. The survivors
of the second attack were finally killed in a third vehicle.
There’s nothing unintentional about this.
