When atrocities like genocide are
allowed to happen, we render these
moral codes obsolete. We give our
consent to create a world where
mjustice 1s normalised.
And if 1t 1s allowed to happen to
someone else, 1t will be aloud to
happen to you too, the moment
power dynamics change.

And they always change.
