Since 1967, Israel has exercised full control of
Gaza’s 43km coastline and territorial waters,
blocking ships from reaching the city. Gaza
seaport is the only Mediterranean port closed
to shipping, because of Israeli colonization and
continued destruction.

Between 1967 and 1994, the existing
infrastructure was severely neglected.
Railways, air and seaports were no longer at
the free disposal of Palestinians and were
only there to serve Israel, its army and its
settlers.
