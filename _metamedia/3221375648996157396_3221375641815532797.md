Take it from a writer: There is nothing like the
tedium of trying to come up with analogies.
There is something humiliating in trying to earn
solidarity. I keep seeing infographics
desperately trying to appeal to American
audiences. Imagine most of the population of
Manhattan being told to evacuate in 24 hours.
Imagine the president of [ ] going on NBC and
saying all [ ] people are [ ]. Look! Here’s a strip
on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea. That’s
Gaza. It is about the same size as Philadelphia.
Or multiply the entire population of Las Vegas by
three.

This is demoralizing work, to have to speak
constantly in the vernacular of tragedies and
atrocities, to say: Look, look. Remember? That
other suffering that was eventually deemed
unacceptable? Let me hold it up to this one. Let
me show you proportion. Let me earn your
outrage. Absent that, let me earn your memory.
Please.
