Truth 1: Israel’s military has a long history of using
excessive force against Palestinians with impunity. It can
certainly take action to prevent rocket attacks from Gaza
but does not have a right to commit war crimes in the
process. One should not make excuses for these crimes.

Truth 2: Hamas has a long history of indiscriminately
attacking civilians. Lobbing rockets into Israeli populated
areas is a war crime. Hamas is also committing torture
against its own people and repressing dissent. One
should not make excuses for that either.
