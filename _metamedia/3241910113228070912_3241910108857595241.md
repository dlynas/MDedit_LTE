How This Impacts Policy

If it was a conflict over land and power, then ending
it, and everything it entails (the blockade on Gaza, the
occupation, apartheid, settlements, human rights
abuses) would be conditional on getting both
Israelis and Palestinians to agree.

But these things are not and should never be conditional on
the comfortable agreement of the oppressor. Apartheid and
occupation need to end immediately and unconditionally,
not only when it suits Israel’s interests and not only through
“peaceful negotiations” but by any means necessary,

including military resistance.

Imagine calling to end South African apartheid only
as long as it suits the apartheid regime, or to stop
the Rwandan Genocide only as long as it suits
those carrying out the genocide.
