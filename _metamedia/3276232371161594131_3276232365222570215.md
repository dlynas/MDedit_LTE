Our education as Jewish Americans has
been incomplete. The existence of
Palestine and the Palestinian people were
never named in my education or
upbringing. Not once. For others, their
existence was vehemently denied. And
this leaves me with a profound
understanding that no one will teach us
the history of Palestine but Palestinians.
Their historians, activists, organizers,
poets, and people demand our attention
now more than ever.
