Aside from the trauma from witnessing the
continuous genocide of their people and the
possibility of being killed, Cobalt and a lot of the
other materials being mined are highly toxic and
should not be handled unless given the proper
equipment and tools. This is obviously not the case
for those mining the materials and people are
being forced to touch Cobalt(which is extremely
toxic) with their bare hands while also inhaling its
fumes. Among these people are thousanda of
children. A
