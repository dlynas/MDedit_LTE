As events followed each other over the last weeks, | found it
impossible to express myself publicly without feeling like | was
caught in a reactive state to the deluge of online responses |
saw. | have felt my grief for the Israelis killed be repudiated by
many Israelis, who cannot find the space within them to
believe | can mourn these losses while still upholding an
unconditional solidarity for Gazans. Likewise, | have been
made to feel by many that mourning those same losses must
reveal a betrayal of my solidarity towards Palestinians.

| understand and support many Palestiniansâ€™ refusal to
condemn Hamas. Refusal to condemn does not equal support
and public condemnation does not happen in a vacuum. ltis a
positioning into a wider context, namely one in which the
Western world is currently committing collective punishment
by stopping aid and condoning genocide. One in which the
West has continuously failed to take any action against the
blockade, the occupation, the pogroms, the land theft, and
ethnic cleansing that is the ongoing Nakba. One in which the
World only ever pays attention when it is Israelis that are
being killed.

Refusing to condemn Hamas is a direct reaction to the West's
refusal to condemn Israel for the violence it has inflicted on
Palestinians for nearly a century. It is a necessary shift of
framing and not a condonement of the October 7th massacres
per se.
