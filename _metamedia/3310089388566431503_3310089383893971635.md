To be honest, I am afraid too â€”
with the kind of fear for my
children and the world we will
both live in. I am afraid that our
fight will be their fight. I am
afraid that the country is not
becoming better but worse. That
trust, in anything and anyone, is
eroding. That lies come easier
than the truth. That the injustice
around us will win because it has
so destabilized our ability to think
and exhausted our ability to fight
back.
