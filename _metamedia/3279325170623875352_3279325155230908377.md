This is why we target companies that supply the IOF
and directly benefit from the ongoing massacres.
Our intention is to shut down firms that sell
surveillance and suicide drones, ballistic missiles,
software and other on-hoard systems, essential
electronic components, and repressive tools -

all used to carry out the genocide. These devices
already exist in Europe : those are the same ones that

have been, year in and year out, watching our people
drown in the Mediterranean and preventing them
from crossing.
