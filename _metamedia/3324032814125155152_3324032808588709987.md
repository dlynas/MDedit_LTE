I'm a "positive" person by nature... | always find a way to
redirect my emotions in a productive way... but honestly
not this time. The sadness, darkness im feeling is
something i've never experienced before... how mamy
more bags of flour splattered with blood can we see??
How many more videos of children begging God to give
them back their arm/leg/foot can we watch?? How many
more videos of men being humiliated and abused can we
share?
