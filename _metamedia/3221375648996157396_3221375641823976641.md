If that weren’t enough, Palestinian slaughter is
too often presented ahistorically, untethered to
reality: It is not attributed to real steel and
missiles, to occupation, to policy. To earn
compassion for their dead, Palestinians must
first prove their innocence. The real problem
with condemnation is the quiet, sly tenor of the
questions that accompany it: Palestinians are
presumed violent — and deserving of violence
— until proved otherwise. Their deaths are
presumed defensible until proved otherwise.
What is the word of a Palestinian against a
machinery that investigates itself, that absolves
itself of accused crimes? What is it against a
government whose representatives have

r/.f‘(y-i-(lrj {;7"“. 2stinians uh

and “wild beas m?”’ When well-suit u\ man can
say brazenly and unflinchingly that there is no
such thing as a Palestinian people?

It is, of course, a remarkably effective strategy.
A slaughter isn’t a slaughter if those being
slaughtered are at fault, if they’ve been quietly
and effectively dehumanized — in the media,
through policy — for years. If nobody is a
civilian, nobody can be a victim.
