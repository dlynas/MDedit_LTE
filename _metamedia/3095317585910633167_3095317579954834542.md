Some facts about homelessness in
New York Clty: via Coalition for the Homeless

Research shows that the primary cause of homelessness,
particularly among families, is lack of affordable housing.
Surveys of homeless families have identified the following
major immediate, triggering causes of homelessness:
eviction; doubled-up or severely overcrowded housing;
domestic violence; job loss; hazardous housing conditions.

Each night thousands of unsheltered homeless people
sleep on New York City streets, in the subway system, and
in other public spaces. There is no accurate measurement
of New York City's unsheltered homeless population, and
recent City surveys significantly underestimate the number
of unsheltered homeless New Yorkers.

Studies show that the large majority of unsheltered
homeless New Yorkers are people living with mental illness
or other severe health problems.
