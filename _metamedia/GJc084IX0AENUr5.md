The premier said that after Khan Younis, “the main Hamas stronghold,”
the IDF is readying to fight next in Rafah.

Asked how the army can achieve an absolute victory if Israel is currently
withdrawing forces, Netanyahu replied that “this is a process that takes

where the IDF, he said, is engaged in ongoing raids to tackle the remaining
“splinters.”

“There is no alternative to the military collapse [of Hamas]. There will not
be a civilian collapse [of Hamas rule] without a military one,” he said.
