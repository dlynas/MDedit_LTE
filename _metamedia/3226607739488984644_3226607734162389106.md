Biden’s requested $14.3 billion

aid package is on top of the $3.8
billion that the U.S. already sends
tolsraeleveryyear.

EXZEE] just this year on your own. @

Israel is both the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. aid since

U.S. has given Israel a total of $270 billion between 1946 and
2023, adjusted for inflation.
