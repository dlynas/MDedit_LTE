Notice | didn’t mention TALENT?

| don’t believe in talent. Talent is for talent shows, like
America’s Got Talent.

I mean...talent is cool, but if you haven’t mastered
steps 1-2-3, you're just gonna be a talented Michael
Bublé singing covers with a perfect pitch
(booooooring.)

Some of us don’t have a talent. Or don’t have much
talent. Or whatever. SO WHAT. That shouldn’t deter
anybody from creative pursuits. Just follow the steps.
This isn’t an exclusive club for ppl who’ve been
“touched”. We can’t all be Stevie.

The creative fields are, and remain, open to all!

(And that, my friends, might be the most Rick Rubin
sentence of the night &.)
