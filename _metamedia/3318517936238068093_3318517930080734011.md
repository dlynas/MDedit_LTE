An Update on Gaza:
What You Should Know
March7,2024

81% of households in Gaza lack access
to safe and clean water.

Per OCHA, “According to UNICEF, 81% of households lack
access to safe and clean water, with internally displaced
people living in overcrowded collective centers or informal
sites being among the most affected.

An assessment conducted by WASH (water, hygiene and
sanitation) Cluster partners at 41 IDP sites in Rafah found
that people have access to only two liters of water per
person per day for drinking, cooking, washing and other
domestic purposes, mostly relying on water trucking. This is
significantly below the recommended minimum standard of
15 liters per person per day.”

Notably, Israel has, for months, blocked water purifiers
from entering Gaza on aid trucks, according to the
Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC).
