Imagine after MILLIONS of photos and videos
are shared by (often murdered) journalists

and others in Gaza, calling this rare and
exclusive.

The West is positively dripping in orientalist,
colonial sensibilities.

As tho only the western gaze makes these
horrific scenes real.

CNN journalists reporting from Gaza after "rare"
access and "exclusive" footage smells like the
doctrine of discovery
