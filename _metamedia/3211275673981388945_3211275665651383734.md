Hamas could disappear tomorrow, and Israel’s policy
of settler colonial expansion would continue. Consider
its policy in the West Bank, where the Palestinian
Authority headed by Mahmoud Abbas, Palestine’s
most compliant leader to date, operates under the
control of Israel’s occupying army Abbas has engaged
in security coordination with Israel to protect illegal
settlers as they steal Palestinian land and has been
complicit in Israel's siege suffocating Palestinians in
Gaza. In return for his acquiescence, Israel has
relentlessly expanded its settlement enterprise,
declared an intention to annex the Jordan Valley, and
shifted oversight of the West Bank from military to
civilian governance indicating the permanence of its

occupation.

Fixating on Palestinians as imperfect victims is the
absolution of, and complicity with, Israel’s colonial
domination.
