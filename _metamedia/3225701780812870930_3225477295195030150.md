"Why would Hamas attack Israel knowing
the consequences of their actions?"‚Äù

The PLO accepted all US and Israeli conditions for
peace and signed the Oslo Peace Accord in 1993, in
return for an end to Israeli occupation. 30 years have
passed, and the Palestinians regained nothing. On the
contrary, Israel occupied more land, built more
settlements, increased its military presence, and
violated holy sites.

Also, the Palestinians in Gaza launched a peaceful
initiative called the March of Return by walking to the
Israeli military fence surrounding Gaza demanding an
end to the suffocating blockade. Israeli snipers
responded by killing hundreds of marchers and
injuring over 36,000; the marchers posed no eminent
threat to the Israeli forces.

For the Palestinians, peace treaties and peaceful
marches only exacerbated their loss and perpetuated
their suffering. It is no surprise that they will resort to
all available means, including armed struggle.
