On parts of the [global] left, there is a belief that it is possible to
bring about meaningful, lasting change in Israel-Palestine
without engaging with Israeli Jews. The Israeli left, which still
exists despite the body blows it has taken over the past two
decades, should be one of the most important allies in the
struggle for Palestinian equality and freedom. Unfortunately, it
has been overlooked, or worse, blacklisted by the global left for
its failure to support a Palestinian right of return. The very
community we should be strengthening is instead being starved
by its purported fellow travelers.

Green has noted what many others, including American
officials, have observed: Bibiâ€™s administration is seeking regime
change in Gaza with no plan for what comes next. This is folly.
Everyone knows it. The U.S. has learned and relearned this
lesson many times over.
