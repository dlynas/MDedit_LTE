An Update on Gaza:
What You Should Know
February 1.2024

30 Palestinians held by Israel were found
executed inside of a Gaza school.

According to a report from the non-governmental agency
Palestinian Prisoner Society, “Thirty handcuffed and
blindfolded bodies were found inside a school in Beit Lahia
in northern Gaza” after the Israeli military’s withdrawal. The
group said that the Palestinians were being held by Israeli
forces prior to being found.

“It’s clear that the occupation forces had carried out a
field execution against these people,” the NGO added.
The group also said that Israeli authorities refuse to provide
information about the fate of Palestinians held by Israeli
forces in the Gaza Strip.

News of the suspected executions follows months of human
rights organizations as well as the UN accusing Israel of
torturing those who they arbitrarily detain in Gaza. Further,
EuroMed Human Rights Monitor reports that Israeli forces
have been conducting “mass killing, destruction, and
comprehensive abuse” against civilians in Khan Younis.
