We hold that Zionism is moral and just. And since it is moral and just, justice
must be done, no matter whether Joseph or Simon or Ivan or Achmet agree with it or

not.
There is no other morality.
Eventual Agreement

In the second place, this does not mean that there cannot be any agreement
with the Palestine Arabs. What is impossible is a voluntary agreement. As long as the
Arabs feel that there is the least hope of getting rid of us, they will refuse to give up
this hope in return for either kind words or for bread and butter, because they are not a
rabble, but a living people. And when a living people yields in matters of such a vital
character it is only when there is no longer any hope of getting rid of us, because they
can make no breach in the iron wall. Not till then will they drop their extremist
leaders whose watchword is "Never!" And the leadership will pass to the moderate
groups, who will approach us with a proposal that we should both agree to mutual
concessions. Then we may expect them to discuss honestly practical questions, such
as a guarantee against Arab displacement, or equal rights for Arab citizen, or Arab

national integrity.

And when that happens, I am convinced that we Jews will be found ready to
give them satisfactory guarantees, so that both peoples can live together in peace, like

good neighbours.

But the only way to obtain such an agreement, is the iron wall, which is to say a
strong power in Palestine that is not amenable to any Arab pressure. In other words,
the only way to reach an agreement in the future is to abandon all idea of seeking an

agreement at present.
