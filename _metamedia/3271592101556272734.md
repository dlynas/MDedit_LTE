Israel bombing Lebanon to kill Hamas Deputy
Saleh Al-Arouri tells us at least 3 things:

1) They have enough precision and intelligence
to target a specific person in another country,
so all the killings of Palestinians civilians are
certainly intentional.

2) They wouldn’t dare attack the real Hamas
leaders located in Qatar and Egypt because
Israel knows these 2 countries would not fight
back, unlike Lebanon.

3) Israel wants to make this a regional war in
order to pull American troops into it.

Genocide Joe can’t control Israel, and
Americans are paying for it.
