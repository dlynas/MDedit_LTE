Dec 29,2023 - &

Two months of literally around the clock work
ended yesterday when this devastating story
was published. You know Anat Schwartz as a
filmmaker but a few days after October 7 her
life took a turn and she started drilling down
into the some of the most horrific angles of the
Hamas attack. | was skeptical initially, but for
Anat my skepticism only makes the challenge
more interesting. Anat and her fellow reporters,
the Pulitzer Prize winner Jeffrey Gettleman and
my amazing nephew Adam Sella, interviewed
over 150 people for this investigation and the
things they saw and heard are unbearable. The
story is not for everyone. Parts of it will haunt
you at night. But it's extremely important that
the truth will be out.
