RHEINMETALL, GERMANY

The company’s share price rose from EUR 233.8
before the war to EUR 280.6 now, generating a
20% profit for investors, and a value of USD 2.34
billion. The company is considered one of the
top manufacturers of the tank shells that Israel is
using in its war now. Rheinmetall increased the
pace of its production after the launch of the war
to meet the Israeli army’s demand for the shells.
