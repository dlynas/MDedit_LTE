(%,; @99 @zei squirrel - 20h

Zionist organizations are now paying
college students from pro-Israel groups to
hold events where they will "reenact
Hamas mass rape" as part of their
depraved genocidal atrocity propaganda
campaign. Thisis insane. They're acting
out a rape hoax for money to launder a
genocide

As their message reads, 'Cornellians
for Israel' claim to be organizing this
event in honor of Internationa
Women's Day, and are paying
individuals $20/hr to dress up as
Hamas members and pretend to rape
Israeli women.
