No one is free until
we are all free.

Understand that. Repeat that to yourself over
and over again. Think deeply about what that
means. True joy comes from being in
community, from facing the struggle, from
dedicating yourself to this joint struggle for
liberation, from giving away what you
absolutely donâ€™t need, from risking the
privilege that you cannot give away. This is
not about glorifying the struggle but
reminding ourselves that looking away from
the pain & suffering of the most marginalized
will never ever give us the validation, meaning
& purpose we all so desperately seek. We can
only do this together & every second we
ignore that truth is a second wasted.
