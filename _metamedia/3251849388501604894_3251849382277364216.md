No "Misunderstanding'

This Arab editor was actually willing to agree that Palestine has a very large
potential absorptive capacity, meaning that there is room for a great many Jews in the
country without displacing a single Arab. There is only one thing the Zionists want,
and it is that one thing that the Arabs do not want, for that is the way by which the
Jews would gradually become the majority, and then a Jewish Government would
follow automatically, and the future of the Arab minority would depend on the
goodwill of the Jews; and a minority status is not a good thing, as the Jews themselves
are never tired of pointing out. So there is no "misunderstanding".

The Zionists want only one thing, Jewish immigration; and this Jewish immigration is

what the Arabs do not want.

This statement of the position by the Arab editor is so logical, so obvious, so
indisputable, that everyone ought to know it by heart, and it should be made the basis
of all our future discussions on the Arab question. It does not matter at all which
phraseology we employ in explaining our colonising aims, Herzl's or Sir Herbert

Samuel's.

Colonisation carries its own explanation, the only possible explanation,

unalterable and as clear as daylight to every ordinary Jew and every ordinary Arab.

Colonisation can have only one aim, and Palestine Arabs cannot accept this aim. It
lies in the very nature of things, and in this particular regard nature cannot be

changed.

The Iron Wall

We cannot offer any adequate compensation to the Palestinian Arabs in return
for Palestine. And therefore, there is no likelihood of any voluntary agreement being
reached. So that all those who regard such an agreement as a condition sine qua non

for Zionism may as well say "non" and withdraw from Zionism.
