“White supremacy and capitalism have
stolen not only our rest, but also our
intuition. To think that in this day and
age, there’s no time for you to at least
take 10 minutes to reclaim rest and
daydream and shut your eyes... That’s
all false and has been told to us by
systems that don’t see us as divine.”

—Tricia Hersey
