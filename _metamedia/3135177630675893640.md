BILLIONAIRES DON'T
EARN THEIR WEALTH

There are two ways to become a billionaire:

1. Inherit it. (44% of all billionaires)
2. Cold-blooded, merciless exploitation of the
working class

If you make $156k a year (triple the US median
income), it would take you 6,410 years to earn a
billion dollars. If you make the federal minimum
wage it'd take you almost 70,000 years.

A billionaire is not working 70,000 times harder
than a janitor. Labor creates wealth.
