ECONOMIC JUSTICE

The devastating, violent killing of #JordanNeely
reflects so much about what is broken in our city:

Jordan's death is an indictment of the mayor's failed
approach to public safety; The mayor's budget
spends billions on policing but refuses to adequately
invest in housing and healthcare.

Jordan Neely was a human being.
He was our neighbor. His life mattered. He
needed care, and Mayor Adams' New York failed
to provide it. May Jordan's memory be a blessing.
