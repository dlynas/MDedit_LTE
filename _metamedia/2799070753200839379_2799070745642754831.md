WOKESCIENIFIST AYESHA KHAN

Trauma is a shared,
collective, universal
experience

You may think- “I had a relatively comfortable life
and a supportive family. Others have it much
worse!” You may not think you’ve faced “real”
trauma, but- you have. All of us have. Even if you
feel defensive or confused, hang with me here.

Depending on your family and community history,
your access to resources shaped by your social
identities and the amount of privilege you have under
existing systems- you face varying levels of trauma in
the present and past. Your community experienced
trauma that is passed down and compounded with
each generation- it defines our relationships.
