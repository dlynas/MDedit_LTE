  - - Matthew Sitman on X I wrote this essay about depression
    - but it's really about how close many of us are to ending up in a situation similar to Jordan Neely
    - and how people's responses to it probably have something to do with whether or not t.md

Scialabba never directly addresses the question, but one wonders how much his politics
relate to his experience of depression. He is a man of the Left, an advocate of democratic
socialism. Contrary to the assertions of many on the Right, such commitments aren’t
dependent on a naive belief in progress or human perfectibility, an optimism about
“human nature”—at least not in Scialabba’s view, and not in mine cither. Instead, such a
politics can be based in human frailty, the understanding that we're less free than we want
to admit, and that the illusions of “meritocracy” mostly just flatter those who have been
more fortunate, or had the resources to evade consequences for their misdeeds and
mistakes. This politics is democratic in the deepest sense: what we share most of all is our
vulnerability to cruelty and chance, unexpected ruin or sudden defeat. It recognizes the
unchosen limits and circumstances that mark our lives, which no amount of
bootstrapping can overcome.

There are those who want to build a world where lives bend but do not break when
sickness or strife hits, and then there are those who are serenely confident that their
prosperity and position are the outcome of their striving, and that they are beyond the
reach of such afflictions. Perhaps what puts someone on one side of that divide or the
other is how much they can truly imagine losing. By sharing his struggles, Scialabba has
provided not just a profound account of depression, but a reminder of how precarious our
lives can be, and how much we need each other.
