The conflict and the genocide of the
Congolese people is not new however the
uptick of violence against them has risen with
the increased demand for resources that aid
in the production of clean energy. While
Congo did gain independence after years of
being colonized, oppressed,enslaved, and
mass murdered by Belgium, they are
currently ongoing the horrors of being
trafficked, raped, murdered, and forced to
work for little to no money by extremists

militant groups.
