An Update on Gaza:
What You Should Know
February 1.2024

The horrifying reality in Gaza:

On average, 1 child is killed every 10 minutes.

There has been a 300 percent increase in miscarriages
among pregnant people.

The entire population is facing famine brought on by
Israel’s utilization of starvation of a weapon of war.

On average, more than 10 children per day have had to
have an limb amputated, many without anesthesia.

Nearly 70 percent of homes in Gaza are uninhabitable
due to Israeli attacks.

Disease is rapidly spreading among Gaza’s 1.7 million
internally displaced people.
