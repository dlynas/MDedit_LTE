Ohio’s Secretary of State purged almost
27,000 voters from rolls right before the
state’s reproductive rights vote.

“Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose purged almost
27,000 people from voter rolls prior to next week’s election,
which features ballot measures on reproductive rights and
legalizing cannabis, new reporting shows.

Inactive voter registrations are usually removed by Ohio’s
election officials the summer between primary and general
elections. However, LaRose’s office carried out the purging
of 27,000 voters this past September, less than two months
before a ballot measure to enshrine the reproductive rights
of Ohio citizens into law.

Democrats are now bringing up concerns that voters were
wrongfully purged and some may lose their right to vote for
simply moving from one county to another. LaRose ordered
three counties — Cuyahoga, Summit and Lucas, which
house the large cities of Cleveland, Akron and Toledo,
respectively — to not update their voter rolls until after the
election.

State Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Westlake) pointed out
that the voter purge occurred on Sept. 28, days after the
election technically began when absentee ballots were
issued on Sept. 22.”
