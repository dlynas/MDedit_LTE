The US intelligence director's Annual Threat
Assessment Report pulls the rug from under
Israel's claim to be "eliminating Hamas" (while
actually slaughtering Gaza's civilians en masse):

"Israel probably will face lingering armed
resistance from Hamas for years to come, and
the [Israeli] military will struggle to neutralize
Hamas's underground infrastructure, which
allows insurgents to hide, regain strength and
surprise Israeli forces."
