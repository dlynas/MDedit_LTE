Palestinians need our absolute and uncompromising
solidarity; | amplify their need and ask you for the same:
take to the streets, call your politicians, and hold them
accountable for the blanket support they always have and
still are giving to Israel’s violence. Your countries are
responsible for what is happening too. The murderous
attack on Gaza needs to stop right now, and Israel will only
agree to a ceasefire once it is pressured to do so.

The idea that a colonised people can be forced into
submission is not just abhorrent, it is also utterly
unrealistic. Ending the apartheid regime and ongoing
colonisation, giving reparations for the Nakba, and
supporting Palestinians’ right to return are the only chance
we have to start working towards a world that is actually
worth living in. One in which we can begin to heal, and one
in which all people can be free.
