We called a mass action about a week ago where a couple hundred people flooded up to the
office. And at one point, police started arresting people at random, throwing them on the
ground, accusing them of assaulting them and so forth. And then we saw actions one night
after the march in DC in Arlington, Virginia, in Birdsboro, Pennsylvania, and again in

Cambridge.

And this is what we're really asking, or what we're hoping for is that people take up these
tactics in regional chapters everywhere in the country where Elbit is, that we develop
focused targeting of other targets, especially west of the Mississippi where Elbit is not, but
focus targets. Because if we just hit Raytheon and Boeing and BlackRock and The New York
Times and every other day, we're not mounting a strategic campaign. Again, people are using
the language of “shut it down” a lot, which, in my experience, really started around the
Ferguson moment about 10 years ago, that let’s shut it down because people were shutting

down commerce to shed light on police violence.

In the movement since then, we hear “shut it down” every time someone holds a sign up.
And it’s valiant to go into places to harass senators, to list names. But in the end, we're still
not really challenging power in a direct way that, as Max illustrated, is affecting their
operations, affecting their bottom line, affecting their ability to process the war machine and

make money off of it.

So we're really hoping, without even giving our opinion on the strategic or political
developments that should or shouldn't happen with the US government, we're saying we
want to take very direct material action against the complex that enables this genocide and
the US empire broadly. So it's not just one action, and it's not just one type of action, but it’s
action that's meaningful, and it's action that is bringing into focus why we're doing the
action, and not the risks being taken by the people doing the actions, not the legal battles
they get into. That's not the story. We're comfortable. We should be less comfortable. And

that's the way we see this.
