Hamas has launched an unprecedented attack against
Israel, taking aim at the apartheid and colonial regime
that has subjugated Palestinians for 75 years. Western
reaction and media coverage of the attack have
emphasized the fallibility of Israel’s military apparatus
as well as Hamas’s tactics, which have not
distinguished between military and civilian targets.

Few Western observers have highlighted the context
of Israel's structural violence that has condemned
Palestinians to a slow death, thus missing a critical
opportunity to advance a true, durable solution in the

region.
