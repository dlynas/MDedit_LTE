We are currently millions to feel powerless witnessing from afar
the genocide currently unfolding on Palestinians of Gaza.

Fighting this powerlesshess means organizing for tomorrow to
support, at our own scale, the Palestinian struggle for liberation.

In order to do so, we need to be useful where we can.
For you, architecture students, this may mean understanding

the geography and architecture of Israeli settler colonialismin
Palestine to then be able to act upon this understanding.
