Mass graves in Canada /

Like Israel, other western colonial countries have a
history of concealing the state-sponsored murder
of Indigenous peoples within mass graves.

At the Canadian Indian residential
school, a network of boarding
schools created to assimilate
Indigenous children away from their
culture, an estimated 3,200 mass
graves were discovered across 27
burial sites.
