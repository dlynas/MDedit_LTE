Rep Zooey ZephyrQ
How itstarted how it's going

fy¥ ezoandBehold

I've said it 3 times now--we
need trans representation in the
Montana gov't.

I'm filled with a mix of fear/rage
about what Montana's doing to
me & my community, & a burning
drive to fight against it!

Next year, I'm gonna run for office
in the Montana legislature.
