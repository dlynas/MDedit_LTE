Would you willingly give the regime of
Israel $89 of your own money today?

The U.S. government is trying to force you to.

The United States government wants to give $14.3 billion in taxpayer
money to the Israeli military. Averaged across 160 million taxpayers,
that adds up to around $89 per U.S. taxpayer.
