Not to be petty, but FYI, Israelis don't wash their asses.
They use toilet paper.
And I feel like that's a pretty clear indication of who's the colonizer.
Because usually colonizer folks don't.
Indigenous people do.
Because we know cleanliness.
Like if you're in Palestine, you can tell whether a business is run by an Israeli or a Palestinian
based on whether the bathroom has a...
a shataf, a water spray, or at least like a bucket, a brick, to wash yourself.
If it's Israeli, they don't have toilet paper.
No shataf, no tabo, for Filipino, lo tath, or daisy, just toilet paper.
Everyone else in the Middle East washes, except for them.
That says something.
I feel like that speaks to Indigenous.
So I'm gonna think about it.
