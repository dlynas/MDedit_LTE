By this logic non-Jews and non-Germans should
not have “joined the conversation” about the
Holocaust. Humanity means caring about
another’s annihilation as your own.
Understanding that our liberation from
oppressive systems is connected.

Privilege is not being Jewish, Israeli, or
Palestinian, and deciding you have a right to join
the conversation.
