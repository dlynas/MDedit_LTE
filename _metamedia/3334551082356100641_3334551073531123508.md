Gritty is the Way @Gritty20202 -1d
Electing more Democrats won't protect
women's reproductive freedom as long as
politicians can continue fundraising off the
threat of losing it.

History of Democrats Refusing To Codify
Roe v Wade when they could have:

Jimmy Carter: Supermajority 1977-1979, Majority
79-81

Bill Clinton: Full Majority 1993 -1995

Barack Obama: Supermajority for 72 days, Majority
from 2009 - 2011.

(plus independents who agreed to vote for the Freedom of Choice Act
Obama promised to codify "first thing" after \\lllllilt,\{lllr‘ election
But, Obama quickly said after winning, it's not his "highest
legislative priority.”

Joe Biden: Full Majority 2021 - 2023

When Democrats say "we didn't have enough votes" and
then fundraise for anti-abortion dems over pro-choice
dems, they are telling you they don't support choice.
