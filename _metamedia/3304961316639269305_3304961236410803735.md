On the difficulty of knowing
what's going outside your specific
algorithm

These digital platforms and feeds, they
kind of promise a great communal
experience, like we're connecting with all
the other TikTok users or all of the other
Instagram users, but | think they're
actually kind of atomizing our
experiences, because we can never tell
what other people are seeing in their own
feeds. We don't have a sense of how many
other people are fans of the same thing
that we are fans of or even if they're
seeing the same piece of culture that
we're seeing, or experiencing an album or
a TV show, in the same way. So | think
there's this lack of connection.
