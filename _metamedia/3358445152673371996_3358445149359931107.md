“If people are serious about moving
ahead to create a better society, then of
course, they should not allow themselves
to be deterred simply because of a few
people at the top, who usually possess a
monopoly on violence, decide that they
are going to unleash all of their forces
of oppression to stop them.”

—Angela Davis
