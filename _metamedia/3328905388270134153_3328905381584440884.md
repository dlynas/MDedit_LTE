If you asked my friends in graduate school or college or
high school if they could see me as someone who would
one day not care about a career or being exceptional in
some way, they’d chuckle. | used to care a lot about being
“successful” in academic medicine. | thought | had to be
exceptional & “prove” my worth to this society. The
reasons were heavily fear-based. | came from poverty so
it's understandable to some extent. Most of us need to
participate in capitalist/ colonial systems in some way to
feed ourselves (for now). But before, | never questioned
how far into the empire | REALLY need to bury myself.
How far into this rabbit hole do | really gotta go?
