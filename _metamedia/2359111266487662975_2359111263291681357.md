BILLIONRIRES RRE A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY

Excerpted from “The Hidden Billionaires” by Meagan Day for Jacobin

“Billionaires are some of the most important political figures in
the country, but they are unelected, which means the public has
no direct way of holding them accountable. [They] devote
massive amounts of money to cutting government programs
and slashing taxes on corporations and the rich, against the
wishes of the majority of Americans.”

But when speaking publicly, they “almost always say things that

Americans broadly agree with or that will improve their image.”

“One of their primary defenses against public outrage is the
prevailing impression that many of them are good-hearted,
charitable, and have the interests of the general public in mind.
Indeed, this pattern of outspokenness only when their views line
up with the majority’s promotes a right-wing worldview in
which billionaires are seen as society’s paternalistic benefactors.

“That couldn’t be further from the truth: billionaires are self-
interested, and they go to great lengths to promote their own
well-being over the well-being of everyone else.”
