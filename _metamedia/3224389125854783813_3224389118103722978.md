| am writing this while we are witnessing a significant and
terrifying increase of antisemitic attacks. Last week, Molotov
cocktails were thrown at a synagogue in Berlin, houses of
Jewish people have been marked with stars of David, and
Jewish people all over the world are being verbally and
physically attacked. While almost all of the antisemitic violence
happening in Germany is statistically proven to be committed
by white Germans, there is no point in denying that antisemitic
sentiment is not limited to white people alone. Doing so would
mean to deny the many displacements Jewish people have
lived through in North Africa and West Asia, and to ignore the
intersectional experience of discrimination by Black and brown
Jews all over the world.

Nevertheless, | find myself once again insisting on three
things: Firstly, that we cannot prioritise the looming danger of
antisemitism over the existential threat Palestinians are facing
at this moment. Secondly, that the instrumentalization of
antisemitism to silence all Palestinian resistance is extremely
harmful and gravely obstructing the fight against antisemitism
in the first place. And lastly and most importantly, that it is time
to acknowledge that adopting the tools of our oppressors and
trying to save Jewish people with violent ethno-nationalism, will
never lead to safety or our own liberation.
