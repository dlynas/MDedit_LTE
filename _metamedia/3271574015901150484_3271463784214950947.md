66 “YET IT IS...PRECISELY IN THE
RESPONSE OF THE OPPRESSED TO THE
VIOLENCE OF THEIR OPPRESSORS THAT

A GESTURE OF LOVE MAY BE FOUND.
CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY, THE
ACT OF REBELLION BY THE
OPPRESSED...CAN INITIATE LOVE.
WHEREAS THE VIOLENCE OF THE
OPPRESSORS PREVENTS THE OPPRESSED
FROM BEING FULLY HUMAN, THE
RESPONSE OF THE LATTER TO THIS
e VIOLENCE IS GROUNDED IN THE
W DESIRE TO PURSUE THE RIGHT
A TO BE HUMAN.” ~ P. 56 99
