Helpful Context for Frustrating Conversations About Gaza //

“If Hamas did not strike on October 7,
then Palestinians would not have been
relentlessly killed by Israel.”

Many blame Hamas for Israel's disproportionate response and
the lethal crackdown on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip,
arguing that Hamas is putting Palestinian lives in danger by
fighting against Israeli apartheid. However, this line of
argument is an evasion tactic. It unfairly shifts the blame
onto the victims, holding them accountable for resisting their
occupier, while absolving the oppressor of any responsibility. It
is also a dangerous and misleading argument, as it dismisses
the killing of Palestinians as a standard response or “collateral
damage”.

Furthermore, this argument neglects crucial context. The
grim reality is that Israel's blockade has long been gradually
causing the demise of the entire population in Gaza. Gaza’s
humanitarian crisis was considered a ticking time bomb back
in 2012 when the United Nations warning that Gaza would
become uninhabitable by 2020 due to the blockade.

It is therefore important to acknowledge that no Palestinian
would willingly choose or accept enduring such
conditions indefinitely, even though they are aware that
change comes at a steep price.
