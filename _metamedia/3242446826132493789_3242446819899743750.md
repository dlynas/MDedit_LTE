Helpful Context for Frustrating Conversations About Gaza //

“Israel has no control in Gaza.”

Israel has been imposing a land, sea, and air blockade in
Gaza since 2005. That blockade was tightened in 2007 in
response to the election of Hamas. Israel has control over
the movement of water, fuel, and other critical
supplies. Israel also controls the physical movement of
the more than 2,300,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Gaza is
surrounded by concrete walls and 20-foot barbed wire
fences constructed by Israel. Residents of Gaza cannot
leave or enter without approval from Israel.

Additionally, since June 1967, the Israeli military authorities
consolidated complete power over all water resources
and water-related infrastructure. Israel also made “precise
calculations of Gaza's daily calorie needs to avoid
malnutrition” during their blockade in Gaza between 2007
and mid-2010, per defense ministry files.

Does all of that sound like ‘no control’ to you?

Finally, the consensus among prominent international
institutions, organizations, bodies, and international legal
experts is that Israel has occupied Palestinian territories—-
including Gaza—-since 1967.
