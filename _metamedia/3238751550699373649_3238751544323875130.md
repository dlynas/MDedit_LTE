As | said earlier this week, “decolonization”, “from the river to the sea”
and similar euphemisms necessarily imply genocide.

Clear calls for extreme violence are against our terms of service and will
result in suspension.

Replying to @SwipeWright

Yes, “decolonization” necessarily implies a Jewish genocide, thus it is
unacceptable to any reasonable person
