And anyone listening who has an Elbit factory or another genocide profiteer in their
neighborhood, we encourage you to take action right now to get organized and shut it
down. And the more and more people that are doing this, the less politically feasible it is for
them to charge us and for them to crack down on us. Because the reality is the vast, vast
majority of humanity stands with Palestine and stands on the right side of history.

Fergie Chambers: Yeah, that's the main point of focus as we orient ourselves to a legal

strategy or something like that. There have been many direct action movements which have
been very effective that were done almost entirely in the shadows. There have been smaller
instances of crews doing things like that. But I think we believe that this is one of these
cases where the visibility of the moment internationally and nationally together with the
visibility of even the specific campaign that we've launched in this country, because of what

they did already in the UK, because of some of the networks that we had just from

organizing here in the US, that the combination of these factors with the concrete facts of

what is happening in Gaza are enough to push the envelope on what we can do publicly

without losing public support.

In a lot of instances that may be appropriate for direct action, unfortunately, the sort of
propagandized American public will pay no mind to certain types of direct action or think
that itâ€™s kind of distasteful and not want to get near that. We're not seeing that here. We are
seeing people of some conscience who are understanding the very basic premise that human
life is more valuable than property. And this is a discussion of course, that's been going on
all throughout the last decade in talking about Ferguson and Standing Rock and George
Floyd, and I think people are really beginning to absorb that.
