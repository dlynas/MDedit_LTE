Unlike its original reporting, the new article also
does not mention the word "rape." It goes into a
great deal of detail about what seems to be a
genuinely harrowing ordeal for Ms. Soussana,
but when it comes to describing the alleged act
of sexual assault, the Times demurs:

Ms. Soussanaâ€™s personal account of her experience in captivity is
consistent with what she told two doctors and a social worker less
than 24 hours after she was freed on Nov. 30. Their reports about

her account state the nature of the sexual act; The Times agreed
not to disclose the specifics.
