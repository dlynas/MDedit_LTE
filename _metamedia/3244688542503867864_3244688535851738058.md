Arab-American voters: We’re upset that Biden
is k*lling our relatives

White Biden Bros: Your lives don’t matter and

we don’t need your votes @2 @7 2

Cool. Good luck and fuck off then. We are not
playing this game. You are never going to get the
Democratic Party to abandon Israel to Hamas,

Since I've been back home for Thanksgiving break,
I've had in depth conversations with four Arab
relatives and family friends. All four have said they
won't vote for Biden in 2024. They insist they will
abstain, even if it ends up benefitting Trump.
