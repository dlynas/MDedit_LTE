Mass murder /

2 mass graves have been found in Khan Younis
since Israel withdrew their forces. Susan
Abdulhawa reports for the Middle East Eye,
presenting the unimaginable scene of desecrated
land and signs of torture.

Israel’s extermination site at Khan Younis is found
weeks after discovering the same system at Al
Shifa Hospital in Gaza’s North. Spreading hyper-
paranoia about an ambiguous Hamas presence in
Gaza, Israel has justified a heinous, gut-wrenching
Holocaust against Palestinians.
