[CITHESETIMES

The White House requested an “unprecedented”
loophole that would obscure arms sales to Israel.

“Buried within the $106 billion supplemental national
security funding request the White House sent to Congress
on October 20 was a highly unusual exemption.

As part of $3.5 billion earmarked for Foreign Military
Financing (FMF) funding for Israel, the executive branch
sought permission to unilaterally blanket-approve the future
sale of military equipment and weapons—Ilike ballistic
missiles and artillery ammunition —to Israel without
notifying Congress.

This means the Israeli government would be able to
purchase up to $3.5 billion in military articles and services in
complete secrecy. The House included the waiver
language in a bill that splits off Israeli military aid from the
rest of the package.

FMF requests like this one are essentially grants to
purchase weapons and defense services from the U.S. and
its defense contractors. Even after Congress approves an
FMF request, it still has power over how the money is spent
and can deny major arms sales.

The Congressional approval process also serves another
purpose: it creates a public record to ensure transparency.”
