In Gaza, | studied at two universities and worked
at a third. Professors who taught me have been
killed, colleagues have been murdered, and the
campuses where | studied and worked lay
mostly in ruins. The entire academic system has
been obliterated by Israel's bombs. Yet, here,
people have the audacity to claim they are not
safe because they witness student protests
against their institutions' complicity in human
rights violations or to simply express demands
for an end to genocide. Disgusting.
