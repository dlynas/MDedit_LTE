Aaron Bushnell

The sky over Gaza weeps ash—
So a man set himself on fire in front of the Isracli embassy.
But people are tired of posting about it on social media.

IDF drones have made Palestinian bodies unidentifiable—
So a man set himself on fire in front of the Isracli embassy.

But people feel it’s taking up too much space in conversations.

Gaza has been hit with three times the hell of Hiroshima—
So a man set himself on fire in front of the Israeli embassy.

But people already sold what little humanity they had to begin with.
