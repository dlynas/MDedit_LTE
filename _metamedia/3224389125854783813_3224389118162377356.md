As a Jewish person living in Germany, | am enraged at
seeing schools forbidding national symbols, at the police
brutalising people for wearing keffiyehs, Palestinian flags,
or for simply being Arab. It is not the first time that
Germans are effectively calling to ban an entire ethnicity
from speaking and existing in public, and | loathe that they
dare to pretend to be doing any of this for my and other
Jewish peopleâ€™s protection. They are doing this, once
again, in service of their own white-supremacist ideology. If
you are German and care about anti-fascism in any way,
call your politicians, carry a Palestinian flag, and take to
the streets. German fascism is on the rise.
