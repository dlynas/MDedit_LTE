Several members of the Palestinian-
American community refused to meet with
Secretary of State Antony Blinken in
Washington, D.C., on Thursday to discuss
the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

“After nearly four unbearable months of
constant US-enabled Israeli violence against
our families, friends and other innocent
civilians in Gaza, and throughout Palestine,
we cannot imagine what Secretary Blinken
could have to say or discuss with us,” read a
published statement by a group of
Palestinian leaders who were invited to the

meeting.
