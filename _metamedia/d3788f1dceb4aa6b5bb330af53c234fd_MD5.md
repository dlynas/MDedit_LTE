US Inflation Rate Falls Less
Than Expected

The annual inflation rate in the US slowed to 8.2% in September, the
lowest in seven months, compared to 8.3% in August but above
market expectations of 8.1%. The core rate which excludes volatile
food and energy, hit 6.6%, a new 40-year high in a sign inflationary
pressures remain elevated.
