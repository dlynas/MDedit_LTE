Here are the addresses of every factory manufacturing bombs and ammunition for Israel.
There are way more locations for these weapons manufacturers like corporate offices and R&D sites,
but the sites we listed are the locations that actually physically build and assemble the
munitions used by Israel. All of these locations have been carefully mapped out by Christian
Sorenson in Air Force Veteran and researcher with the Eisenhower Media Network, so if you can't
find a location close to you, you can go to his website and find a corporate office by your location.
Ammo is one of the biggest vulnerabilities in Israel's genocide. The bulk of the ammunition they
use is manufactured in the United States, not Israel. Without this stable supply line, Israel's
genocide would be untenable. A recent report revealed that the US has been secretly sending hundreds
of weapons shipments to Israel in the last five months, indicating that without this constant flow
of ammunition, their operations would become unsustainable. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
admitted his much in a private government meeting in December, saying, we need three things from the US.
Munitions, munitions, and munitions. He goes on, there are huge demonstrations in Western
capitals, Adam Netanyahu, whose concern political pressure overseas might threaten the US
arms shipments. We need to apply counter-pressure. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky more or less
said the same thing about US weapons shipments being crucial to his war against Russia.
In 1977, the UN Security Council unanimously passed an arms margot against apartheid South Africa
on the basis that those weapons would be used to commit crimes against humanity. Today, the
United States ascending weapons to Israel with the knowledge that these weapons will be used to
commit genocide. The United States is a signatory to the arms trade treaty, which explicitly prohibits
this, but the United States continues to arm Israel anyway. You could argue that the people who have
been protesting weapons manufacturers around the country are actually upholding the US's obligation
to this treaty where their government has failed. And on a final note, because we know this is going
to come up, the people who are protesting weapons factories aren't against people having jobs
or feeding their families. They're against the system which forces people to make weapons in order
to feed their families. The people working in these factories, the engineers, the metal workers,
the rocket scientists, are incredibly talented people. They have skills that would be incredibly
beneficial to the society if they were used to build things like public transportation, hospitals,
schools, or energy crits. In fact, we don't even need to put a whole lot of thought into what
alternatives these factories could be used for, because Christian Sorenson has already listed out how
each of these factories can be used in a peace economy. One thing a lot of people don't know is that
these weapons companies intentionally spread their offices and factories in every state around the
country, so politicians and voters feel like without the arms industry, we lose jobs. But these
factories can easily be re-tooled to produce things that actually benefit humanity instead of
destroy it. In the fact that some of our greatest scientists and most talented engineers are being
used to build weapons for glorified weapons traffickers should be considered a massive indictment
of the system and its priorities. On October 24th, investors called discussing the prospect of the
US sending more weapons to Israel, the CEO of RTX, formerly Raytheon, said, quote,
I think really across the entire Raytheon portfolio, you're going to see a benefit of this restocking.
This genocide is of course a land grab, its colonialism, but it's also a big business,
and the ones pushing our government to keep this genocide going are these merchants of death
who cheer at the advent of war in genocide. As long as there are industries that profit off of war,
there's always going to be an incentive to go to war for profit. The US arms trafficking industry
spends hundreds of billions of dollars every year lobbying our politicians to maintain a foreign
policy of endless war, and they profit off of every bullet in tank that gets sent. In a lot of
ways they operate like a shadow government, pulling the strings on US politics from behind the scenes.
So the next time some politician tells you that we need to destroy this or that country for our
national security, just remember who's paying them to say that.
