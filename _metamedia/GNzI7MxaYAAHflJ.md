Orion’s capabilities are startling. A
police force could have drones
automatically launch from charging
stations when triggered by “events like
gunshots, burglaries, and car accidents.”
Once they deploy, the drones can
perform pre-set tasks: releasing cargo;
relaying live video feeds; identifying and
searching for people, objects, or vehicles
using Al and thermal sensors; and
making announcements over
loudspeaker. If the system gets multiple
calls, Orion can automatically choose
which to prioritize.
