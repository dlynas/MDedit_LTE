N | want to be as clear as | possibly can:

-

Nonviolent students calling for their
universities and government to stop giving
Israel money and weapons while it kills
thousands of innocent people in Gaza

is not the same

as when Nazis attempted to exterminate the
Jewish people.

As a Jew, | am scared.
Not for me. For my brothers and sisters.
For the first time in my life, | feel a level of fear | never thought I'd feel.
Itâ€™s a fear my grandmother described to me. She felt it.

| feel it.

This is headed in a very dark direction.
