The reason we shouldn’t describe what’s happening
in Palestine as a “conflict” isn't about semantics.

“Conflict” and “Colonialism”
(and forms of oppression in general)
are two different analytical frameworks
that identify different problems
and thus different solutions.

Western insistence on approaching Palestine
using the conflict framework is partly
why it fails to do anything other than

enable the oppression of Palestinians.

Let’s explain, once and for all, why this isn’t
a “conflict”. This time, by analyzing the real
political consequences of misapplying the
“conflict” framework to history’s most well-
documented case of settler colonialism.
