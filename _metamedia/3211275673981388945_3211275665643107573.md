This is to say nothing of the death and destruction
wrought by repeated, massive Israeli military assaults.
Since 2008, Israel has launched four large-scale
military offensives against a predominantly refugee
population trapped in one of the most densely
populated places on earth while denying a
humanitarian corridor for people to escape. During
these attacks, Israel has Kkilled entire families -
spanning several generations - with missile strikes at
their homes. Israel has also repeatedly bombed UN
hospitals and schools sheltering civilians, bearing the
UN'â€™s unmistakable blue emblem. Despite the litany of
well-documented war crimes, no one has been held to
account and the siege has only tightened.
