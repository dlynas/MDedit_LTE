This is a
boundary

I will finish this conversation
when you aren’t raising your
voice.

I can’'t answer your calls
during work hours because I
lose focus.

I am not ready to talk about
this yet - it is too personal

I am not looking for advice. I
have this figured out. thanks

I need some time to myself
to cool off. Let’s talk
tomorrow?
