To truly experience the good things, | had
to think less of myself & more about the
collective and devote myself to the
struggle. Connection made it harder &
harder for me to be fixate on myself AND
it saved me. It gave my life real purpose.
Today, | can’t fathom building a life for
myself that is severed from the greater
collective. | don't care about success or
opulence but of course, | still struggle to
let go of other things.

It's a constant process that is uncomfortable
AND freeing. Everyday is about figuring out
how | can dedicate more of myself to
community rather than to these oppressive
systems (i.e. via a job, career building,
excessive consumption/ materialism etc).

| think individual wellness and health are
overrated. “Wellness” as it is defined in the
mainstream is about severing yourself from
the struggle & prioritizing your own health
separate from community to meet colonial
standards of “healthy”. To be well under
capitalism is to be “thriving” in fundamentally
oppressive, inequitable systems.
