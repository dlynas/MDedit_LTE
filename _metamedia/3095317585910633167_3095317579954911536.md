"Jordan was a foster care youth like myself. He was
such a good individual who only became homeless
due to NYC's Administration for Children's Services.
What's insane is that he was literally just dancing on
trains and doing amazing, good things trying to
impersonate Michael Jackson. He didn't deserve
this and the fact that this white man is let loose on
the streets is crazy."
