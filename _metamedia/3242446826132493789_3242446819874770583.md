Helpful Context for Frustrating Conversations About Gaza //

“If Hamas just released the hostages,
all of this would end.”

On November 21, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
stated clearly that even after the hostages are released,
Israel will continue the Gaza Genocide: “We are at war,
and we will continue the war,” he said. “We will continue
until we achieve all our goals.”

Netanyahu and other Israeli government leaders have
made it abundantly clear—in words and actions—that the
genocidal action that they are inflicting in Gaza is, and
never has been, about the hostages:

* |srael’'s constant bombardment of the Gaza Strip has
resulted in the killing of at least 60 Israeli hostages.
Israel refused to negotiate on the release of hostages
on multiple occasions.

The ethnic cleansing of Gazans, first from the North
and now the South, is in line with the November 12th
statement made by Israeli security cabinet member
and Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter: “We are now
rolling out the Gaza Nakba ... Gaza Nakba 2023.
That’'s how it'll end.”
