“The self-burning of Viethamese
Buddhist monks in 1963 is somehow
difficult for the Western Christian
conscience to understand. The Press
spoke then of suicide, but in the
essence, it is not. It is not even a
protest. ...

To burn oneself by fire is to prove
that what one is saying is of the
utmost importance.”
