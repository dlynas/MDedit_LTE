7. As Middle East Eye reports, Israel is building a
ring of checkpoints around Rafah. Netanyahu
will suggest, falsely, that these guarantee its
attack meets the conditions laid down in
international humanitarian law. Women and
children will be allowed out - if they can reach a
checkpoint before Israel’s carpet bombing kills
them along the way.

8. All men in Rafah, and any women and
children who remain, will be treated as armed
combatants. If they are not killed by the
bombing or falling rubble, they will be either
summarily executed or dragged off to Israel’s
torture chambers. No one will mention that any
Hamas fighters who were in Rafah were able to
leave through the tunnels.
