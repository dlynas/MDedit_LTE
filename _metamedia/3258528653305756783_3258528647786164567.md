Kwame Ture: "The reason the liberal seeks to stop
confrontation — and this is the second pitfall of
liberalism is that his role of regardless of what he says
is really to maintain the status quo rather than to
change it."

"The liberal is afraid to alienate anyone, and..

therefore, he is incapable of presenting any clear
alternative."

From here, Kwame Ture "The Pitfalls of Liberalism"
