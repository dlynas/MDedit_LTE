So, can someone tell me what stage of grief I'm in?

Because maybe, just maybe, if | can "label" this emotion,
as we've been taught, I'll be able to accept it, to sit with it,
and within it until a miracle occurs. A miracle that revives
humanity in humans. A miracle that ensures that luck
(only) is not what determines our fate. A miracle that
allows humanity to rise above greed. A miracle that makes
humans become humane again.

Until then, can someone tell me what stage of grief I'm in?
