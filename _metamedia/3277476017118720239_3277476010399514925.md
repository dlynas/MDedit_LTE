Anthony Blinken even boasted about itin a
talk for AIPAC:

"My grandfather, Maurice Blinken initiated a
report before independence that argued that

Antony Blinken's father-in-law, Samuel Pisar,
was also a close confidant of Israeli super spy
Robert Maxwell, father of Ghislaine.

Itis believed Blinken's father-in-law, Pisar,
was one of the last people Maxwell spoke to
before his suspicious death in 1991.
