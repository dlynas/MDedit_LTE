Housing 4 All is Hot
@ahouse4all

There is also something to be said
about how the grind of non-profit
work kills the revolutionary/activist
spirit by draining your time + energy.
If you're doing eviction defense work
all day the chances you have the
energy to go to a tenants union
meeting and organize is low.
