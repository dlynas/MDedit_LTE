How they asked, “how is Donald
Trump racist?”” How they put his
word above the Bible. How they
silenced any criticism, turning it
on us and telling us that we were
the ones who were wrong and not
the people who hated us. How
they were willing to sacrifice us
and even themselves to hold onto
white power. How they could not
be trusted because, in the end,
they must win and we must lose.
