An Update on Gaza:
What You Should Know
February 1.2024

Israel has maintained its rate of
killing in Gaza post-ICJ ruling.

According to a report from EuroMed Human Rights
Monitor, the Israeli army has maintained its rate of killing
civilians in Gaza following a ruling from the International
Court of Justice that explicitly ruled that Israel must “take all
measures” to prevent genocide.

The rights group added that Israel has also ramped up its
efforts to starve [the people of Gaza] as well as forcibly
displace them from their homes in the Strip.
