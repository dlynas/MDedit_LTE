Nowhere in my education did | learn the
history of Zionism. The history of Palestine
during the Ottoman Empire. Mandatory
Palestine from '20-48. The massacres of
the Nakba. And there was no education
about the decades of oppression that
followed. The realities of occupation,
siege, state violence and settler terrorism.
We all learned the history of the
Holocaust. We are responsible for learning
these histories now.
