““VIOLENCE IS INITIATED BY THOSE
WHO OPPRESS, WHO EXPLOIT, WHO
FAIL TO RECOGNIZE OTHERS AS
PERSONS — NOT BY THOSE WHO ARE
OPPRESSED, EXPLOITED, AND
UNRECOGNIZED...IT IS NOT THE
HELPLESS, SUBJECT TO TERROR, WHO
INITIATE TERROR, BUT THE VIOLENT,
WHO WITH THEIR POWER CREATE THE
CONCRETE SITUATION WHICH BEGETS
‘THE REJECTS OF LIFE.” ”’

B. 55 ,,
