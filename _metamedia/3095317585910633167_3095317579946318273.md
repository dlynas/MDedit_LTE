Our unhoused neighbors in New York
City face more danger than they pose.

65 unhoused individuals have been victims of homicide in the
city since 2019; they are in a constant state of being policed
by the militarized NYPD; the shelter system fails people at
every turn. You think inflation has had an impact on you - a
person with an income and shelter? Imagine having neither of
those things and trying to survive every single day. Now
factor in a Mayor who initiates sweeps of the only shelter that
you have - everything you own, thrown into the back of a
garbage truck. You must start over.

There is nothing easy or safe about being unhoused. But the
reality is that far too many people have no other option due
to circumstances out of their control.
