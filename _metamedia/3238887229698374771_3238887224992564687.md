So again, we understand there will be legal challenges to face. We're not trying to get

arrested haphazardly. No one’s trying to do that to spend money. And again, not to make a
spectacle of our own struggle, because our own struggle is not what's important. But if they
want to come at us in the hardest way they can, then that’s a fight that we're prepared to
fight because we understand that we're on the right side of history, and so are the people.

And I should say that I also come from a different political collective that does a lot of
funding legal support for direct action against imperialism. And we step into this saying to
our comrades that if folks are called to take direct action, there is capital support for legal
funds, for bail funds behind this that we will stand behind.

Fergie Chambers: Well, yeah, so as an aside, I think maybe the focal point of the domestic
movement against the violent arms of the state here in the US right now this year has been
the fight in Atlanta to stop Cop City. And right now we have a four-day mass mobilization
called Block Cop City where there are lots of events and trainings going on, and there's a call
to mass action on Monday. So we've come down as a Palestine action contingency to
participate in all of that. I also spent a decade organizing in anti-police work in Atlanta. This
is really my background coming up in this.

So those of us who have organized in Atlanta understand that the occupation is an integral
piece of the militarized police state in Atlanta, because Atlanta plays host to the Georgia
International Law Enforcement Exchange, GILEE, which is the largest cross-training
program from Zionist and American cops. And it'’s been housed at Georgia State University
for more than 30 years by now.
