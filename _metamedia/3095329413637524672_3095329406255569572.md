7 Your Communist Dad
LR ,' @urcommunistdad

On the left, the CIA actively
promoted various anticommunist
ideologies, doing its best to
exacerbate ideological splits within
the communist movement and
putting its thumb on the scale in
favor of any form of radicalism other
than Marxism-Leninism, the only
ideology they feared.
