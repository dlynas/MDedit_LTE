HOW CAN THOSE WHO ARE NOT SEEN AS
‘“HUMANS”’ IN THE EYES OF THE
OPPRESSORS BE THE ONES TO INITIATE A
PROCESS OF DEHUMANIZATION? HOW CAN
THOSE WHO EXPERIENCE CONSTANT
VIOLENCE BY BEING OPPRESSED BE THE
ONES TO INITIATE VIOLENCE? IS THE BOY
THROWING A STONE AT A TANK
‘““VIOLENT?”’ IS THE YOUNG MAN TRYING
TO END THE SIEGE ON GAZA ‘‘VIOLENT?”
IS THE WOMAN PUSHING BACK TO TRY TO
HALT POLICE BRUTALITY ‘‘VIOLENT?”
HOwW CAN THEY BE?
