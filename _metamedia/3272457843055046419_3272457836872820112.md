Alison Frank Johnson, a history
professor, said she “couldn’t be more
dismayed.”

“Instead of making a decision based on
established scholarly principles, we had
here a public hounding,” she said.
“Instead of listening to voices of scholars
in her field who could speak to the
importance and originality of her
research, we heard voices of derision and
spite on social media. Instead of following
established university procedure, we had
a Corporation granting access to self-
appointed advisers and carrying out
reviews using mysterious and
undisclosed methods.”
