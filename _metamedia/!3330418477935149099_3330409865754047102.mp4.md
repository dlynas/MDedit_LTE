No six year old should see their neighbor getting shot for buying bread for their family.
That was growing up in Palestine.
There's moments like that when you're face to face with the occupation, with the occupier.
And other days you're affected by them in other ways, cutting off electricity for days, shutting off water for days, missing school because they would just block the road.
Yeah, this is the reality of the occupation period since it's existence. That's what they've been doing.
You know, they're stealing our land, taking our home, taking over our culture. They're pushing us out by these tactics.
You know, whether it's verbal, using words like that or physical like having checkpoints and roadblocks making your life miserable.
Of course, a lot of people are going to end up leaving. How do you have a good, healthy, happy life in other occupations when you're constantly being oppressed and mistreated?
