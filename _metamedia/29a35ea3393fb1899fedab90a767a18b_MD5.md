Claire Lehmann & @clairlemon - 3h

When | first joined Twitter in 2013, the site
was overwhelmingly populated by left-leaning
users, & | watched people get bullied off the
platform for left-wing heresies. Today,
however, people are bullied off for right-wing
heresies, @Samharrisorg being a case in
point.

Truth is that Twitter has low upside & high
downside for many creators at this point.
Click throughs to articles are lower on this
platform compared to others, so even if
Twitter exposure is large, it doesn’t
necessarily translate to revenue. It’s rational
to leave.
