Complete shocker, putting into law the concept
that the Palestinians are not allowed to have
human rights, only Israelis, and that the
Palestinians will be punished if they have the
temerity to ask for their human rights to be
upheld. Why isn't every American journalist
screaming about this obvious injustice?

â€œLimits aid to the Palestinian Authority if "the
Palestinians" initiate or support an International
Criminal Court investigation against Israel "for
alleged crimes against Palestinians" x.com/
