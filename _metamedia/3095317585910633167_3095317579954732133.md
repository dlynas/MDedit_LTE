On May 1st, Jordan Neely was on the F train
in New York City.

Jordan, who was having a mental health crisis, was asking
passengers for food and water, and expressed that he
wanted to go to jail just so he could have shelter and food. A
Marine, whose name has yet to be released by officials, put
Jordan in a chokehold in response to what he reportedly
deemed 'erratic behavior.'

Video captured of the incident and posted to social media
shows Jordan being held down by the Marine and another
passenger. A man who was on the subway during the incident
told NBC New York that the chokehold lasted for about 15
minutes. People on the subway stood around and filmed as
Jordan was murdered.

According to local reports, the NYPD confirmed that they
took the Marine in for questioning and released him later the
same day without any charges. A city medical examiner ruled
Jordan's death a homicide on Wednesday. The Manhattan
District Attorney's office said that they are investigating.
