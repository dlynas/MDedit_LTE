The 2nd Principle
—_— . ———
by @laylafsaad

Liberation is ‘for me’
and ‘for we’.

Liberation that only serves ourselves is
a manifestation of supremacy thinking
and domination culture. Liberation
that only serves others is a
manifestation of internalised
oppression and self-betrayal.

Liberation work is both deeply
PERSONAL and for the COLLECTIVE.
None of us are free until all of us are
free.

I.I B E RATI 0 N Liberation work invites us to practice

solidarity, care, love, and justice with
ourselves and others.
