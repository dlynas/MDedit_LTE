The world is hurting, we’re meant to hurt with it,
not insulate ourselves from it. But discernment is
important because isolation & loneliness are
sources of distress that can very much be
addressed. So, the struggle isn’t the problem,
struggling in isolation is. Wanting to have a
better life is not the problem, but wanting that
for yourself without thinking of the collective is.
Our struggles are connected & they are meant to
be addressed as such, not in isolation.
