| think thatâ€™s fair. | think it is entirely appropriate
that people should receive for themselves what
they want for others. | think the extent of your
good will toward your fellow man should come
round to you in full, and | think the extent of
your ill will should as well.

If what | am saying makes you feel
uncomfortable, then perhaps this would be a
good time for you to re-evaluate what you want
for the Palestinians. Perhaps this would be a
good time to assess whether your attitude
toward Palestinian people is one of integrity,
one which offers others the same regard with
which you yourself would want to be regarded.
One which truly treats others as you want to be
treated. And perhaps it would be a good time to
make some changes in yourself accordingly.
