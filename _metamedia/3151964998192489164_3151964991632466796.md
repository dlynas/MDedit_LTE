Expressing your feelings and needs without
attacking/blaming/criticizing. E.g., "I'm feeling uneasy
about how we left the conversation. | understand you're
also overwhelmed, and I'd like us to reconnect later
tonight."

Tip: Practice PAUSING before you express. Yes, this likely
is very difficult for you, but it is necessary! Start with 1
second and slowly increase the time.

Note to distancing partners: any signal that it's not
personal goes A LONG WAY for your pursuing partner.
Understand they aren't trying to hurt you; they feel
anxious and are desperately fighting for safety and
connection.
