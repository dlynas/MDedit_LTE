Wondering how the requested $14.3
billion of YOUR money will be spent?

$10.6 billionis slated to be allocated toward air and
missile defense support - $3.7 billion will strengthen
Israel’s military and enhance U.S. embassy security:

¢ Precision-guided munitions kits to turn regular bombs into
precision weapons and artillery shells

¢ Rapid transfer of ammunition for the Iron Dome, David’s Sling,
and Iron Beam from the U.S. emergency stockpile, which serves
to shield Israel from resistance during its attacks on Gaza.
