Helpful Context for Frustrating Conversations About Gaza //

“Hamas is using civilians as human shields.”

As Israeli officials peddle the narrative that “Hamas is using
civilians as human shields”, allow history to be instructive:

As noted by Jacobin, “Following past Israeli military
operations in Gaza in 2009 and 2014, Amnesty International
repeatedly investigated “human shields” accusations” and
found no evidence to back up the accusation that Hamas
uses civilians as human shields.

Israeli occupation forces, on the other hand, have been
documented to have used Palestinian detainees as human
shields on more than one occasion through the years. Every
accusation is a confession.
