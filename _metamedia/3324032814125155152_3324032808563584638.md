It's a stage where every negative emotion is lingering in
your conscious on stand by- ready to fire at any time.
These emotions are now even triggered by life's
smallest blessings, instead of only misfortunes. These
emotions flood in, cycling rapidly from rage to disbelief,
hate to shock, heartbreak to frustration all at oncein a
split of a second. Your nervous system goes on
overdrive and then shuts down- before youre even able
to process what you experienced in that moment.
