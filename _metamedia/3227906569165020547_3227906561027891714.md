A hate group wants SCOTUS to repeal
Washington state’s ban on conversion
“therapy” for LGBTQ+ minors.

“Fresh off its victory in 303 Creative v. Elenis, the Alliance
Defending Freedom has returned with another anti—-LGBTQ
rights case cued up for the Supreme Court this session.
The case in question—Tingley v. Ferguson—involves Brian
Tingley, a licensed marriage and family counselor, who is
challenging Washington state’s law banning conversion
therapy for minors. Tingley, who is being represented by
ADF lawyer Kristen K. Waggoner, claims that this ban
violates his First Amendment rights.

Tingley is actually arguing his case on two fronts, claming
that as a Christian therapist, the law infringes on his rights
to both freedom of speech and free exercise of religion. The
practice of conversion therapy has been widely debunked
and discredited by several major health organizations and
has been proven to be harmful to the LGBTQ+ community.

Tingley’s lawsuit, which was first filed in 2021, was initially
dismissed by a U.S. district court the same year; in 2022,
the Ninth Circuit Court ruled that Washington’s conversion
therapy ban did not violate the state Constitution. While the
Supreme Court’s conservative majority has been
particularly interested in First Amendment cases as of late,
it's unclear if they will choose to take it up.”
