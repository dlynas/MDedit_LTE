Did you know that after they switched to blind auditions, major symphony
orchestras hired women between 30% to 55% more? Before bringing in “blind
auditions™ with a screen to conceal the the candidate, women in the top 5 major
orchestras made up less than 5% of the musiclans performing.

so | believe It was actually more complicated than that, in interesting ways.
Because at first, when they did blind auditions, they were STILL hiring more
men.

...Then they put down a carpet. so that high heels didn't clack on the floor, and
BOOM women were suddenly getting hired.

The testers didn't even know that's what they were picking up on, which just
goes to show how tiny of a cue it takes for misogyny to kick in.

The case of blind auditions for orchestras and how it dramatically changed the
gender makeup of orchestras Is a very llluminating example of gender bias, and
an interesting possible way of countering it.
