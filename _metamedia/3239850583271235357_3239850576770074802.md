#lsrael's military has released footage
allegedly showing resistance fighters taking
Israeli detainees to get medical care at Al
Shifa Hospital. The army claimed that treating
the detainees makes medical centers military
targets.

The statement contradicts a previous claim by
the IOF that the resistance destroyed all
cameras at the hospital.

Hamas had already stated two days ago that
it took some detainees to medical centers to
get treated before moving them back
somewhere else.
