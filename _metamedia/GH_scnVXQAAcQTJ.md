He's the worst president in the history of our country.
There's never been anything like what's happening to our
country. Today, it was announced that 325,000 people
were flown in from parts unknown. Migrants were flown in.
Airplane, not going through borders, not going through
that great Texas barrier that I was with the governor of
Texas, Greg Abbott, the other day, and we were looking at
the job they're doing.

But in the meantime, they're pouring into California and
they're pouring into Arizona because those governors
aren't doing anything. They're doing nothing. But today, it
was just announced before I came out. It was
unbelievable. I said, that must be a mistake. They flew
325,000 migrants, flew them in over the borders, into our
country.

So, that really tells you where they're coming from. They
want open borders, and open borders are going to destroy
our country. We need borders, and we need free and fair
elections, and we don't have a country.
