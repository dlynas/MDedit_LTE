The 4th Principle
by @la;afsaad

Love is the path and
the point.

Love is WHY we do the work of justice
and liberation, HOW we do it, and
WHERE we are trying to get to.

We do this work for love, through love,
and to love.

Love is the opposite of supremacy. It is
a “combination of care, commitment,
knowledge, responsibility, respect and
trust” (bell hooks).

LOV E Love embodies the full spectrum of our
humanity, from our joy and our hope,
to our grief and rage. Love is a practice,
nota performance.
