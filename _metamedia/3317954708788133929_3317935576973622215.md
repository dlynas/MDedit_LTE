Stop trying to figure out “who you are.”
This is an individualistic Western idea that
we have all been brainwashed into through
various modes of capitalist story-telling. In
other words, movies, T.v. and CIA-funded
writing styles raised us to think that life is
about finding our “true self,” or whatever,
instead of trying to get free. Those same
stories tell us we are as free as the birds.
You have to analyze how many narratives
of how we think about our life come from
the people that benefit from our
exploitation and destruction.
