“Why did Hamas kidnap more than
200 innocent Israeli civilians?”

Before October 7th, the number of
Palestinians behind Israeli bars was
5,200, including 170 children. 1,200 of
them are administrative detainees,
which means they are held indefinitely,
with no trial nor charge (AKA
"kidnapping"). Within the past 2 weeks,
Israel kidnapped another 1,500
Palestinians and threw them in Israeli
jails. We may assume that Hamas took
Israelis as prisoners to exchange them
for the Palestinian prisoners.
