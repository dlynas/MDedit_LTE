BREAKING: HAMAS OFFICIAL STATEMENT

â€œThe American draft resolution that was
rejected during today's vote in the UN Security
Council contains misleading wording that is
complicit with the goals of the criminal zionist
enemy, enabling it to continue its aggression,
and giving it cover and legitimacy for the war of
genocide that it is committing against our
Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. The
resolution does not include an explicit demand
for an immediate cessation of the zionist
aggression against Gaza.
