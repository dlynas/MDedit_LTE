Two million Palestinians in Gaza, a 225-square mile
Mediterranean coastal enclave, have been besieged
by a comprehensive naval blockade and land siege
imposed by Israel for 16 years. The UN and
humanitarian organizations have condemned the
blockade as illegal and described its impact
as “catastrophic”. In 2015, a UN Agency predicted that
Gaza would be unlivable by 2020 due to a lack of

hygiene, access to clean water, and food shortages
caused by Israel. It is now 2023. Today, more than a
quarter of all reported diseases in Gaza are caused by
poor water quality and access. Fifty-three percent of

the population is living below the poverty line and
dependence on food aid for survival has increased
from less than ten percent in 2000 to an estimated 70
percent in 2017. Between the fall of 2016 and the
summer of 2017, 186 facilities providing health, water,
sanitation, and solid waste collection services were
shut down due to power shortages due to the siege
and blockade
