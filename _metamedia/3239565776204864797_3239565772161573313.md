There is a scene in the film Guardians of the Galaxy where
Rocket, a perpetually aggrieved, physically-enhanced raccoon,
objects to a suggestion that he join a mission to save the galaxy
from an Infinity-Stone-wielding bad guy.

Rocket Raccoon: What has the galaxy ever done for you? Why
would you wanna to save it!?

Peter Quill: â€™Cause I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!

I was reminded of this scene recently, when I had the good luck
of listening to two Palestinian and Jewish Israelis talk about
their efforts to build a grassroots movement to address a range
of social, economic, and environmental issues. All that... and an
end to the occupation and a lasting peace between Israel and
Palestine.
