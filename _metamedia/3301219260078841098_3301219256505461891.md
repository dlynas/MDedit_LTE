Empathic imagination is what allows you
to understand that the leap between
your child and someone elseâ€™s is no
leap at all. More than a million people
are being bombed in a neighborhood
they were ordered to evacuate to. A
little girl starved to death among her
decomposing relatives, while nearby the
emergency workers sent to rescue her
were charred to bits. This should either
jolt you to grief or jolt you to question
your humanity. Not to feel beckoned to
do so is the byproduct of successful
dehumanization.
