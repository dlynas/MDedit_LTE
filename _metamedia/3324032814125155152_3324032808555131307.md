In this stage, you question every streak of luck that life
threw at you. The realisation that it's pure randomness
of luck that determins people's life outcomes- is both
SCARY and debelatating. It's also a thought that now
sits permanently in the back of my mind, clouding every
decision, achievement, circumstance | encounter.
