THE SECOND MISTAKE IS WHAT I
WILL CALL “HUMANIZATION": I
PORTRAYED MY PEOPLE ONLY IN
THE WAYS THAT ADHERE TO
ETHNOCENTRIC CIVILITY,
ROBBING THEM OF THEIR AGENCY.
I MADE THEM TREMBLE IN THEIR
VICTIMHOOD LIKE STICKS IN THE
WIND. THEY WERE MERE VEHICLES
FOR EXTRACTING EMPATHY. IT
WAS THE TENDENCY TO “WOMEN
AND CHILDREN” PALESTINIANS TO
DEATH, TO INFANTILIZE
PALESTINIANS IN HOPES OF
PROVING THAT, INDEED, THEY
DESERVE LIBERATION.
