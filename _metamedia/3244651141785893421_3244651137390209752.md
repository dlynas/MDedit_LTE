The biggest obstacle to we human
folk changing course around the
unfolding ecological catastrophe is
human supremacy in various forms.

The enactment of racist, colonialist,
gendered, religious, and economic
supremacies lead to mistrust, division,
and early death for the humans and
for many of our Earth kin. Plus it
stresses everyone who doesn't die right
the fuck out so they can't focus on
meaningful structural change.
