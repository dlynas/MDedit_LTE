Statement in Response to the 2024 Benedictine College
Commencement Address

The sisters of Mount St. Scholastica do not believe that Harrison
Butker's comments in his 2024 Benedictine College
commencement address represent the Catholic, Benedictine, liberal
arts college that our founders envisioned and in which we have been
so invested.

Instead of promoting unity in our church, our nation, and the world,
his comments seem to have fostered division. One of our concerns
was the assertion that being a homemaker is the highest calling for
awoman. We sisters have dedicated our lives to God and God's
people, including the many women whom we have taught and
influenced during the past 160 years. These women have made a
tremendous difference in the world in their roles as wives and
mothers and through their God-given gifts in leadership,
scholarship, and their careers.

Our community has taught young women and men not just how to
be "homemakers‚Äù in a limited sense, but rather how to make a
Gospel-centered, compassionate home within themselves where
they can welcome others as Christ, empowering them to be the best
versions of themselves. We reject a narrow definition of what it
means to be Catholic. We are faithful members of the Catholic
Church who embrace and promote the values of the Gospel, St.
Benedict, and Vatican Il and the teachings of Pope Francis.
