How did they reach you from the "New York Times"?
"Through the [Instagram] story. At first | didn't attach any
meaning to it, | didn't understand how important it was, but
they didn't give up. They called me again and again and
explained how important it is to Israeli hasbara. They really
invested in it, it was important for them to know every detail,
and | understood from them that this was significant visual
evidence of the sex crimes committed on October 7, that's
why they clung so much to my testimony. | saw how it was and
1 said OK, I'll help them, so the whole world will know. | had
dozens of conversations with them, photographs, recordings.
The two reporters who spoke with me, Adam Sella and Anat
Schwartz, repeatedly went down to the smallest details,
shooting angles, distances, minutes. It was important for them
to verify every detail."
