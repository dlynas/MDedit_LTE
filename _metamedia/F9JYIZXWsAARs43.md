This is solidlydocumented. Between 2012 and 2018, Netanyahu
gave Qatar approval to transfer a cumulative sum of about a

billion dollars to Gaza, at least half of which reached Hamas,
including its military wing. According to the Jerusalem Post, ina
private meeting with members of his Likud party on March 11,
2019, Netanyahu explained the reckless step as follows: The
money transfer is part of the strategy to divide the Palestinians in
Gaza and the West Bank. Anyone who opposes the establishment
of a Palestinian state needs to support the transfer of the money
from Qatar to Hamas. In that way, we will foil the establishment
of a Palestinian state (as reported in former cabinet member Haim
Ramon’s Hebrew-language book “Neged Haruach”, p. 417).
