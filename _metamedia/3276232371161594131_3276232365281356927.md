| understand how difficult it is to abandon
the beliefs and orientations shared by
family, loved ones, and elders. But in this
moment, | am asking my Jewish friends
and family to have the openness and the
sheer humanity to look at the genocide
unfolding before our eyes and speak out
against it. Our identity as Jews is being
used to justify the same atrocities that our
ancestors suffered. The information is
there. Please look with open eyes.
