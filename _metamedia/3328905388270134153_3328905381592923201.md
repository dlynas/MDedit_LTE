Ramadan is a time we push ourselves to question
what it is that we really NEED to survive and how we
can better dedicate ourselves to community in
service of the struggle for liberation. With each day
of fasting, foregoing materialism & excess
consumption, sitting with the associated discomfort
& hunger, we break ourselves down, kill our egos as
best possible, chip away at any illusions, to ultimately
renew our vows to community.

Even if you’re not Muslim, | think some version of this
journey is worth taking. Not the precise “dos & donts”
per say but the ritualistic pursuit of pushing yourself to
identify the bare minimum resources that one needs for the
self such that it expands the capacity of the collective.
