IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CUT DOWN ON DRINKING, IT'S
GOING TO BE HARD TO DO THAT IN AN
ENVIRONMENT THAT TRIGGERS YOU TO DO THAT.
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WANT TO THE PUB ON A
THURSDAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS, BUT YOU'D LIKE
TO GO AND NOT ORDER BEER LIKE YOU USUALLY

DO.

AT FIRST, THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT
BECAUSE THE BRAIN WILL EXECUTE WHATS
PREVIOUSLY BEEN REPEATED (ORDERING BEER).

THE SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO DISCUSS THIS
WITH YOUR FRIENDS, AND PERHAPS START
MEETING AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION, PERHAPS A
BAR OR RESTAURANT INSTEAD, WHERE YOU CAN
ATTRIBUTE NEW HABITS TO NEW ENVIRONMENTS.
