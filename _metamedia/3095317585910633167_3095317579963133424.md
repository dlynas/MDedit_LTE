There is a direct correlation between the way
that the media, government officials, and the
NYPD villainize our unhoused neighbors and
the stigmatization and violence that they face.

Since taking office, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has
been outspoken about wanting to remove unhoused New
Yorkers off of the streets and subways - even saying, "Who
wants to start their day that way with the level of despair
right in front of them?"

The dehumanizing candor of Mayor Adams was put into
action when, in December 2022, he moved to allow first
responders - including the NYPD - to involuntarily commit
unhoused people experiencing a mental health crisis. This
move was highly denounced by organizations working to
combat the houselessness crisis with care and empathy.

But the blame cannot be laid squarely on Adams'
shoulders as the media has played an even larger role in
amplifying a narrative about unhoused New Yorkers...
