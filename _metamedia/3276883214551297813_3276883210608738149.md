There is absolutely nothing wrong with joining in
with the opposition now. You can safely dismiss
anything in you that feels self-conscious about not
getting this until now, or feels like it would be
inauthentic to join an activist cause after it has
gained popularity. Changing your position and
taking a stand now makes you more authentic,
because it shows you are living a life guided by truth
and compassion rather than sleepwalking through
life guided by blind habit and partisan tribalism.
