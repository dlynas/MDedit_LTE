    - it also purports to contain several credible eyewitness testimonies. One was delivered by a survivor of the Nova electronic music festival named Raz Cohen

A paramedic in an Israeli commando unit said that he had found
the bodies of two teenage girls in a room in Be’eri.

One was lying on her side, he said, boxer shorts ripped, bruises by
her groin. The other was sprawled on the floor face down, he said,
pajama pants pulled to her knees, bottom exposed, semen smeared
on her back.

Because his job was to look for survivors, he said, he kept moving
and did not document the scene. Neighbors of the two girls killed —
who were sisters, 13 and 16 — said their bodies had been found
alone, separated from the rest of their family.

The Israeli military allowed the paramedic to speak with reporters
on the condition that he not be identified because he serves in an
elite unit.
