The systemic oppression that we and

our ancestors face(d) defines our
relationships, interactions & shapes
our interpersonal problems

To mobilize for change, you must
bridge the political with the
personal-i.e. understand the
impact of systemic trauma and
apply social justice values in your
relationships to heal in community
