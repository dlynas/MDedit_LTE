Teachers in Portland are on strike for the
first time in the city’s history.

“Teachers in Portland, Oregon, walked off the job on
Wednesday for the first day of a strike that shuttered
schools for some 45,000 students in Oregon's largest city.

Concerns over large class sizes, salaries that haven't kept
up with inflation and a lack of resources prompted the
strike. "Our kids deserve more than teachers that are
absolutely exhausted and at the end of their ropes," said
Sarah Trapido, a special education teacher at Kellogg
Middle School.

The Portland Association of Teachers, which represents
more than 4,000 educators, said it was the first-ever
teachers strike in the school district. The union has been
bargaining with the district for months for a new contract
after its previous one expired in June.

Schools are closed and there is no classroom or online
instruction during the strike. The district is scheduled to
meet with the union and a state mediator on Friday.

Nearly two weeks ago, the union announced that 99% of
teachers voted in favor of the labor action, with 93% of its
members participating in the ballot.”
