o

nently. To demand that the Palestinians, or Arabs, or for
that matter anyone, accept Israel’s right to exist is to grant
Israel something that no state in the international system
has. No state is granted a right to exist. They’re recog-
nized, but not granted a right to exist.

In the case of Israel, that would require the Palestini-
ans to recognize the legitimacy of their expulsion—not
just the fact but its legitimacy. It’s as if Mexico were re-
quired to accept the right of the United States to exist on

 half of Mexico, gained by conquest. Mexicans don’t accept
that, nor should they. Almost every border in the world is
the result of conquest. The borders are recognized, but no-
body goes on to demand that the legitimacy be recog-
nized, especially by a population that was driven out.
