Liberation & freedom are
uncomfortable processes

| don'’t think we talk enough about how
uncomfortable the pursuit of liberation is. If
we're doing the right thing, it should feel
great right? Well, not exactly. Parts of it will
feel incredible in ways you have never felt
before. Attempting to “live my best life”
while the world is on fire is is not only
impractical but dissociated from reality and
thus, a recipe for eternal disappointment.

The more | face the world and examine my role in it,
the more | see that life is not about running from the
struggle but about learning to struggle together. It is
about navigating distress, discomfort, fear, pain
together— not fixating on making it better for our
individual selves while majority of the world starves.
It’s not just about the ethics or morality of it, but do
we really think that running from the struggle will
yield a fulfilling, joyful life? Do we really think that
avoiding pain is a recipe for happiness?
