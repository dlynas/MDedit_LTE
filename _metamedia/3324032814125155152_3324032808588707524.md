Psychiatrists need to revisit all the research they've
conducted on grief. What I'm experiencing today, after
witnessing fellow human beings being slaughtered and
starved for 157 days, doesn't fit into the five stages of
grief. What im feeling is beyond denial, anger,
bargaining, depression, or acceptance. It's a stage that
is scary, heavy, hopeless and sucks the life out of you
every second of every day.
