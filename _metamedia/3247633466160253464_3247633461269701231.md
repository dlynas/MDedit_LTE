Been seeing this go around today & while | don’t think
Spotify needs defending, | think context is important
in preventing misinformation.

Spotify operates at a loss - unless consumers accept a
major $$ increase, Spotify couldn’t change the royalty
rate w/o going bankrupt. To combat this they found
that of the 60k-100k songs A DAY that are added to
the platform (a large amount being bots), 2/3 get <1k
streams ($3) a year which they figured could be better
used to increase the royalty rate. As in, if you have a
listenership that's enough to generate meaningful
royalties (as in >$5 a year), then you'd actually wind
up making more $ from this policy.

Also “regulating” streaming makes no sense because
if the government set a rate then Apple & Amazon
would have a huge market advantage against Spotify &
Tidal. Spotify/Tidal would be forced to increase their
prices while Apple & Amazon could keep them the
same (or even lower prices) since they, obviously, have
other revenue sources.

If you wanna be mad at anyone for failing to “regulate”,
look at labels who could’ve leveraged their massive
catalogs to get fairer deals but instead recieved equity

in Spotify.
