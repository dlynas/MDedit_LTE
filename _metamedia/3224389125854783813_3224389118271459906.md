How can people mourn Israeli victims, condemn the
massacres committed by Hamas, but look at what is
happening in Gaza and believe that anything could ever
justify this ongoing catastrophe?

Israeli politicians are using vengeance as a tool to enact a
new, terrible wave of ethnic cleansing onto Gaza. The
perversion of their intent is revealed by their obvious
disregard for the hostages' lives.

And the West supports them with prayers, troops, and
weapons.

Ever since the West had an active hand in the founding of
the state of Israel, it has watched and ignored Palestiniansâ€™
realities, facilitating the untenable situation in Gaza and all
of Palestine. The West, and Germany in particular, have
been criminalising peaceful Palestinian resistance for
years. Boycott is deemed antisemitic, calling for a free
Palestine is deemed antisemitic. And now that Israel has
paid a devastating price for the first time since the second
Intifada, the West is condoning genocide, instead of
pressuring Israel to agree to a ceasefire.
