An Update on Gaza:
What You Should Know
February 1.2024

Israel continues its human rights abuses
and war crimes in Gaza.

In the last week:

- During the past week, large numbers of Palestinian men have
been observed by the UN being detained by the Israeli military at
a checkpoint within the city of Khan Younis, with many of them
stripped to their underwear, blindfolded and taken away.

On January 30, Palestinian civilians were shot at and injured at
Al Kuwaiti roundabout in Gaza city as they gathered to receive
humanitarian aid. This is the fourth reported incident of civilians
coming under fire while gathering for food supplies.

On January 29, at least 20 Palestinians were killed, and others
injured, when a residential building was struck in Gaza city.

On January 29, 6 Palestinians, including 4 children, were shot
and killed while driving in their vehicle in Khan Younis. A 6-year-
old girl survived but emergency medical services were unable to
reach her for three hours due to fighting.

On January 25, two Palestinian brothers, one of whom was a
child, were shot and killed with live ammunition while evacuating
from their home in Al Amal neighborhood, western Khan Younis,
following the evacuation order issued by the Israeli military. The
child was shot three times while carrying a white flag, and his
brother was shot while attempting to rescue him.
