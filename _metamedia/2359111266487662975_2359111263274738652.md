“Self-made” billionaires acquire their wealth by
exploiting the working class. Two examples:

Jeff Bezos, world’s richest man and
CEO of Amazon, where employees
qualify for food stamps, can be
fired for taking bathroom breaks,
and suffer notoriously bad working
conditions. He makes more in one
minute than his warehouse
workers make in one year.

The Waltons of Walmart are the
world’s richest family. Walmart is
regularly sued for illegal labor
violations (forcing people to work
off the clock, denying overtime
pay) and subjecting employees to
terrible working conditions. They
give almost none of their own
cash to their charity.
