[ donâ€™t have to be convinced that
Donald Trump is bad for the
nation. I remember what he did
and turned people into. I was in
the white evangelical church
through the Trump years. I
remember how he gave them
justification for their
dehumanization of everybody not
white. How they made him the
second coming of Christ.
