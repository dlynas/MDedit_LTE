Dr. Claudine Gay tap danced like they
wanted her to, refusing to speak the simple
truth - that no one is calling for a genocide

of Jewish people when they say ‘From the
River to the Sea,” on a US college campus.

They lynched her anyway. For the record,
she didn’t plagiarize anything, she
improperly cited material - allegedly.
The narrative that this is simply a right-wing
hit job is ludicrous. Liberal institution,
liberal city, liberal state. So-called liberals
(zionists included) sell accomplished black
intellectuals down the river all the time.
