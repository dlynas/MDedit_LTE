At some point people in the west will
realize that you too need to fight, break
s**t, break rules, throw Molotovs, take
up arms, and the sooner you realize that,
the closer we all are to being free-er.
People here are stuck in a delusion, stuck
obeying, conforming, assimilating, on a
lonely path to nowhere. Many say they
want to be free but are actually desperate
for the masters approval more than for
liberation. Some day, you too will realize
you have to fight, you had to fight all
along, there was never ever any other
choice or any other route to liberation.
Voting, politicians, colonial/ capitalist
institutions, none of that s**t will save us.
We will save us when we realize we have
to fight for us and take risks collectively.
