These "rubber bullets" now maiming students protesting
for Gaza in US cities were first pioneered by the British
Army in Northern Ireland during the so-called "Troubles."

They killed 17 civilians. 8 of them were children under 16.
None were armed.

Birds of a colonial feather.

Police are shooting rubber bullets at UCLA student kids: "I can tell you
from doing stories about rubber bullets, they are extremely painful. If they
hit your leg, your arm, they could break your arm."
