The paramedic who told this false story was
pitched to western media by the Israeli govt. He
has backed off his story now that video
disproves it.

But here’s an important detail: The Israeli govt
told the NYT that actually the paramedic
STANDS BY HIS STORY! Incredible willingness
to lie in the face of video evidence and even the
witness himself backing off. NYT dutifully
printed the claim.
