Consider the alternate possibility that
Democrats aren't botching or losing.

Consider the possibility that they are doing
exactly what they set out to do, and are
winning for the donor class.

botched the debt limit situation. But there's a
pattern of very poor strategic decision-making
by leadership across the party. This was
predictable, people warned leadership about it...
