Our understanding of the problem dictates our
understanding of the solution. The conflict framework
relies on certain premises and resolution paradigms.

Just by describing something as a “conflict”,

mostly equal sides  that the two sides get them to stop

So just by describing it as an “Israeli-Palestinian conflict”,
you are inducing people to think:

how can we get the Palestinians to agree?”

This treats “both sides” as having equally legitimate
demands that can and must be compromised on.
