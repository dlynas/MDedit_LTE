12. Whatever the World Court eventually
decides, and it is almost impossible to imagine it
won’t determine that Israel carried out a
genocide, it will be too late. The western

political and media class will have moved on,
leaving it to the historians to decide what it all
meant.

13. Meanwhile, Israel is already using the
precedents it has created in Gaza, and its
erosion of the long-established principles of
international law, as the blueprint for the West
Bank. Saying Hamas has not been completely
routed in Gaza but is using this other Palestinian
enclave as its base, Israel will gradually intensify
the pressures on the West Bank with another
blockade. Rinse and repeat.

That’s the likely plan. Our job is to do everything
in our power to stop them making it a reality.
