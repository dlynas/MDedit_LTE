E.g."I'm feeling overwhelmed and need some time to
process. Can we come back later on?"

Tip: if expressing is too difficult, write it down and give it
to your partner. Then SLOWLY, increase the amount you
express.

Note to pursuing partners: although communicating may
sound easy and obvious, it's important to recognize that
this is likely very difficult for your partner because they're
feeling triggered. They often don't communicate not
because they are trying to hurt you but because they are
UNABLE to.
