g@& SEXUAL VIGLENCE iN'CONFLICT

63.  The mission team conducted a site visit to Be’eri and witnessed first-hand the magnitude
of destruction within the kibbutz with rows of houses burnt, riddled with bullets and many
reduced to rubble.

64, The mission team examined several allegations of sexual violence. It must be noted that
witnesses and sources with whom the mission team engaged adopted over time an increasingly
cautious and circumspect approach regarding past accounts, including in some cases retracting
statements made previously. Some also stated to the mission team that they no longer felt
confident in their recollections of other assertions that had appeared in the media.

65. At least two of the allegations of sexual violence previously reported were determined by
the mission team to be unfounded, due to cither new superseding information or inconsistency in
the information gathered, including first responder testimonies, photographic evidence and other
information. These included the allegation of a pregnant woman whose womb had reportedly
been ripped open before she was killed, with her fetus stabbed while still inside her. Another
such account was the interpretation initially made of the body of a girl found separated from the
rest of her family, naked from the waist down. It was determined by the mission team that the
crime scene had been altered by a bomb squad and the bodies moved, explaining the separation
of the body of the girl from the rest of her family. Allegations of objects found inserted in female
genital organs also could not be verified by the mission team due in large part (o the limited
availability and low quality of imagery.
