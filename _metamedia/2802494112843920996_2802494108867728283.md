Most of our employee base and potential employee base live paycheck to

paycheck. Any increase in gas price cuts into their disposable income. As inflation
continues to climb and gas prices continue to go up, that means more hours employees
will need to work to maintain their current level of living.

We are no longer competing with the government when it comes to hiring. Stimulus
money is no more, supplemental unemployment is no more. This benefits us as prices
rise, people who we relying on unemployment money, simply will have less money to
spend. It will force people back into the work force.

Furthermore, other competitors ( especially mom and pop companies or smaller
businesses) will have to either raise prices, cut employee hours, or pay employees less
hourly to hit their profit margins. Some businesses will not be able to hold on. This is
going to drive more potential employees into the hiring pool.

We all competed to hire out of the limited applicant pool and there was a wage war.
We all saw businesses hiring team members at $18-520 an hour. They will no longer be
able to afford to do this. Trucking is the backbone of America and as fuel costs rise, so
will the charges for shipping. If those costs cannot be passed on to the customer in
terms of menu price, the only area they can cut sizable costs will be in labor.

The labor market is about to turn in our favor. What can you do?

Besides hiring employees in at a lower wage to decrease our labor ( when able ) make
sure you have a pulse on the morale of your employees. Your employees that live check
to check are impacted more than the people reading this email. Be conscious of

that. Many will need to work more hours or get a second job. Do things to make sure
you are the employer of choice. Get schedules completed early so they can plan their
other jobs around yours. Most importantly, have the culture and environment that will

attract people.
