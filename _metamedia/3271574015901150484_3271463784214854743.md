BY DEFINITION, OPPRESSION IS AN ACT OF
VIOLENCE, AND THE CREATION OF AN
OPPRESSED INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF
PEOPLE IS ALWAYS A VIOLENT ACT. TO
OPPRESS IS TO ACTIVELY STRIP AWAY
SOMEONE’S HUMANITY. THE OPPRESSED
ARE THE PRODUCT OF VIOLENCE AND NOT
THE INITIATORS OF VIOLENCE. THOSE
TRYING TO ACHIEVE LIBERATION, TO NO
LONGER BE OPPRESSED, RESPOND TO THE
OPPRESSOR’S VIOLENCE BUT ARE NOT
THEMSELVES THE GENERATORS OF
VIOLENCE.
