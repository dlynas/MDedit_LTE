Hey @washingtonpost, actual question:

Did you run *any* front-page lead-story headline like this about the
economy and related "gloom" in 2020, when the unemployment rate was
3X current level, when Covid deaths were 25x current level, when there
was more reason for actual gloom? And how it "cast a pall" on election?
