Uber and Lyft will pay $328 million to New
York drivers after years of wage theft.

“Uber and Lyft will shell out $328 million in settlements to
New York drivers after cheating them out of their fair pay for
years, according to a settlement announced by the state
Attorney General Letitia James’ office.

Uber will pay the lion’s share of the settliement funds—$290
million—after taking sales taxes and fees for the Black Car
Fund, a nonprofit that provides workers’ compensation
insurance and health and safety programs, from drivers’
payments from 2014 to 2017 when those fees should’ve
been paid by passengers, James’ office said. Lyft will pay
the rest—$38 million—after doing the same thing but from
2015t0 2017.

Both companies also failed to provide drivers with the paid
sick leave they had been entitled to under city and state
law. Now, as part of the settlement drivers will receive paid
sick leave of up to 56 hours of paid sick leave annually. The
companies also agreed to pay drivers outside of New York
City a minimum guaranteed hourly pay of $26.

More than 100K New York drivers will be eligible to receive
the settlement funds and benefits negotiated through the
AG'’s office, which are slated to take effect by February.”
