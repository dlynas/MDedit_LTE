scene from the film killers of the flower moon indigenous native americans

Osage wealth has been stolen and trying to bleed them for as much money as they could,
and then literally bleeding them tilling them for that money.
So it was just like everybody was kind of in awe.
The lawyers were involved, the bankers were involved, the prosecutors, the guardians.
Osages were deemed competent, right?
And so they needed a white man to guide them and show them how to spend money.
But this basically led to a system of exploitation.
Conspiring together to make sure that they could marry into these Osage families and take their money.
The Koch brothers made out like bandits, pilfering billions and billions of dollars worth of oil.
They've gone on to build a huge, very conservative empire where they are using that money to battle climate change science.
They're still non-Osage benefiting from those deaths.
