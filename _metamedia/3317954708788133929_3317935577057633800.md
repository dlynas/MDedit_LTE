Young people have so much energy and
revOlutionary potential, but a lot of it gets
siphoned off into the empty pursuit of “self.”
“Who am I? What should | be?” Be you! “But |
don’t know who | am!” Who you are is what
you do, how you love, the lines you hold, the
ways you treat others, the fierceness with
which you fight for principles—that’s you,
and every day you are becoming yourself
more and more. Develop and live your
principles daily, and there you are. Your life
will find you, you will find your life, and you
will be aligned, and the idea of your “isolated
self,” will fade in importance.
