Herbie Hancock: "Because it's not the music that
matters anymore. People don't care about the music
itself anymore, but about who makes the music. The
public is more interested in celebrities and how a
certain artist is more famous than music. It changed
the way the audience relates to music. He no longer
has a transcendental connection to music and its
quality. Just wants the glamour. Jazz doesn't want to
be part of it. Do you know why? It's not about
humility, or arrogance, a posture ''we don't want to
be famous, we're underground". None of that. Jazz is
about the human soul, not about the appearance.
Jazz has values, teaches to live the moment, work
together, and especially to respect the next. When
musicians gather to play together, you have to
respect and understand what the other does. Jazz in
particular is an international language that represents
freedom, because of its roots in slavery. Jazz makes
people feel good about themselves.‚Äù
