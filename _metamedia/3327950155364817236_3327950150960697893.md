Never normalize inequity, oppression,
poverty. Never normalize and simply

“step over” or look away from
unhoused, hungry, poor people to
simply “move on” with your self-
centered life. Never think that leaving
behind the most marginalized people
in our communities is going to help
you secure your safety or happiness. In

fact, it is costing you your humanity;
your soul.

There is no joy & happiness at the end
of this road, only justified shame,
guilty, emptiness, loneliness,
resentment & more discontentment.
