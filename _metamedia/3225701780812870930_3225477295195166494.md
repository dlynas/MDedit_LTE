“The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a
complex issue that is hard to understand
and even harder to solve”

The story of Palestine is a simple case of colonization and
dispossession. It has been told before: European settlers
arrive in a foreign land, settle there, and either commit
genocide against or displace the indigenous inhabitants.
The Zionists have not introduced anything new in this
regard. However, with the help of Western media and
propaganda, Israel has managed to construct a
multilayered narrative so complex that it seems only
Israel itself can understand it.

When you consider instances like the apartheid in South
Africa and the European genocide of the native
Americans, it is evident that these events are publicly
recognized as morally unjust. The Palestinian cause
shares striking similarities with both of these historical
injustices yet people are somehow divided on the matter
because it is a “complex” one.
