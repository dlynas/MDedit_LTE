The fact that all violence within a settler-colonial system
is caused by the brutality of the coloniser does not
legitimise the mass murder of unarmed people. | do not
believe that all means to an end are justified. Yet, its
contextualisation within the settler-colonial system is
crucial in helping us understand, even and especially
when in grief and pain, that if we want any chance for a
more peaceful future, we need to fight the oppression
and subjugation of Palestinians that is the root cause of
all the lives taken.

What | said two years ago still holds true to me; | do not
wish to diffuse or complexify solidarity beyond the
immediately necessary, and | am definitely not asking for
people to show “both sides”. | am not saying any of this
in the belief that | could make white people stop centring
themselves in everything. | am saying this for the sake of
nurturing my and my Jewish and Israeli peers’ ability to
keep co-resisting. | feel our pain and | feel our ancestral
fears that are threatening to lead us to despair. | am
saying this to hold space for our grief as an integral part
of our fight against ethno-nationalism, against Jewish as
well as white supremacy, and for the liberation of
Palestine and us all.
