The New York Times is investigating an Israeli journalist who has written several articles
for the newspaper, including a joint byline for the investigative report on the sexual
violence of Hamas terrorists on October 7, after she liked a series of pro-israel posts on
social networks, including one that called for the transformation of Gaza "into a

slaughterhouse" if the hostages held by Hamas are harmed.
