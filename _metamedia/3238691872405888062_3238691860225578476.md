Profits of Israelâ€™s weapons suppliers
USD 54 billion in a month and 10 days
18/11/2023

RTX CORPORATION, USA

RTX shareholders have earned $15.25 billion

since the start of the war on Gaza, as the share
price increased from USD 69.77 before the war to
USD 80.23 now (a 15% profit). RTX is the main
supplier of Iron Dome munitions, which Israel

uses to intercept Palestinian resistance rockets.

The company benefited from the passing of the US
military aid bill after the war began, which included
the deployment of more Iron Dome systems.
