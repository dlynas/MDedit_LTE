US Economy Adds More Jobs
Than Expected in September

The US economy created 263K jobs in September, the least since
April of 2021 but above market forecasts of 250K. Still, the number
points to a tight labor market with an employment level about 500K
above its pre-pandemic level. Meanwhile, the jobless rate fell to 3.5%,
matching July's 29-month low and coming in below market

expectations of 3.7%.
