That is what the Arabs in Palestine are doing, and what they will pcrsis{ in
doing as long as there remains a solitary spark of hope that they will be able to

prevent the transformation of "Palestine" into the "Land of Israel."
Arab Comprehension

Some of us have induced ourselves to believe that all the trouble is due to
misunderstanding â€” the Arabs have not understood us, and that is the only reason why
they resist us ;if we can only make it clear to them how moderate our intentions really

are, they will immediately extend to us their hand in friendship.

This belief is utterly unfounded and it has been exploded again and again. |
shall recall only one instance of many. A few years ago, when the late Mr. Sokolow
was on one of his periodic visits to Palestine, he addressed a meeting on this very
question of the "misunderstanding." He demonstrated lucidly and convincingly that
the Arabs are terribly mistaken if they think that we have any desire to deprive them
of their possessions or to drive them our of the country, or that we want to oppress
them. We do not even ask for a Jewish Government to hold the Mandate of the

League of Nations.

One of the Arab papers, "El Carmel," replied at the time, in an editorial article,

the purport of which was this:

The Zionists are making a fuss about nothing. There is no misunderstanding.
All that Mr. Sokolow says about the Zionist intentions is true, but the Arabs
know that without him. Of course, the Zionists cannot now be thinking of
driving the Arabs out of the country, or oppressing them, not do they
contemplate a Jewish Government. Quite obviously, they are now concerned
with one thing only- that the Arabs should not hinder their immigration. The
Zionists assure us that even immigration will be regulated strictly according to
the economic needs of Palestine. The Arabs have never doubted that: it is a

truism, for otherwise there can be no immigration.
