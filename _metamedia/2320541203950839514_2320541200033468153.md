9 | Stop supporting
organisations that
promote hate

If you read pieces on media platforms
that promote hate or fund supremacist
and hateful organisations, you are
contributing to the problem. Equally,
stop supporting organisations that love
'black culture', but fail to speak up on
issues affecting the black community.
