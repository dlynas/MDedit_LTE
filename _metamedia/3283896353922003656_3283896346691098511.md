“Globalization was brought to many at the 'point
of a gun' and many were ‘globalized’ literally
kicking and screaming”.

Colonialism and capitalist globalization led to
massive inequality among nations and "the early
deindustrialization of the Third World in the face
of the industrialization of the First World".

This is an excellent passage with some useful
tables from the book "Globalization and the
Myths of Free Trade" by economist Anwar
Shaikh.
