I support calls for a ceasefire. If I were in charge, I would have
responded to the October 7 attack by Hamas with an effort to
negotiate a hostage exchange, to isolate Hamas, and to reward
credible alternatives. That said, Israel is a sovereign nation
whose citizens elected the most right-wing government in its
history. Its military response and ground invasion were
predictable and largely immune to outside pressure from global
protests.

When the dust settles, in the coming weeks or months, Israel
will have to decide what it does next. I hope it will be clear to
everyone who cares about peace, justice, and equality in Israel-
Palestine how important groups like Standing Together are in
these movement moments. Change will come when the people
who live in Israel-Palestine, Jews and Palestinians, and who
share these goals, build enough power to make it so. I hope you
will join me in supporting them.
