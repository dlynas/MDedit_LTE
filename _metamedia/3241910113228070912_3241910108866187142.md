The Problem with
Calling for “Peace”

Terms associated with the conflict framework like
“peace” are also problematic. Peace is great, but when
you call for peace in any situation of oppression,
especially colonization, you reinforce the misleading
view that the problem is that two sides are fighting.
But the problem isn’t that they’re fighting — one of them
has a legitimate reason to fight, and should not stop
fighting until they are free.

Of course, many scholars correctly argue that true
peace requires freedom, justice and equality.

But this nuance is lost in mainstream discourse, and
calling for “peace” now can only reinforce the
toxic “conflict” framework among people.

Call for freedom.
Call for justice.
Call for decolonizing Palestine,
from the river to the sea.
