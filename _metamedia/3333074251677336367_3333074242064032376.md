. Stop Cop City

T @JoshuaPHilll
It’s really simple. If you hear that
Muslims in America don’t want to vote
for Biden because he’s supporting
Israel’s ethnic cleansing in Gaza, your
fucking response should be to urge him
to stop supporting the ethnic cleansing,
not to tell people it would be worse
under Trump.
