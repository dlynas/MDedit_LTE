Adam Green's guide to becoming an
artist

1. Decide upon Artist as your
destiny and begin to value your own
visions with esteem and conviction.
You can’t really start until you think
that way about yourself.

2. Work 75% with the things that
come naturally to you and don’t
assume that just because a certain
idea occurs naturally to you that it
is obvious to anybody else.

3. Excavate exactly what it is inside
your head and make that thing in
the outside world.
