With love to my Jewish community:

I'd like to ask how your relationship with
the idea of Israel was formed. How it came
to be. Mine came from my grandpa, who
fought in WWII. He spoke often of his
immense pride in fighting against nazis,
and the importance of Jewish safety and
freedom. For my grandpa, Israel
embodied, in a near literal way, safety and
freedom. That's what Israel was to me as
a kid. My grandpaâ€™s sense of what he had
accomplished, fighting against people
that wanted to kill Jews.
