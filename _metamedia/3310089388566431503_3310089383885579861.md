There are no single answers to
what 1s happening to us. We can,
as Octavia Butler writes, become
the answer to the problems we
face. There are no good choices.
There are worse choices, and
many Americans are making
them. But the choice I make 1s
this: I will not let hatred and fear
get the best of me. I am not
hopeful but I am determined.
