Your inherent expectation that your role
is Msavior", or that you should know and
understand what's best for other nations
after a quick google search, is precisely
what must be dismantled for their
protection.

centering our own opinions and emotions
right now. It is often just an attempt to
demonstrate moral superiority when weâ€™re
too afraid to approach the mirror.

Listen, learn. You are not the hero in
this story. Decenter.
