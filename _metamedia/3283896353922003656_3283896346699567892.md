These female soldiers belong to a military that is starving
pregnant Palestinian women of food and water, forcing

Palestinian women to have c-sections without
anesthesia while killing their premature babies.

It’s the equivalent of publishing a glowing profile of
Germany’s female soldiers during WW2.

There is NOTHING feminist about settlers and genocide.

What a shameful and unforgivable whitewash by the New
York Times.
