In the case of Julian Assange, so-called mature democracies
of the West are systematically disregarding the rule of law
and directly undermining fundamental constitutional
rights Tndispensable to any democratic system: the
prohibition of torture, the freedom of the press, the
‘presumption of innocence and the right toa fair trial. Those
Whojustfy their own indifference by pointing to the
existence of 'worse cases’ are making a fatal mistake that

it mect s high prce froi S oFcr K0T s el h
big picture of what really is at stake here-the proverbial

elephant in the room'. At worst, they deliberately bury their
‘heads in the sand while:

investigative journalism is being
ruthlessly criminalized, persecuted and annifilated. Only
the day that they themselves are arbitrarily arrested will
_they pull their heads back out of the sand and realize that

thereis no one left to speak up for them.
