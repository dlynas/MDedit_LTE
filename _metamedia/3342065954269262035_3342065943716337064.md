YOU MUST TEACH THAT SOCIALISM-COMMUNALISM IS AS OLD AS MAN;
THAT ITS PRINCIPLES FORMED THE BASIS OF MOSTLY ALL THE EAST
AFRICAN CULTURES. THE ONLY INDEPENDENT AFRICAN SOCIETIES
 TODAY ARE SOCIALISTIC. THOSE WHICH ALLOWED CAPITALISM TO

EMAIN ARE STILL NEO-COLONIES
REMAIN ARE STILL NEO-COLONIES.  GEORGE JACKSON
SEP 23,1941 - AUG. 21,197
