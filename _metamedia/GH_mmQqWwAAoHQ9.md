‘ Administration  Priorifies Tt

« Expanding the Parole Process for Venezuelans to Nicaraguans,
Haitians, and Cubans. Today, the Biden Administration is announcing it
will extend the successful Venezuela parole process and expand it to
nationals of Nicaragua, Haiti, and Cuba. Up to 30,000 individuals per month
from these four countries, who have an eligible sponsor and pass vetting
and background checks, can come to the United States for a period of two
years and receive work authorization. Individuals who irregularly cross the
Panama, Mexico, or U.S. border after the date of this announcement will be
ineligible for the parole process and will be subject to expulsion to Mexico,
which will accept returns of 30,000 individuals per month from these four
countries who fail to use these new pathways.
