| am Buddhist, but one does not need
be in order to understand that
aron Bushnell, in the capital of the
.S. Empire, rejecting the military arm
of Empire he was in, was showing
compassion to the people of the
world. Self burning and thus
sacrificing one’s life to demand the
world end suffering, was an act of
ultimate compassion.

Life for the People.
