glad they’re describing it as an uprising now
but don’t forget when it happened they were
writing articles actively condemning it

ﬁ, Joseph Hirsch @josephhirsch5 -1d

Judith Butler describing the October 7
massacre as armed resistance: “We can
have different views about Hamas as a
political party, we can have different views
about armed resistance. But [...] the
uprising of October 7th was an act of
armed resistance.[...] This was an uprising”
