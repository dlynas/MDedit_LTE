Helpful Context for Frustrating Conversations About Gaza //

“There is a Hamas command center
beneath al-Shifa hospital.”

For weeks, Israeli authorities were adamant that Hamas was
operating a critical “command center” beneath it. They spoke
at length about a vast tunnel system—the very tunnel system
that they admitted to constructing themselves back in the early
1980s. The United States government co-signed their claims,
while Hamas, the Gaza Health Ministry and hospital officials at
al-Shifa denied the claims.

(Human Rights Watch U.N. Director Louis Charbonneau told
Reuters that “the Israeli government hasn’t provided any
evidence” of harmful acts being carried out of al-Shifa.)

IOF raided al-Shifa on November 15 following days of fighting
around the hospital, trapping 1,200 patients and staff inside
without fuel or electricity.

What did they find? An assortment of questionably-placed
weapons—which, per a CNN investigation, had been moved
around—a laptop, a “grab bag”, a box of dates, and a calendar
in Arabic, among various other items.

What they predictably did not find was find a “command
center” central to the operations of Hamas.
