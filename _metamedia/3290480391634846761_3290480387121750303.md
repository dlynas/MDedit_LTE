Number 2

Have idols.
Copy your idols.

Modern “creativity” is viewed as “originality” and
that's complete bullshit. You ever see how back in the
day in art school they’d make ppl copy old school
paintings? (Dunno if they still do that, | hope so.)
That's how you hone your craft.

You're a writer? Try a Proust pastiche. A painter? Pair
me a fake Basquiat. A make-up artist? Give me a little
Pat McGrath.

Copy copy copy.

Unbeknownst to you, your own style will develop over
time. But you'll have the technique to back it up.

Ask The Rolling Stones what they were tryna do.
They're like “oh we were just tryna sound like Muddy
Waters.” Yeah ok bro you do NOT sound like Muddy
Waters. But that's cuz they took Muddy Waters so
seriously and practiced so diligently that at some point
something ELSE came out. (It's called The Rolling
Stones.)

Oh another thing. Once you start being nice, don’t
forget to big up your idols every chance you get. Thank
them. You might even get a compliment from them one

day and that’s gonna be the best feeling ever.
