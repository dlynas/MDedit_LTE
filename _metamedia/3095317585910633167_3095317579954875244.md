When we consider the role that the media plays

in the dehumanization and villainization of the
unhoused community - particularly in New York City
- we must point directly to The New York Post.

One doesn't need to dig too deep onto the Post's website to
see headlines about homelessness in the city or instances of
violence committed by an unhoused individual.

Coverage of isolated incidents by the Post and many other
outlets are reported on ad nauseam, promoting the idea that
the unhoused community that is making NYC unsafe. They
strip people of their humanity for cheap clickbait articles that
offer nothing more than manufactured outrage and insulting
language, which plants an idea in the minds of readers.

What's notable is that far too many of these reports offer
little to no criticism of the realities that would lead someone
to be unhoused in the first place; all they do is dehumanize
and villainize individuals who have extremely limited options
for shelter in a city that is deeply difficult to survive in.
