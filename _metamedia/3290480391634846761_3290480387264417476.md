Number 3

Once you're really nice — and you’ll know
you're nice (but you'll be humble thanks to
years 1 through 5 and you'll tell everybody

you'd be nothing without your idols)
BUUUUUUT...

Once you're nice, and you’ve internalized all the
rules, it's time to BREAK THEM.

Do something a little wrong. A little off. You're a
producer? Get rid of that Splice pack. A writer?
Throw in a little grammar mistake in a sentence.
A stylist? Do the exact opposite of your
moodboard just because.

Then, “creativity” becomes this incessant,
interesting dance between technique and rule-
breaking, between copying and regurgitating
something different, between paying tribute to
those who paved the way and getting inspired
by the new jacks, between method and
spontaneity, old and new, etc etc.

Once you've mastered Number 3, you're gonna
have just as much fun as Number 1.
