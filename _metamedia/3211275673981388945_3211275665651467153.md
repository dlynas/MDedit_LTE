Worse, Palestinians have been blamed for their own
suffering for democratically electing Hamas to lead the
Palestinian Authority in 2006. This victim-blaming
narrative obscures the fact that Hamas was not
established until 1987 — twenty years after Israel’s
occupation of Gaza and the West Bank began and
nearly four decades after the mass expulsion and
dispossession of Palestinians during Israel’s
establishment in 1948.
