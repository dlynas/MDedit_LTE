Max Geller: I think it’s important to understand the company that we're targeting here. One
of the reasons Palestine Action has been so successful is that we're singularly focused. Our
direct actions pretty much exclusively target this one company. Elbit Systems is Israel's
argest weapons company. It makes 85% of Israel's drone fleet. You can go on their social
media right now and watch how they boast of the parastatal role they're playing in this
genocidal war on Gaza. They boast of going on bombing missions. They boast on assisting
the Israeli army in its operations. It is, quite frankly, one of the most evil companies on
Earth. Israel's weapons find their way into the hands of the most repressive regimes on
Earth. These drones buzzed over Kashmir and over Armenia during the most recent ethnic
cleansing. To understand the role Israel plays in US imperialism can be seen in the flow of
its weapons, and Elbit's weapons flow more than anyone else’s.

think, in your question, you are talking about different ways of exerting pressure on the

owers that be. Palestine Action’s position is that we will be exerting the pressure ourselves
and daring the powers that be to stop us. I like the way Calla said that earlier. I think the

important thing here is that we can't sit around and wait for governments in the imperial

corps to gain a moral conscience. We need to make the flow of these weapons stop, and we
are powerful enough to do that on our own. It doesn't take hundreds of people to shut down
a factory. It takes a few people with a good plan.

And I think that's why Palestine Action has been so successful and we've seen the ability to
recreate these actions around the country in a short period of time, both around the US and
around the UK. Because all that is really required is a few friends and a willingness to be
brave and cunning. And with just those few things, we can make a material impact in the
weapons trade.
