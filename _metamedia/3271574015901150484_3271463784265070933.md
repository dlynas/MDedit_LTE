WHAT CAN BE MORE LOVING THAN
BREAKING DOWN FENCES AND WALLS TO
END THE SIEGE OF AN OPEN AIR PRISON?

WHAT CAN BE MORE LOVING THAN
DESTROYING THE TANKS AND ARMS THAT
ALLOW THE OPPRESSOR TO MURDER?

WHAT CAN BE MORE LOVING THAN
STANDING UP TO PRECISION MISSILES
WITH HOMEMADE ROCKETS, DEFYING THE
ODDS SO THAT ALL CAN BE FREE?
