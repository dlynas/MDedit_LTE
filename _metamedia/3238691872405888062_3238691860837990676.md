18/11/2023

GENERAL DYNAMICS, USA

The company’s stock rose from USD 219.94 before
the war to USD 246.26 today, a 12% profit for
investors, and a value of USD 6.92 billion. With the
start of the war, the company upped its production
of artillery ammunition from 14,000 to 20,000 shells
per month, to meet the demand of the Israeli army.
In its factories in Texas, General Dynamics also
manufactures MK 82, 83 and 84 aircraft missiles,
which can bring down residential buildings.
