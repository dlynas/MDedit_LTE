” The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations
got a community note...for not understanding
how UN resolutions work.

This admin continues to lie and embarrass
itself to protect a genocide.

A ceasefire could begin immediately if Hamas
would just release the first hostage.

The international community must put
pressure on Hamas to accept the deal on the
table.

TheUNSC resolution 2728 is binding to all UN
members incl. the USA, and does not require
that hostages be released before implementing a
ceasefire. It "demands" an immediate ceasefire,
and also "immediate and unconditional" release
of all hostages.
