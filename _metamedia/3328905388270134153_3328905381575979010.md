The more | suffer, understand the roots of our collective
suffering & face the horrors of the world... the more | look
right at it, the more compelled I feel to risk it all. It also opens
me up to witnessing the breathtaking beauty & joys of the
world. People don’t look away from the bloodshed,
devastation & suffering of the most oppressed simply
because they're ruthless. | think somewhere deep down they
know that if they look, connect, understand, feel, truly feel it all,
then it might just push them to say f**k it, give up their facade of
a life and commit to the struggle for liberation. Maybe people
fear that facing reality may motivate them to join the fight.

I look outside my window and see lonely people living in cement
boxes, their lives completely separate from each other. How is my
survival not dependent on those around me? We’re meant to
wake up every morning and engage in actions that support each
other’s day-to-day survival. We are supposed to feed, clothe,
shelter and care for each other. Instead, many of us spend our
days wasting away, “earning” the right to live, serving
institutions rather than the people. There is nothing natural about
the way most of us currently live. So maybe we shouldn’t just
stick to our pre-existing patterns, comfort zones and predictable
behaviors. Maybe liberation & true contentment will always exist
alongside discomfort & within the struggle, not away from it.
