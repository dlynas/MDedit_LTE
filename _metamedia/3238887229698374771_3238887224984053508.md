Some of us who just made FOIA requests 10 years ago had feds show up at people's doors
for the sake of trying to find information on this program. Not to mention that a lot of the
power brokers who are heavily invested in Cop City, including my family’s company, Cox
Enterprises, including Coca-Cola, Home Depot, Bernie Marcus is an individual funder of the
IDF beyond anybody in the US that I'm aware of through the FIDF. All of those same
supporters who are heavily invested in Cop City are heavily invested in the occupation and
in Israeli businesses.

And they are building Cop City to do cross-training with Israeli cops. So if we can link,
really, the front lines of the most radical movements in the West, the most committed direct

action movements, and link together those pillars of struggle the way that the empire has
linked together their pillars of capital — They're aligned with each other. If we are aligned
with each other in this way and we are willing to escalate and move together, they can't stop
us. And so this feels like a crucial moment of engagement in linking those two struggles
with every other struggle on earth, because our strength is always in our numbers. There

will always be more of us internationally than there are of them trying to push our struggle

back. The people’s struggle, not Palestine Action. The whole thing.
