Is aspiring to be “well” under
capitalism/ colonialism really an
admirable or even achievable goal or is it
yet again removed from reality? Can
you be well, “healed” , spiritually
elevated, and “live your best life”
while majority of the world (yes
majority) struggles to survive?

AND it is a paradox because severing yourself from
community to prioritize the narcissistic, self-serving
pursuit of individual wealth, power and status is a recipe
for more ill health.

March 10 was the first fast of Ramadan
— a month of deliberate minimalism,
relationship building, community service
and introspection for practicing Muslims.
It is a purposeful shift that can leave you
transformed for the better. As with any
religious or spiritual practice, it is what
you make of it. To me and many who
take a politicized approach to Ramadan,
it is a month for intentional
decolonization and centering.
