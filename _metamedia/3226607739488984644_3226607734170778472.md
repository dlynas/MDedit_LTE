FOR CONTEXT

Why does the U.S. send billions of
dollars to Israel every single year?

The U.S. began providing funding to Israel in 1949 - the year
after it was created. Initial funding was intended to help Israel
build their economy. However, since 2000, nearly 90% of
annual U.S. aid to Israel has funded their military.

U.S. aid provides a multibillion-dollar cushion that allows
Israel to avoid hard choices of where to spend its own money
and thus allows Israel to spend more on expanding segregated
Jewish settlements, maintaining the siege on Gaza, and
controlling millions of Palestinians under an apartheid regime,
as confirmed by Western, Palestinian and even Israeli human
rights bodies.

In 2016, then-President Barack Obama signed a 10-year, $38
billion aid package to Israel - the largest agreement in U.S.
history - this is where the annual $3.8 billion in funding is
currently coming from.
