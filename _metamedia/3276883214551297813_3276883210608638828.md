Please disregard anything in you that has been
holding back from helping to facilitate that
awakening in whatever small way you can, whether
that might be due to shame for not getting involved
sooner or due to any kind of cringe around activism
and political engagement you may have had before.
This thing is so much more important than any of
us, and it's so much more important than any little
feelings of self-consciousness we'd have about
getting involved in ways we never would have
imagined before. This matter is much too urgent for
you to pay any attention to those misguided forces
within you that are resistant to taking a stand here.

Take your stand. It will be welcomed, and you will be
glad that you did for the rest of your life.
