This Way to Change is essential
reading for anyone intimidated by the
challenges we face collectively, or the

changes they hope to make individually.
At once clear, digestible, profound,
and deeply inspiring, it grounds ‘living
your best life’ in principles that connect
self-betterment to a better world for
everyone—a refreshing reframe we so

desperately need right now.
