Imagine that you “find yourself.” What
does that even mean? As if you are some
static being. As if sitting in some
meditative state for years is going to
present you to yourself. | know you follow
the 1G gurus lol, but foo, these mfers out
here telling you about chi and sh!t, sitting
in plush homes draped in White power and
privilege. If “finding yourself” doesn’t
simultaneously mean realizing that you are
trapped in a Colonial system that you need
to bust out of, then you didn’t find sh't
more than accepting your own oppression.
