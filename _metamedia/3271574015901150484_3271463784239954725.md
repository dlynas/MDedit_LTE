‘““FOR THE OPPRESSORS, HOWEVER,
IT IS ALWAYS THE OPPRESSED (WHOM
THEY OBVIOUSLY NEVER CALL ‘THE
OPPRESSED’ BUT...THOSE PEOPLE’
OR ‘THE BLIND AND ENVIOUS
MASSES’ OR ‘SAVAGES’ OR ‘NATIVES’
OR ‘SUBVERSIVES’) WHO ARE
DISAFFECTED, WHO ARE ‘VIOLENT,’
‘BARBARIC,” ‘WICKED,’ OR
‘FEROCIOUS’ WHEN THEY REACT TO
THE VIOLENCE OF THE
a OPPRESSORS.”’
