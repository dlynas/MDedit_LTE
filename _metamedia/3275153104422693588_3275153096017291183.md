If you do not wish to make those changes, then
perhaps this would be a good time to sincerely
examine why that is. If you do not believe
Palestinians ought to receive the same
treatment that you yourself believe you should
receive, perhaps you should elucidate for
yourself exactly why that is. Perhaps you should
elucidate it out loud, out in the open, under your
own name, like an authentic human being.

In any case | again repeat: | want for you what
you want for the Palestinians. May you receive
in this life exactly what it is that you want for the
Palestinians, deep down in your heart of hearts,
whatever that might be. May you receive it in
full, and may you receive it soon.

| offer this to you in all sincerity, whatever that
might mean for you.

Amen.
