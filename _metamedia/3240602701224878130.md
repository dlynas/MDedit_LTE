In Gaza it is illegal for Palestinians to collect

rainwater because Israel considers it properly of
Israeli government.

Think about that for a second.

To have laws on the books that oppress
Palestinians from drinking free water from the
skies shows you EXACTLY the time of apartheid

regime Israel has.

Even dogs, slaves, and prisoners everywhere get
to benefit from rainwater.

But not Palestinians in Gaza.
