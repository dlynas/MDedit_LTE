A team from a nearby unit
encountered a Palestinian family of
10, none of whom was a terrorist.
Gradually it became more difficult to
believe we were in a battlefield. It
was, after all, also a civilian
neighbourhood. These memories of
the fighting and the destruction we
left behind us will forever haunt me.
