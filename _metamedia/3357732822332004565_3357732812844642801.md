3. If Hamas accepts the “deal” and agrees to
return some of the hostages, the bombing eases
for a short while but the famine intensifies,
justified by Israel’s determination for “total
victory” against Hamas — something that is
impossible to achieve. This will simply delay, for
a matter of days or weeks, Israel’s move to step
5 below.

4. If, as seems more likely, Hamas rejects the
“deal”, it will be painted as the intransigent
party and blamed for seeking to continue the
“war”. (Note: This was never a war. Only the
West pretends either that you can be at war
with a territory you’ve been occupying for
decades, or that Hamas “started the war” with
its October 7 attack when Israel has been
blockading the enclave, creating despair and
incremental malnutrition there, for 17 years.)
