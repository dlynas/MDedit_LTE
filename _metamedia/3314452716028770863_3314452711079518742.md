I can’t talk about how I’'m taking care of myself or
moving through life on day 147 of this genocide. I'm
not the same. I've said that countless times.

Truth is, this moment should break us all down and
rip us apart. No, it shouldn’t force us into nihilism —
although the gravity of the last days are easily
remedied by falling into despair — but it should force
us to fundamentally change, to understand and walk
through the world entirely differently. This is a
moment that demands a seismic shift both
individually and collectively. We must refuse and
struggle against any world that would allow this
travesty of the human imagination to even happen in
the first place.

Normalize nothing. Demand everything.
