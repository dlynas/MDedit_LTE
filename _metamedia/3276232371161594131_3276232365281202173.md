Most Jewish Americans were taught a
history of Israel that erased

Palestinians altogether. There was Israel,
and there were terrorists. That idea lives
in the consciousness of many American
Jews, and it needs to be named so it can
be dismantled. | remember being in 5th
grade and having a Hebrew school
teacher who was Israeli, and had served
in the Israeli military. She reveled in telling
us how she could assemble, disassemble,
and reassemble a machine gun in under a
minute. She was so proud of that. It
represented a deep expression of strength
and pride. But there was such violence
and hatred seated directly beneath those
sentiments. And this was in Hebrew
school, teaching a bunch of 11 year old
kids. Who was that gun meant to shoot?
That question was never addressed. It
was left to be filled in by our impression of
who the enemy was.
