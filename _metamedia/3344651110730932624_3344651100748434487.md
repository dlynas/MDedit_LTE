FREED FROM & FRIEND

God of once friends,

We are heavy with relational doubt, never certain if
we are truly known or loved. We have been forgotten,
compared, uninvited. We’ve been kept around and used
to make others feel superior. Help us to sense and
walk away from poisoned belonging, knowing it is not
our duty to make our friendship available for the
plundering of any wanderer. Grant us that wisdom
which tells us when to stay and when to find new
people to trust with our souls. Draw us closer to those
whose love for us is rooted in sacred mutuality—the
belief that we are not just welcomed but that we are
vital to the life and beauty of the collective. And as
we evolve, as we apprehend our true selves, may our
standing in the collective always be clear. Let who we
are becoming be honored in the place where we are, or
be protected as we depart. May it be so.
