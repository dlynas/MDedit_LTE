Last night US Secretary of State Anthony
Blinken moved this script on by stating Hamas
was “the only thing standing between the
people of Gaza and a ceasefire... They have to
decide and they have to decide quickly”.

5. The US will announce that Israel has devised
a humanitarian plan that satisfies the
conditions Biden laid down for an attack on
Rafah to begin.

6. This will give the US, Europe and the region
the pretext to stand back as Israel launches the
long-awaited assault — an attack Biden has
previously asserted would be a “red line”,
leading to mass civilian casualties. All that will
be forgotten.
