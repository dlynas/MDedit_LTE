WHEN I FIRST STARTED WRITING,
I MADE TWO MISTAKES. FIRST:

I TRAINED MYSELF TO USE
‘UNBIASED’ WORDS. WHAT I’'D
REFER TO IN ARABIC AS
AN ‘ENTITY’ WOULD BECOME
A ‘STATE.’ I WANTED
MY VOCABULARY VOID OF
ACCUSATIONS, SO I REPLACED
‘ARROGATE’ WITH ‘CONFISCATE,’
‘DISPOSSESS’ WITH ‘EVICT,’
AND ‘LIE’ WITH ‘ALLEGE.’

THIS PHENOMENON IS COMMON
AMONG WRITERS WRITING ABOUT
PALESTINE, WRITERS WHO
WORSHIP THE MYTHOLOGY OF
OBJECTIVITY INSTEAD OF
SATIRIZING IT.
