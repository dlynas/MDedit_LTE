[ THE TEXAS TRIBUNE

Lubbock is now the fourth, and largest,
county to pass an “abortion travel ban”
in Texas.

“Three county commissioners approved an ordinance that
would bar pregnant people in Texas from traveling through
the unincorporated area of Lubbock County for an abortion
in another state.

The Lubbock commissioners — Jason Corley, Terence
Kovar and Jordan Rackler — voted for the ordinance, which
can only be enforced by private citizens who file lawsuits
against people assisting pregnant Texans seeking an
abortion. Commissioner Gilbert Flores, and County Judge
Curtis Parrish abstained from voting.

Lubbock County is now the largest county to weigh in on
the policy pushed by anti-abortion activists. It joins three
other rural counties — Goliad, Mitchell and Cochran — in
Texas that have already passed similar ordinances,
despite the state already having one of the most restrictive
bans on abortion in the U.S.

The ordinance is being backed by the same people who
started the “sanctuary city” ordinance movement before
Roe v. Wade was eventually overturned. In 2021, Lubbock,
the county seat, was the largest city to pass a “sanctuary
city for the unborn” ordinance.”
