Correct Terms

The term “Israeli-Palestinian conflict” has
unfortunately infected our discourse so much
that many people might struggle to use an
alternative. Here are some:

@ The Palestinian struggle
Q{ The Palestinian cause <«—
The Israeli colonization of Palestine
@/ The Israeli occupation of Palestine
@ The Israeli oppression of Palestinians

This is the term used _by
palestinians In Arabic

This isn’t a conflict between two sides.
This is a cause for ending colonization.
An unrelenting struggle for

freedom, belonging, and life.
