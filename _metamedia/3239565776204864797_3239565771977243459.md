But too much of the global left also doesn’t have a clear plan. No
real plan for how to win; definitely no plan on what to do once
victory is achieved. To quote from another Marvel movie...

Steve Rogers: Stark, we need a plan of attack!
Tony Stark: I have a plan: attack!

Attack is a tactic, not a strategy. Sure, conflict is mobilizing. It
grabs people’s attention. It generates headlines.

It’s also not sustainable. It destroys more than it builds. It
alienates potential allies. Over time, it breeds cynicism and
hopelessness. Over time, it is demobilizing.
