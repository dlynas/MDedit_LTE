The urgency of this moment requires a material view of what we
are witnessing at this very moment:

Instead of negotiating a prisoner exchange - making sure the
hostages can return home alive - Israel is bombing all of Gaza with
relentless aggression. The IDF has dropped far more than 12000
bombs on a piece of land that is only 365km? big. Less than half
the size of Berlin.

Since October 7th, Israel has killed more than 8000 Palestinians.
More than five times more than Israelis were killed by Hamas.
The IDF is dropping phosphorus bombs on one of the most
densely populated areas in the world, while imposing a total
blockade that is cutting off Gazans’ supply of water, fuel, and
electricity, leaving their hospitals unable to treat their wounded and
preventing anyone from fleeing to safety.

More than 200°000 housing units have been destroyed. Hundreds
of thousands of people are being made homeless in an enclave
where 64% of households were experiencing food insecurity even
before this operation started. A population of 2.3 million people,
70% of whom were made refugees and forced into Gaza by Israel
in 1948, have been living under inhumane, cruel conditions for
decades, and are facing massacres and mass displacement for
the fifth time in the last 15 years.

The people in Gaza are living every moment knowing it could be
their last. Whole families have been murdered. Death and loss are
everywhere and constant.

As a descendant of Shoah survivors, | know full well that even the
people who will survive, will never recover from their trauma.
