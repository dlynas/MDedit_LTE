Meanwhile, Israel has killed nearly 215 Palestinians
this year alone, not including the recent death toll in
Gaza. As the most far-right Israeli government in
history oversaw three settler pogroms against
Palestinians in the towns of Huwara and Turmus ‘Aya
and launched an aerial and ground offensive against
the Jenin refugee camp, Western media remained
more concerned with Israel’s judicial crisis. While there
is a mounting consensus among human rights
organizations that Israel is an apartheid regime,
President Biden has advanced and celebrated Israeli
normalization with Arab regimes, ignoring Palestinian
suffering and the overt racism and dangerous
extremism of Israel's government. International
diplomacy together with biased reporting has only
perpetuated Israel’s failed policy aimed at containing
Palestinians in open-air prisons in the hope that they
will just surrender, or at least become a manageable
“problem.”
