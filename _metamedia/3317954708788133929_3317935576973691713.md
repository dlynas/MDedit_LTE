Look, 'm spittin’ from my experience. What
else can I speak from? From everything | have
seen in my life, I am telling you that if you
really want to find what you are looking for,
give up the pursuit of the ambiguous and
amorphous “myself,” and focus yourself on
the tangible things like community and
justice. Your “self” is an elusive shifting
thing, that will mean different things your
whole life, but your dedication to ending
suffering is material and clear. The bonds you
build between people are material, clear, and
life giving. Principles will anchor your life.
