“Israel completely withdrew from Gaza,
therefore it is not occupied”

Even though Israel withdrew Israeli settlers
from Gaza in 2005, it retained effective
control over the territory, which it tightened
further through an unlawful air, sea and land
blockade, and an official policy separating
Gaza from the West Bank, following Hamas’
takeover of the territory two years later. As
a result, the entirety of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip remains under Israeli military
occupation, with Israel controlling the
Palestinian population living there, their
natural resources and, with the exception of
Gaza’s short southern border with Egypt,
their land and sea borders and airspace.
