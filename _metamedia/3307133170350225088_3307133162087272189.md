JUSTICE LIBERATION CHANGE LOVE
isa generational is ‘for me’ needs depth is the path and
journey and ‘for we’ and distance the point

The Good Ancestor Principles are four foundational beliefs that can
guide us through the challenging and rewarding work of
intergenerational justice, healing, and liberation.

The Principles are simple, speak to our spirit, invite sustainability, and
stand the test of time. As we strive to dismantle systems of supremacy and
build a liberated world, these foundational principles keep us grounded in
the values we hold most dear.
