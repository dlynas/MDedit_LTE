Last week, @SecBlinken boasted that "the
Israelis have been not only allowing food in," but
also "working to make sure it gets in and gets to
people who need it." He then took credit for

"doing everything possible to maximize" aid to
Gaza.

Today, he admits that "100% of the population
in Gaza is at severe levels of acute food
insecurity."
