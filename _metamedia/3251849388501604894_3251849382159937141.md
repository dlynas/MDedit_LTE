Now, after this introduction, we may proceed to the subject.

Voluntary Agreement Not Possible.

There can be no voluntary agreement between ourselves and the Palestine
Arabs. Not now, nor in the prospective future. I say this with such conviction, not
because I want to hurt the moderate Zionists. I do not believe that they will be hurt.
Except for those who were born blind, they realised long ago that it is utterly
impossible to obtain the voluntary consent of the Palestine Arabs for converting

"Palestine" from an Arab country into a country with a Jewish majority.

My readers have a general idea of the history of colonisation in other
countries. I suggest that they consider all the precedents with which they are
acquainted, and see whether there is one solitary instance of any colonisation being

carried on with the consent of the native population. There is no such precedent.

The native populations, civilised or uncivilised, have always stubbornly resisted

the colonists, irrespective of whether they were civilised or savage.

And it made no difference whatever whether the colonists behaved decently or not.
The companions of Cortez and Pizzaro or (as some people will remind us) our own
ancestors under Joshua Ben Nun, behaved like brigands; but the Pilgrim Fathers,
the first real pioneers of North America, were people of the highest morality, who
did not want to do harm to anyone, least of all to the Red Indians, and they
honestly believed that there was room enough in the prairies both for the Paleface
and the Redskin. Yet the native population fought with the same ferocity against

the good colonists as against the bad.

Every native population, civilised or not, regards its lands as its national home,
of which it is the sole master, and it wants to retain that mastery always; it will refuse

to admit not only new masters but, even new partners or collaborators.
