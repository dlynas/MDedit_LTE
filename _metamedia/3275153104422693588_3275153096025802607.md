May you receive for yourself whatever it is you
want the Palestinians to receive. If you are a
good person with good intentions, what | just
said is a blessing of the highest order. | am
wishing you life and liberty and health and
happiness. | am wishing you peace and
harmony and human rights. | am wishing you
self-sovereignty. | am wishing you the ability to
live a long life in whatever way you choose to
live it.

If you are a sick person, a depraved person, a
sociopathic person who has other intentions
toward the Palestinians, then | have just cursed
you in the worst way imaginable. | have willed
that the universe give you the very last things
you could possibly want for yourself. And |
mean it sincerely, from the bottom of my heart.
