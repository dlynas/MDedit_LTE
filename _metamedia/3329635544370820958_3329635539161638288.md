We express our appreciation for the position of
Russia, China and Algeria, who rejected the
American project biased towards the aggression
against our people, and stressed the urgent
humanitarian demand for an immediate halt to
the zionist genocide war that has been ongoing
for more than five months, during which the
administration of President Biden provided all
means and tools of military and political support
to the criminal zionist entity in its war on our
people, causing the death of tens of thousands
of children, women and civilians.‚Äù
