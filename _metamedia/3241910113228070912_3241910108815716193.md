Calling it a “eenflict® is also
misleading and dishonest.

Imagine saying the:

= “South African conflict”

= “European-Native American conflict”
= “German-Jewish conflict”

= “French-Algerian conflict”

These were all “conflicts” in the sense that they
technically involved disagreeing parties. But calling them
that would deceive people as to the true nature of what
was happening. It’s dishonest and distortive.

That’s the case with Palestine. Describing it as a
“conflict” completely obscures the nature of the
Zionist colonization of Palestine and severe
oppression, and instead falsely says the fighting is
the problem, rather than the oppression of which
violence is only a symptom.
