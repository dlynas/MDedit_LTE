(1977)

The Right of the Jewish People to the
Land of Israel (Eretz Israel)

a. The right of the Jewish people to the
land of Israel is eternal and indisputable
and is linked with the right to security and
peace; therefore, Judea and Samaria will
not be handed to any foreign

administration;_between the Sea and the

Jordan___there will __only be Israeli
sovereignty.

b. A plan which relinquishes parts of
western Eretz Israel, undermines our right

to the country, unavoidably leads to the
establishment of a "Palestinian_State "
jeopardizes the security of the Jewish
population, endangers the existence of
the State of Israel. and frustrates any

prospect of peace.
