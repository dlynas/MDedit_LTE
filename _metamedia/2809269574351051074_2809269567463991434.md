“We have deluded
ourselves into
believing the myth
that capitalism grew
and prospered out of
the Protestant ethic
of hard work and
sacrifices.
capitalism was built
on the exploitation
Ot bIdCK Slaves and
continues to thrive
on the exploitation
of the poor, both
black and white,
both here and
abroad.”

MARTIN
LUTHER
" KING
