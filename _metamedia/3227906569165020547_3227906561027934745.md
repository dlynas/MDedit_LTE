The U.S. infant mortality rate has risen for
the first time in over 2 decades.

“The U.S. infant mortality rate rose 3%, with 20,538
deaths recorded in 2022, according to provisional data
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
published Wednesday.

The CDC report found there were 5.6 infant deaths per
1,000 live births in 2022, compared to 5.44 per 1,000 live
births in 2021 — marking the first year-over-year increase
since 2001 to 2002 after a decades-long overall decline.

There were increases among all ethnicity groups except
for the infants of Asian women. Deaths among infants of
Black women remained the highest of all the groups, with
almost twice the U.S. average at 10.86 per 1,000 births.

For infants of Native American or Alaska Native women,
mortality rates “increased significantly" from 7.46 infant
deaths per 1,000 to 9.06 deaths in 2022, per the report.

The U.S. has higher infant and maternal mortality rates
than many other wealthy nations — including Canada,
Germany, Australia and Japan, per a 2022 report from
the Commonwealth Fund.”
